PostHog is an open-source analytics platform that enables teams to understand how their product is being used and how to improve it. We’ve recently doubled down our focus on “nailing funnels” as a milestone towards our 2023 vision of:

> __“Everyone building a product has a clear path to making it successful without losing control of their data.”__

Here’s why:

## Funnels are a common starting point to identify a product’s path to success

Every new user goes through some kind of activation flow. Funnels are a window into how the experience for new users is performing and the first place to start diagnosing problems.

## Funnels are the fulcrum for growth

For products in the growth stage of their lifecycle, increasing the number of successful users is likely the headline metric. You need an effective activation flow to successfully grow this metric.

People will drop off at each stage of activation for different reasons. Understanding what those reasons are and resolving them is a tightly balanced combination of art, science and detective work.

Funnels unlock a view into each stage of the activation flow and shed light on what might be causing users to be unsuccessful. It’s much harder to understand why someone dropped-off than why they were successful — since they’re not likely to be engaged enough to speak to you. 

But through intelligent breakdowns and session recordings you can build a clearer picture of why people are dropping off—and what you can do about it.

## Funnels are a universal language

No matter how new you are to building products; a simple waterfall visualization illustrating where users are dropping off during their activation journey instantly tells a thousand stories of how people are using your product.

This makes funnels an effective way to communicate to various stakeholders about problems and opportunities you need to solve for your users.

## We have high engagement with funnels today

We’ve currently got strong engagement from our existing users with our funnels feature,. with around 50% more insights being discovered per user through funnels than through any other feature in our toolkit. 

To us, this is a really strong indicator of the potential that funnels have for our users.

## Our other features heavily compliment funnels

PostHog offers an [entire toolkit](https://posthog.com/docs/features) to understand the success of your product today. We’ll be able to tightly integrate these other tools into the Funnels experience to make it trivial to get to the bottom of your user activation challenges.

For example, imagine you’re looking at your onboarding funnel and you see a bunch of people dropping-off before the second page of your signup form. You’ll be able to quickly look at a sample set of screen recordings and understand what happened causing them to drop off — perhaps the next button isn’t rendering correcting in their browser or they’re getting an unusual error message?

We’re really excited to build out our Funnels product over the next few weeks and cannot wait to share it with our community. Check out our tutorial on how to get started with the Funnels feature [here](https://posthog.com/docs/tutorials/funnels).

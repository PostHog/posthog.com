 # Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose a potential security issue.

At the moment, this project does not have a dedicated security contact or published policy. Until one is established, we recommend:

- Reporting low-risk findings via a GitHub Issue (if appropriate).
- For sensitive disclosures, contacting a core maintainer privately (e.g. via GitHub profile email or team contact info).
- Avoid publicly disclosing exploitable vulnerabilities until responsibly triaged and resolved.

We encourage contributors and security researchers to work with us to ensure the safety of PostHog and its users.

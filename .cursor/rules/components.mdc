# Component structure and naming

**Radix UI**
- Custom components go in `/src/components/RadixUI`


### Radix UI

We use Radix UI components. To get them to match our design, we typically create our own version of these components and place them in `/src/components/RadixUI`.

Use `Radix` prefix for imports, then wrap as `<Tabs />`, etc. Example:

```
import { Tabs as RadixTabs } from 'radix-ui'
```

This allows us to have simple naming conventions for our components like `<Tabs />`.

### Other components

We also have custom built components (for things that are outside the scope of Radix primatives). They start with `OS` in the name, like:

1. ``/src/components/OSButton`
1. `/src/components/OSFieldset`
1. `/src/components/OSIcons`
1. `/src/components/OSTable`
1. ``/src/components/OSTabs`

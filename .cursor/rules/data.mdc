# Hooks for product, customer, and navigation data

PostHog is a multi-product company, so data is stored in strucutred files in few central locations which makes it available across the site.

## Product data

1. @useProduct.ts is the first place to check for product information. This is used for beta products, unreleased products, and other "apps" that aren't fully-fledged products that customers typically pay for. (For example, there are entries for things like Webhooks and Notebooks for the purposes of displaying icons for these products.)
2. If the product's slug or handle isn't found in there, @useProduct.ts is extended using @useProducts.tsx. When referencing product data, only refer to @useProduct.ts and let that file handle the data extending.

## Customer data

We reference customer names, logos, and sometimes quotes in various places on the site. This data is sourced from @useCustomers.ts.

## Navigation menus

[index.js](mdc:src/navs/index.js) is the source for all navigation data. This includes:

1. `companyMenu`
1. `handbookSidebar`
1. `communityMenu`
1. `sexyLegalMenu`
1. `companyMenu`
1. `docsMenu`
1. `pricingMenu`
1. `productMenu`
1. `menu`

During the development of this website (as of June 2025), this file can't be modified because it's in use with the live website. As a result, there are several places where this json data is filtered on the front end.

#### 1. Download CLI

<CLIDownload/>

#### 2. Authenticate

<CLIAuthenticate />

#### 3. Inject

Once you've built your application and have bundled assets, inject the context required by PostHog to associate the maps with the served code.

<CLIInject />

You can verify that the metadata has been injected by checking for the `//# chunkId=...` comment in the minified code.


#### 4. Upload

You will then need to upload the modified assets to PostHog.

<CLIUpload path="./path/to/assets" />

#### 5. Serve injected assets

You *must* serve the injected assets in deployed production app. If you serve a copy of the bundled assets as they were prior to running `posthog-cli sourcemap inject`, we won't be able to use the uploaded sourcemap to unminify or demangle your stack traces.

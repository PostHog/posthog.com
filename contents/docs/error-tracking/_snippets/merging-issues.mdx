You can merge issues representing the same problem from the issue list by:

1. Selecting the primary issue others should be merged into
2. Selecting the issue(s) to merge into the primary issue
3. Clicking the **Merge** button

After merging, all events and properties from the merged issues are added to the primary issue. The merged issues are then deleted (but the underlying events are not).

### Setting up Node exception autocapture

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of v4.5.2 is required, but we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

You can enable exception autocapture when initializing the PostHog client to automatically capture uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections in your Node app. 

```node
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

const client = new PostHog(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    { enableExceptionAutocapture: true }
)
```

If you are using the Express framework, you will need to import and call `setupExpressErrorHandler` with your PostHog client and Express app. This is because Express handles uncaught exceptions internally meaning exception autocapture will not work by default.

```node file=server.ts
import express from 'express'
import { PostHog, setupExpressErrorHandler } from 'posthog-node'

const app = express()
const posthog = new PostHog(PH_API_KEY)

setupExpressErrorHandler(posthog, app)
```

> **Note:** Error tracking requires access the file system to process stack traces. Some providers, like Cloudflare workers, do not support Node.js runtime APIs by default and need to be [included as per their documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/#nodejs-compatibility).

### Capturing exceptions manually

If you need to manually capture exceptions, you can do so by calling the `captureException` method:

```node
posthog.captureException(e, 'user_distinct_id', additionalProperties)
```

This is helpful if you've built your own error handling logic or want to capture exceptions normally handled by the framework.

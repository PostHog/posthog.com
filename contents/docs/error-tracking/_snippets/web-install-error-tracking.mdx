### Setting up exception autocapture

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of v1.207.8 is required, but we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

You can enable exception autocapture for the JavaScript Web SDK in the **Error tracking** section of [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#exception-autocapture). 

When enabled, this automatically captures `$exception` events when errors are thrown by wrapping the `window.onerror` and `window.onunhandledrejection` listeners.

It is also possible to manually capture exceptions using the `captureException` method:

```js
posthog.captureException(error, additionalProperties)
```

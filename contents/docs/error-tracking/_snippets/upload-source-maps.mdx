### Uploading source maps

If your source maps are not publicly hosted, you will need to upload them during your build process to see unminified code in your stack traces, the `posthog-cli` handles this process.

#### Download

<CLIDownload/>

#### Authenticate

<CLIAuthenticate />

#### Inject

Once you've built your application and have bundled assets that serve your site, inject the context required by PostHog to associate the maps with the served code. You will then need to upload the modified assets to PostHog, and ensure that the modified asset bundles are the ones you're serving - if you serve a copy of the bundled assets as they were prior to running `posthog-cli sourcemap inject`, we won't be able to use the uploaded sourcemap to unminify or demangle your stack traces.

<CLIInject path="./path/to/assets" />

#### Upload

<CLIUpload path="./path/to/assets" />

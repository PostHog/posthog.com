To authenticate the CLI, you can call the `login` command and follow the instructions:

```bash
posthog-cli login
```

If you are using the CLI in a CI/CD environment such as GitHub Actions, you can set environment variables to authenticate:

<div className="h-fit overflow-x-hidden">

| Environment Variable | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTHOG_CLI_HOST` | The PostHog host to connect to [default: https://us.posthog.com] | [Project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project#variables) |
| `POSTHOG_CLI_ENV_ID` | PostHog project ID | [Project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project#variables) |
| `POSTHOG_CLI_TOKEN` | **Personal API key** with `error tracking write` and `organization read` scopes | [API key settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#variables) |

</div>

You can also use the `--host` option instead of the `POSTHOG_CLI_HOST` environment variable to target a different PostHog instance or region. For EU users:

```bash
posthog-cli --host https://eu.posthog.com [CMD]
```

To authenticate the CLI, you can call the `login` command and follow the instructions:

```bash
posthog-cli login
```

If you are using the CLI in a CI/CD environment such as GitHub Actions, you can set environment variables to authenticate:

| Environment Variable | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTHOG_CLI_ENV_ID` | PostHog project ID | [Environment settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/environment#variables) |
| `POSTHOG_CLI_TOKEN` | **Personal API key** with `error tracking write` scope | [API key settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#variables) |

Use the `--host` option in subsequent commands to specify a different PostHog instance / or region. For EU users:

```bash
posthog-cli --host https://eu.posthog.com [CMD]
```

```bash
# Upload injected sourcemaps to their release
posthog-cli sourcemap upload --directory ./path/to/assets
```

The CLI reuses the release stored during injection, so you don't need to pass `--project` or `--version` again.

> **ğŸ’¡ Tip:** You can use `--delete-after` option to clean up sourcemaps after uploading them.

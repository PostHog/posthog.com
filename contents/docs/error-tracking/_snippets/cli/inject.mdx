```bash
# Inject release and chunk metadata into sourcemaps
posthog-cli sourcemap inject --directory ./path/to/assets --project my-app --version 1.2.3
```

You need to authenticate before running this command, so the CLI can create or reuse the [release](/docs/error-tracking/releases) for the detected or supplied project and version. The CLI tries to detect project and version information, but you can set them explicitly with `--project` and `--version`. We recommend setting the project, and letting the CLI detect the version, if your project is continuously deployed (the version will be the git commit hash at build time).

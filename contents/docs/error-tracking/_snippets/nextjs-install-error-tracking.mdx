## Server-side installation

Next.js enables you to both server-side render pages and add server-side functionality. To integrate PostHog into your Next.js app on the server-side, you can use the [Node SDK](/docs/libraries/node).

First, install the `posthog-node` library:

```shell
yarn add posthog-node
# or
npm install --save posthog-node
```

For the backend, we can create a `lib/posthog-server.js` file. In it, initialize PostHog from `posthog-node` as a singleton with your project API key and host from [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project). 

This looks like this:

```js file=lib/posthog-server.js
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

let posthogInstance = null

export function getPostHogServer() {
  if (!posthogInstance) {
    posthogInstance = new PostHog(
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY,
      {
        host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
        flushAt: 1,
        flushInterval: 0,
      }
    )
  }

  return posthogInstance
}
```

### Capturing server errors

To capture errors that occur in your server-side code, you can set up a [`instrumentation.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) file at the root of your project. This provides a `onRequestError` hook that you can use to capture errors.

Importantly, you need to:

1. Set up a `posthog-node` client in your server-side code. See our doc on [setting up Next.js server-side analytics](/docs/libraries/next-js#server-side-analytics) for more.
2. Check the request is running in the `nodejs` runtime to ensure PostHog works. You can call `posthog.debug()` to get verbose logging.
3. Get the `distinct_id` from the cookie to connect the error to a specific user.

This looks like this:

```js
// instrumentation.js
export function register() {
    // No-op for initialization
}

export const onRequestError = async (err, request, context) => {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
    const { getPostHogServer } = require('./lib/posthog-server')
    const posthog = await getPostHogServer()
    let distinctId = null
    if (request.headers.cookie) {
      const cookieString = request.headers.cookie
      const postHogCookieMatch = cookieString.match(/ph_phc_.*?_posthog=([^;]+)/)

      if (postHogCookieMatch && postHogCookieMatch[1]) {
        try {
          const decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(postHogCookieMatch[1])
          const postHogData = JSON.parse(decodedCookie)
          distinctId = postHogData.distinct_id
        } catch (e) {
          console.error('Error parsing PostHog cookie:', e)
        }
      }
    }

    await posthog.captureException(err, distinctId || undefined)
  }
}
```

You can find a full example of both this and client-side error tracking in our [Next.js error monitoring tutorial](/tutorials/nextjs-error-monitoring).

## Uploading source maps

import CLIDownload from "./cli/download.mdx"
import CLIAuthenticate from "./cli/authenticate.mdx"
import CLIInject from "./cli/inject.mdx"
import CLIUpload from "./cli/upload.mdx"

If your source maps are not publicly hosted, you will need to upload them during your build process to see unminified code in your stack traces. The `posthog-cli` handles this process.

### Download the CLI

<CLIDownload/>

### Authenticate the CLI

<CLIAuthenticate />

### Generate source maps

Next.js disables source maps by default during production builds to prevent you from leaking your source on the client. You can opt-in with the `productionBrowserSourceMaps` configuration flag.

Set an environment variable to control this so we only generate source maps when building locally (or if you are running a build in CI).

```file=.env.local
GENERATE_SOURCEMAPS=true
```

Once we have the environment variable set, we can configure Next.js to generate source maps.

```js file=next.config.js 
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  productionBrowserSourceMaps: process.env.GENERATE_SOURCEMAPS === 'true'
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### Inject

Once you've built your application and have bundled assets, inject the context required by PostHog to associate the maps with the served code.

<CLIInject path="./.next" />

### Upload

You will then need to upload the modified assets to PostHog.

<CLIUpload path="./.next" />

You must also ensure that the modified asset bundles uploaded to PostHog are the ones your site serves. If you serve a copy of the bundled assets as they were prior to running `posthog-cli sourcemap inject`, we won't be able to use the uploaded sourcemap to unminify or demangle your stack traces. 

Setting up a CI step to build your app and upload the source maps is a good way to ensure this.

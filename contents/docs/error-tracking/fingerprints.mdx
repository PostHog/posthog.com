title: Fingerprints
---

Every captured exception is assigned a fingerprint. This fingerprint is used to group similar exceptions into issues. Fingerprints can also be manually set during capture. This page covers how fingerprints are generated and how they're used.

## How are fingerprints generated?

Fingerprints are generated by considering the following in combination:
- The exception type
- If resolved stack traces are **resolved**
    - If there are in-app stack frames, use the resolved, in-app stack frames
    - If there are no in-app stack frames, use the first frame of the stack trace
- If resolved stack traces are **not** resolved
    - The exception message
    - The unresolved stack frames (the stack trace)

If there are multiple exceptions lead to one another, a single fingerprint will be generated for that chain of exceptions.

### Ensuring accurate fingerprints

[Resolved stack traces](/docs/error-tracking/stack-traces) are critical for accurate fingerprinting. Without accurate stack traces, cannot group exceptions consistently. If you have not uploaded source maps, you should do so following this [guide](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps).

This also means that if the exception **type** or **message** changes from one version to the next, the fingerprint will change. 

## How are generated fingerprints used?

Fingerprints are used to group similar exceptions into issues automatically. Automatic issue grouping is only done when:
- No [issue grouping rules](/docs/error-tracking/grouping-issues) are applied
- No [issue merging](/docs/error-tracking/managing-issues#merging-issues) has been configured
- No [custom fingerprint](#customizing-fingerprints) is set during capture

## Customizing fingerprints

Fingerprints can be manually set during capture. This is a very useful way to group exceptions that are not related to each other. You can find examples of how to do this in the [capture exceptions](/docs/error-tracking/capture#customizing-issue-grouping) section.

In most cases, a single fingerprint maps to a single issue, so setting a custom fingerprint will group exceptions together. 

However, if you have an exception capture that results in a chain of multiple exceptions, those multiple exceptions be resolved into a single fingerprint. This means it is still possible to have a fingerprinted exception appear in a partially related issue.

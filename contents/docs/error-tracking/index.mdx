title: Error tracking
---

> ⚠️ Error tracking is currently released as a beta in feature preview. You can [enable it from within your PostHog account](https://us.posthog.com/#panel=feature-previews). If you have any feedback during the beta, please [share it with us](https://us.posthog.com/?panel=support%3Asupport%3A%3A%3Afalse#panel=support%3Asupport%3A%3A%3Afalse).

Error tracking enables you to track, investigate, and resolve exceptions your customers face.

Errors are captured as `$exception` events which means that you can create insights, filter recordings, trigger surveys, and more in the same way you can for any other type of event.

## Installation

### Python

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of v3.7.0 is required, but we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

Exception autocapture can be enabled during initialization of the PostHog client to automatically capture any exception thrown by your Python application.

```python
from posthog import Posthog

posthog = Posthog("<ph_project_api_key>", enable_exception_autocapture=True, ...)
```

If you're using Django 4.2+, you can enable the exception autocapture integration which will also automatically capture Django errors.

```python
from posthog.exception_capture import Integrations

Posthog("<ph_project_api_key>", enable_exception_autocapture=True, exception_autocapture_integrations = [Integrations.Django])
```

For exceptions handled by your application that you would still like sent to PostHog, you can manually call the capture method:

```python
posthog.capture_exception(e, 'user_distinct_id', properties=additional_properties)
```

### Javascript

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of v1.160.0 is required, but we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

Exception autocapture within the JavaScript Web SDK is remotely controlled via [the PostHog app](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-autocapture#exception-autocapture).

It is also possible to manually capture exceptions:

```js
posthog.captureException(error, additionalProperties)
```

## Functionality

In addition to using events in insights, replays, and surveys as mentioned above customers can also visit the [error tracking page](https://us.posthog.com/error_tracking).

Exceptions are grouped by type, each with aggregated counts and sparklines providing an indication of the severity of each group. You can also search for exceptions containing specific text and filter to see which exceptions affect certain users.

Clicking through to an individual group shows you all the associated exceptions, including the associated stack trace, active feature flags when the exception was captured, and a link to the relevant session replay.

## Custom issue grouping

PostHog attempts to group the same exceptions as a single issue. An `$exception_fingerprint` property is generated during ingestion by PostHog and used to perform this grouping. Setting the `$exception_fingerprint` property on the frontend will override the default flow to allow for custom grouping of certain exceptions.

When using the `captureException` method you can provide `$exception_fingerprint` as an additional property in the functions second argument.

```js
posthog.captureException(error, { $exception_fingerprint: "MyCustomGroup" })
```

Should an exception be autocaptured, you will need to modify the properties before the event is sent. The PostHog config offers a [`before_send`](/docs/libraries/js#amending-events-before-they-are-captured) hook that fires for each event. You can alter the event as part of this callback to add the property:

```javascript
posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", {
  before_send: (event) => {
    if (event.event === "$exception") {
      const exceptionList = event.properties["$exception_list"] || []
      const exception = exceptionList.length > 0 ? exceptionList[0] : null;

      if (exception && exception["$exception_type"] == "SyntaxError") {
        event.properties["$exception_fingerprint"] = "MyCustomGroup"
      }    
    }
    return event
  }
})
```

## Upcoming features

There is a long list of features on our roadmap but we're primarily working towards:

* Actioning exceptions (merging, assigning, resolving, etc)
* Alerting

## FAQs

### Are web workers supported?

Yes. Error tracking will work as long as you initialize PostHog in the [web worker](/tutorials/web-worker). You will need to disable any features that rely on the `window` object:

```js
posthog.init(token, {
    ...
    autocapture: false,
    capture_pageview: false,
    capture_pageleave: false,
    disable_session_recording: true,
    disable_surveys: true,
});
```

To `identify` users in web workers you will need to pass the distinct ID. This can be done via an env variable or sending it via `postMessage` from your main application.

### Can exceptions be sampled / ignored

Returning `null` for a given event in the [`before_send`](/docs/libraries/js#amending-events-before-they-are-captured) hook will cause it not to be captured. You may want to:
- Drop certain types of exceptions
- Randomly sample a subset of all exceptions 
- Sample based on the events properties (e.g. URL or user)

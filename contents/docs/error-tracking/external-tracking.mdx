import Tab from "components/Tab"

Other than assigning issues to team members in PostHog, you can also create issues in other tracking systems you use like GitHub issues or Linear. 

> If you use another issue tracking system and would like to request it, [let us know in-app](https://app.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Aerror_tracking%3Alow%3Atrue).

## Setting up external tracking

You can set up external tracking in the [error tracking settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/configuration?tab=error-tracking-integrations). Click **Connect workspace** and follow the prompts to connect your issue tracking system.

<Tab.Group tabs={['GitHub', 'Linear']}>
<Tab.List>
  <Tab>GitHub</Tab>
  <Tab>Linear</Tab>
</Tab.List>
<Tab.Panels>
<Tab.Panel>

PostHog connects to GitHub by installing a GitHub application. PostHog needs the following permissions:

- Read access to metadata
- Read and write access to code, issues, and pull requests

</Tab.Panel>
<Tab.Panel>

PostHog connects to Linear using a [third-party app](https://linear.app/docs/third-party-application-approvals). PostHog needs the following permissions:

- Create issues for your workspace
- Read access to your workspace

</Tab.Panel>
</Tab.Panels>
</Tab.Group>

## Creating external issues 

Issues can be created from the issue page. In an issue's details page, under **External references**, click **+ Create issue**.

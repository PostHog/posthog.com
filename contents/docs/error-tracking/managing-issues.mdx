title: Manage and resolve issues
---

Our error tracking product gives you multiple ways to help you manage issues and work towards resolution. 

## Update issue status

You can update the status of an issue from the issue page under **Status** or issue list. 

All issues are marked **Active** by default, you can mark them as **Resolved** or **Suppressed** to reflect the current state of the issue. These labels are mainly used to communicate amongst your team. 

- Resolve issues that are fixed, if they reoccur, the issue is reopened.
- Suppress issues that you choose not to action. Typically, this is used for issues that are deemed noisy or not helpful.

You can also filter issues by status in the issue list:

A common workflow is to look for all issues that are **Active** assigned to you or your team, and triage them to be fixed or suppressed.

## View stack traces and event properties

Each issue contains detailed information about the exceptions that triggered it. 

Click the **Stacktrace** tab to see exactly where the error occurred. [Stack traces](/docs/error-tracking/stack-traces) help you pinpoint the line of code and the sequence of function calls leading up to the exception.

Under the **Properties** tab, you can view additional metadata about the exception event.

## Watch session replays 

Error tracking works with [session replays](/docs/session-replay) to help you understand the context of an issue. This is useful for reproducing and debugging issues. 

You can view a session replay for an exception by:
- Selecting an exception in the exception list and clicking the **Session** tab at the top of the page.
- Clicking the **View recording** button besides each exception.

## Assign issues to teammates

Issues can be [assigned to a teammate](/docs/error-tracking/assigning-issues) from the list or issue page. To do this, select the **assignee** option and search for the teammate you want to assign it to, and select them. You can click this dropdown again to remove the assignee.

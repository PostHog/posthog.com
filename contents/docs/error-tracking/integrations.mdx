title: Set up integrations
---

PostHog integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Linear to enhance error tracking with source code context, commit information, and external issue tracking.

| Integration | Capabilities |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [GitHub](#github-integration) | Pinpoint Git commits that cause issues, open files in GitHub directly from stack traces, and create GitHub issues from errors |
| [GitLab](#gitlab-integration) | Pinpoint Git commits that cause issues, open files in GitLab directly from stack traces, and create GitLab issues from errors |
| [Linear](#linear-integration) | Create Linear issues directly from errors and track fixes in your existing Linear workflows |

## GitHub integration

To set up the GitHub integration:

1. Go to [Error tracking settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking) in the PostHog app and find **Integrations**
2. Under **GitHub**, click **Connect organization**
3. Authorize PostHog to access your repositories
4. Select the repositories you want to link

PostHog connects to GitHub by installing a GitHub application. PostHog needs the following permissions:

- Read access to metadata
- Read and write access to code, issues, and pull requests

Once connected, create a [release](/docs/error-tracking/releases) to start using source linking.

## GitLab integration

To set up the GitLab integration:

1. Go to [Error tracking settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking) in the PostHog app and find **Integrations**
2. Under **GitLab**, click **Connect project**
3. Provide the following information:
   - Hostname
   - Project ID
   - A project access token with the `api` scope

PostHog connects to GitLab using a [project access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens).

Once connected, create a [release](/docs/error-tracking/releases) to start using source linking.

## Linear integration

Connect your Linear workspace to create and track Linear issues directly from error tracking.

To set up the Linear integration:

1. Go to [Error tracking settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking) in the PostHog app and find **Integrations**
2. Under **Linear**, click **Connect workspace**
3. Authorize PostHog to access your Linear workspace

PostHog connects to Linear using a [third-party app](https://linear.app/docs/third-party-application-approvals). PostHog needs the following permissions:

- Create issues for your workspace
- Read access to your workspace

## What's next?

After setting up an integration:

1. [Upload source maps](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps) for better stack traces
2. [Create releases](/docs/error-tracking/releases) to link errors to specific deployments
3. [Create external issues](/docs/error-tracking/assigning-issues#creating-external-issues) from PostHog

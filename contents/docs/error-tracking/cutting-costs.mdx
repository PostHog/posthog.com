We aim to be significantly cheaper than our competitors. In addition to our [pay-as-you-go pricing](/pricing), below are tips to reduce your error tracking costs:

## Configure exception autocapture

By default, we capture all unhandled errors and rejections. This can capture more than you need. To reduce which exceptions that are captured, you can configure which types of exceptions are autocaptured in the JS SDK config like this: 

```json
{
  "capture_exceptions": {
    "capture_unhandled_errors": true,
    "capture_unhandled_rejections": true,
    "capture_console_errors": false
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can disable exception autocapture completely in your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/error_tracking/configuration).

## Filtering exceptions clientside

### Suppression rules

import SuppressionRules from './_snippets/suppression-rules.mdx'

<SuppressionRules />

### Burst protection

import BurstProtection from './_snippets/burst-protection.mdx'

<BurstProtection />

### Using the `before_send` hook

import BeforeSendHook from './_snippets/before-send-hook.mdx'

<BeforeSendHook />

## Issue suppression

import IssueSuppression from './_snippets/issue-suppression.mdx'

<IssueSuppression />

## Quota limiting

Like all PostHog products, you can set a [billing limit](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing) for error tracking. When a project exceeds this limit, PostHog will no longer capture exception events until your billing period resets.

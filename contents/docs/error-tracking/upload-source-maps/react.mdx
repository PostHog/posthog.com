If you're using React with Vite, you can enable source maps in your `vite.config.js` file.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    sourcemap: true, // +
  }
})
```

If you're using another build tool like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-sourcemap), consult the documentation for your build tool to enable source maps.

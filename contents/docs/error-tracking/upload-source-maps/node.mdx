If you serve minified bundles in production, PostHog requires source maps to generate accurate stack traces. Here are instructions to enable source map generation for popular build tools:

| Build Tool | Documentation |
|------------|--------------|
| Vite | [Source Map Configuration](https://v3.vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-sourcemap) |
| webpack | [Source Map Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) |
| Rollup | [Source Map Options](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-sourcemap) |

For other build tools, consult their documentation to enable source maps.

<InjectSourceMap />

**✅ Checkpoint** – Confirm that the served files are injected with the correct source map comment in production in dev tools:

```js 
//# chunkId=0197e6db-9a73-7b91-9e80-4e1b7158db5c
``` 

</Step>
<Step title="Upload source map" subtitle="Your goal in this step: Send the processed source maps to PostHog." badge="required">
<UploadSourceMap />

--- 

**✅ Checkpoint** – Before proceeding, confirm that source maps are successfully uploaded to PostHog.

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="CLI version requirement" type="action">

A minimum CLI version of [0.5.25](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/releases/tag/posthog-cli-v0.5.25) is required, but we recommend [keeping up with the latest CLI version](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps/cli) to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

</CalloutBox>

If you are using Flutter Web, ensure source maps are generated

```bash
# example command
# Files are usually under the 'build/web' folder
flutter build web --source-maps
```

Then use our standard [CLI approach](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps/cli) to inject and upload them.

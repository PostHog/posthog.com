Update your Nuxt configuration to also upload source maps after injection:

```js file=nuxt.config.js
import { execSync } from 'child_process'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ...,
  sourcemap: {
    client: true
  },
  hooks: {
    'close': async () => {
      console.log('Running PostHog sourcemap injection and upload...')
      try {
        execSync("posthog-cli sourcemap inject --directory '.output'", {
          stdio: 'inherit',
        })
        execSync("posthog-cli sourcemap upload --directory '.output'", { // +
          stdio: 'inherit', // +
        }) // + 
        console.log('PostHog sourcemap injection completed successfully') 
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('PostHog sourcemap injection failed:', error)
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### Build your project for production

Build your project for production by running the following command:

```bash
nuxt build
```

You can verify the injection is successful by checking your `.mjs.map` source map files for `//# chunkId=` comments. Make sure to serve these injected files in production, PostHog will check for the `//# chunkId` comments to display the correct stack traces.

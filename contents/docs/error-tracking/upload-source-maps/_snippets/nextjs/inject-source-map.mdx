The Next.js package automatically handles source map injection during the build process. No additional configuration is needed.

--- 

**✅ Checkpoint** – Before proceeding, confirm that source maps are being generated and injected into your build. 

Check for a comment like this in your `dist/**/*.js` files:

```js 
//# chunkId=0197e6db-9a73-7b91-9e80-4e1b7158db5c
```

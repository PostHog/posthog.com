The Next.js package automatically uploads source maps to PostHog. You need to serve these injected files in production by running the same build and inject process in CI during deployment.

--- 

**✅ Checkpoint** – Before proceeding:

1. Confirm that source maps are successfully uploaded to PostHog. 


<div className="mt-4 mb-2">

<CallToAction type="primary" to="https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#error-tracking-symbol-sets">
    Check symbol sets in PostHog
</CallToAction>

</div>

2. Confirm that the served files are injected with the correct source map comment in production in dev tools:

```js 
//# chunkId=0197e6db-9a73-7b91-9e80-4e1b7158db5c
```

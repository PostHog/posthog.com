You can configure Angular to [generate source maps](https://angular.dev/reference/configs/workspace-config#source-map-configuration) by adding the following to your `angular.json` file:

```json file=angular.json focusOnLines=5-13
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
          "options": {
            "sourceMap": {
              "scripts": true, // +
              "styles": true, // +
              "hidden": true, // +
              "vendor": true // +
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

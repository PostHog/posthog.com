<Step title="Output source maps for Angular" subtitle="Your goal in this step: Configure your build to generate source maps." badge="required">

You can configure Angular to [generate source maps](https://angular.dev/reference/configs/workspace-config#source-map-configuration) by adding the following to your `angular.json` file:

```json file=angular.json focusOnLines=4-14
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:application",
          "options": {
            "sourceMap": {
              "scripts": true, // +
              "styles": true, // +
              "hidden": true, // +
              "vendor": true // +
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, build your Angular application:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Verify source map generation" subtitle="Confirm source maps are generated">

Confirm that the source maps are generated in the `dist/<your-app-name>/` directory. You should see a `.js.map` file for each JS bundle.

</Step>

<Step title="Inject source map" subtitle="Your goal in this step: Add metadata to associate maps with your code." badge="required">

<InjectSourceMap />

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Verify source map injection" subtitle="Confirm source map comments are present">

Confirm that the served files are injected with the correct source map comment in production in dev tools:

You should see a comment like this in your minified JS files, for example `main-IX6K2QJM.js`:

```js 
//# chunkId=0197e6db-9a73-7b91-9e80-4e1b7158db5c
``` 

</Step>

<Step title="Upload source map" subtitle="Your goal in this step: Send the processed source maps to PostHog." badge="required">
<UploadSourceMap />

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Verify source map upload" subtitle="Confirm source maps are successfully uploaded">

Before proceeding, confirm that source maps are successfully uploaded to PostHog.

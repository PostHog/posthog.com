## Nuxt 3.7 and above

For Nuxt 3.7 and above, the `@posthog/nuxt` module automatically handles sourcemap generation and upload during the build process. 

No manual configuration is needed - follow the [Nuxt error tracking installation guide](/docs/error-tracking/installation/nuxt) to set up the module, and source maps are automatically generated and uploaded when you build your project.

## Nuxt 3.6 and below

For older versions of Nuxt, you'll need to manually configure sourcemap generation and upload using the PostHog CLI.

<Step title="Generate sourcemaps during build" badge="required">

You can hook into the `close` event to generate and upload source maps for your Nuxt application like this:

```js file=nuxt.config.js
import { execSync } from 'child_process' // +

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ...,
  sourcemap: {
    client: true // +
  },
  hooks: {
    'close': async () => {
      console.log('Running PostHog sourcemap injection and upload...')
      try {
        execSync("posthog-cli sourcemap inject --directory '.output'", { // +
          stdio: 'inherit', // +
        }) // +
        execSync("posthog-cli sourcemap upload --directory '.output'", { // +
          stdio: 'inherit', // +
        }) // + 
        console.log('PostHog sourcemap injection completed successfully') 
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('PostHog sourcemap injection failed:', error)
      }
    }
  }
})
```

</Step>
<Step title="Build your project for production" badge="required">

Build your project for production by running the following command:
```bash
nuxt build
```

Post-build scripts should automatically generate and upload sourcemaps to PostHog.

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Verify source map upload" subtitle="Confirm sourcemaps are being properly uploaded">

Before proceeding, confirm that sourcemaps are being properly uploaded.

You can verify the injection is successful by checking your `.mjs.map` source map files for `//# chunkId=` comments. Make sure to serve these injected files in production, PostHog will check for the `//# chunkId` comments to display the correct stack traces.

</CallToAction>

</Step>

<Step title="Next steps" >

After configuring PostHog, update your build and deployment process to serve bundles **injected** with the `chunkId` comments. PostHog relies on these comments to display the correct stack traces. Remember to export the [required environment variables](#authenticating-the-posthog-cli) in your deployment process.

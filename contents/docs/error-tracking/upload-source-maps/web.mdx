If you serve minified bundles in production, PostHog requires source maps to generate accurate stack traces. Here are instructions to enable source map generation for popular build tools:
| Build Tool | Documentation |
|------------|--------------|
| Vite | [Source Map Configuration](https://v3.vitejs.dev/config/build-options.html#build-sourcemap) |
| webpack | [Source Map Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) |
| Rollup | [Source Map Options](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-sourcemap) |

For other build tools, consult their documentation to enable source maps.

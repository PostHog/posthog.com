<Steps>

<Step title="Install the PostHog Rollup plugin" badge="required">

  Vite uses Rollup under the hood, so you can use the PostHog Rollup plugin to upload source maps:

  ```shell
  npm install @posthog/rollup-plugin
  ```

</Step>

<Step title="Add PostHog plugin to your Vite config" badge="required">

  Add the PostHog plugin to your `vite.config.js` file:

  ```js file=vite.config.js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
  import posthog from '@posthog/rollup-plugin'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      posthog({
        personalApiKey: process.env.POSTHOG_API_KEY, // Personal API Key
        envId: process.env.POSTHOG_ENV_ID, // Environment ID
        host: process.env.POSTHOG_HOST, // (optional) defaults to https://us.i.posthog.com
        sourcemaps: { // (optional)
          enabled: true, // (optional) Enable sourcemaps generation and upload, defaults to true
          project: 'my-application', // (optional) Project name
          version: '1.0.0', // (optional) Release version
          deleteAfterUpload: true, // (optional) Delete sourcemaps after upload, defaults to true
        },
      }),
    ],
  })
  ```

  Set the following environment variables:

  <div className="overflow-x-hidden">

  | Environment variable | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | [Personal API key](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#variables) with at least `write` access on `error tracking` |
  | `POSTHOG_ENV_ID` | Project ID you can find in your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/environment#variables) |
  | `POSTHOG_HOST` | (optional) Your PostHog instance URL. Defaults to `https://us.i.posthog.com` |

  </div>

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Using CI/CD?" type="action">

Add these environment variables to your CI/CD service's project settings to automatically upload source maps during production builds.

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Verify source map upload and injection">

Confirm source maps were successfully uploaded:

1. Go to your [symbol sets in PostHog](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#error-tracking-symbol-sets) and verify your latest upload appears.

2. Check your production JavaScript files in browser dev tools. They should include a source map reference comment:

```js
//# chunkId=0197e6db-9a73-7b91-9e80-4e1b7158db5c
```

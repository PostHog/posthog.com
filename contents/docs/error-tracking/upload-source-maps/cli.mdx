<Step title="Inject" badge="required">

  Once you've built your application and have bundled assets, inject the context required by PostHog to associate the maps with the served code.

  <CLIInject />

  You can verify that the metadata has been injected by checking for the `//# chunkId=...` comment in the minified code.

</Step>

<Step title="Upload" badge="required">

  You will then need to upload the modified assets to PostHog.

<CLIUpload path="./path/to/assets" />

</Step>

<Step title="Serve injected assets" badge="required">

  You *must* serve the injected assets in deployed production app. The injected metadata is used during error capture to identify the correct source map to use.

  If you serve a copy of the bundled assets as they were prior to running `posthog-cli sourcemap inject`, we won't be able to use the uploaded sourcemap to unminify or demangle your stack traces.

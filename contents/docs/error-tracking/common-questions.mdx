## Exceptions not appearing

If PostHog isn't capturing errors:

1. Run `window.posthog.LIB_VERSION` in your browser console to check your SDK version and update if needed
2. Verify **exception capture** is enabled in [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#exception-autocapture)
3. Only unhandled exceptions auto-capture. For caught errors, use `posthog.captureException()`:

    ```js
    try {
        // code that errors
    } catch (error) {
        posthog.captureException(error)
    }
    ```

4. Wait a few minutes and check the [error tracking in the PostHog app](https://app.posthog.com/error_tracking) before assuming it's broken

You can also use the [SDK doctor](/docs/sdk-doctor) to diagnose common issues.

## Source maps not resolving

If stack traces show minified code instead of original source:

1. Verify source maps are uploaded to the correct project in symbol sets by navigating to [Error tracking](https://app.posthog.com/error_tracking) and selecting **Configure** > **Symbol sets**
2. The `release` tag in your SDK config must match the version you uploaded:

    ```js
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
        ...
        session_recording: {
            recordCrossOriginIframes: true,
        },
        release: 'v1.2.3'
    })
    ```

3. Source map paths must match your production bundle URLs exactly
4. Upload source maps *before* deploying code that references them

See the [source maps guide](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps/) for upload instructions.

## 'Script error' with no stack trace

For security purposes, browsers hide error details from scripts loaded from different domains. This shows as `Script error.` with no stack trace.

To fix, add `crossorigin="anonymous"` to your script tags:

```html
<script src="https://your-cdn.com/app.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

If the script is within your control, also set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Or specify your domain:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourdomain.com
```

It can be difficult to identify which script is causing the error. If you can't fix all scripts immediately, watch [session recordings](/docs/session-replay) to see what actions lead to the error.

## 'Non-Error promise rejection' with no stack trace

This happens when you reject a promise with a string instead of an `Error` object. Without an `Error` object, there's no stack trace to capture.

<MultiLanguage>

```js file=Without stack trace
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject('Something went wrong'); // String has no stack trace
});

Promise.reject('Something went wrong');
```

```js file=With stack trace
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject(new Error('Something went wrong')); // Error includes stack trace
});

Promise.reject(new Error('Something went wrong'));
```

</MultiLanguage>

For third-party libraries that reject with strings, wrap the rejection:

```js
somePromise()
  .catch(err => {
    posthog.captureException(new Error(err))
    throw err
  })
```

## 'Minified React error' with no stack trace

In production builds, React removes debugging information to reduce bundle size. Errors look like:

```
Minified React error #123; visit https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=123
```

To debug:

1. Upload source maps to get readable stack traces. See the [source maps guide](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps/)
2. Visit the error URL in the message to understand what went wrong, though it won't show where in your code the error originated
3. Watch [session recordings](/docs/session-replay) to see what user actions triggered the error, then reproduce in development
4. Use a development build which includes full error messages. Only use this for debugging, not production

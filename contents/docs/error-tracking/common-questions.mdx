## FAQs

### Are web workers supported?

Yes. Error tracking will work as long as you initialize PostHog in the [web worker](/tutorials/web-worker). You will need to disable any features that rely on the `window` object:

```js
posthog.init(token, {
    ...
    autocapture: false,
    capture_pageview: false,
    capture_pageleave: false,
    disable_session_recording: true,
    disable_surveys: true,
});
```

To `identify` users in web workers you will need to pass the distinct ID. This can be done via an env variable or sending it via `postMessage` from your main application.

### Can exceptions be sampled / ignored

Returning `null` for a given event in the [`before_send`](/docs/libraries/js#amending-events-before-they-are-captured) hook will cause it not to be captured. You may want to:
- Drop certain types of exceptions
- Randomly sample a subset of all exceptions 
- Sample based on the events properties (e.g. URL or user)

## FAQs

### How much does error tracking cost?

Your first 100,000 `$exception` events each month are free – i.e. if you never exceed this number, you can use error tracking for free.

After this, we charge a small amount for each `$exception` event you send. The more events you send, the less each event costs.

Go to the [pricing page](/pricing) to use our calculator to get an estimate. You can also view an estimate on [your billing page](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing).

### Are web workers supported?

Yes. Error tracking will work as long as you initialize PostHog in the [web worker](/tutorials/web-worker). You will need to disable any features that rely on the `window` object:

```js
posthog.init(token, {
    ...
    autocapture: false,
    capture_pageview: false,
    capture_pageleave: false,
    disable_session_recording: true,
    disable_surveys: true,
});
```

To `identify` users in web workers you will need to pass the distinct ID. This can be done via an env variable or sending it via `postMessage` from your main application.

### Can exceptions be sampled / ignored

Returning `null` for a given event in the [`before_send`](/docs/libraries/js/features#amending-or-sampling-events) hook will cause it not to be captured. You may want to:
- Drop certain types of exceptions
- Randomly sample a subset of all exceptions 
- Sample based on the events properties (e.g. URL or user)

## Troubleshooting

### What is a 'Script error.' with no stack traces?

For security purposes, errors sent from a JavaScript file served on a different domain hide the original error to avoid unintentionally leaking sensitive information to any `onerror` handler. This is often the case for third party scripts running on a site and results in an obfuscated 'Script error.' with no associated stack trace.

To see the actual error, the erroring script needs to be loaded `anonymously` which excludes potentially user-identifying information such as cookies from being transmitted when requesting the file.

```
<script src="https://third-party.domain/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

It can be somewhat difficult to know which script is causing the error because the captured exception provides no context. There is no solution to this other than to work through a process of elimination.

If the script is within your control, you also need to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header to include the calling domain. This can be a comma separated list of valid domains or a global wildcard e.g `*`.

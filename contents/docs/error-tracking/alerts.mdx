title: Send error tracking alerts
---

To stay on top of issues, you can set up alerts. These enable you to post to Slack, Discord, Teams, or an HTTP Webhook when an issue is created or reopened.

## Issue created or reopened

To alert when an issue is created or reopened, go to [error tracking's configuration page](https://us.posthog.com/error_tracking/configuration) and click **Alerting**. This shows you a list of existing alerts. Clicking **New notification** brings you to a page to create a new one.

Choosing an option brings you to a page to configure the alert. This may require setting up the Slack integration or pasting in a webhook URL. Once done, you can test the alert by clicking **Test function** and then finalize by clicking **Create & enable**.

This will then send alerts to your chosen destination when an issue is created or reopened like this:

## Issue properties and assignments

You can filter an alert based on the properties of an issue. This is useful for notifying a specific team when they have been auto assigned an issue using [auto assignment rules](/docs/error-tracking/managing-issues#auto-assignment-rules).

## Other alerting options

Since error tracking works by capturing `$exception` events, PostHog features that trigger by events can play a role in alerts too.

### Real time destinations

The first way is using [real time destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations). This enables you to send events (like `$exception`) to other tools as soon as they are ingested.

To create a real time destination, go to the [data pipelines tab](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/overview) in PostHog, click **+ New**, and then select **Destination**. Choose your destination and press **+ Create**.

On the destination creation screen, make sure to add an event matcher for the `$exception` event, filter for the properties you want, and set the trigger options.

Check out our [real time destinations docs](/docs/cdp/destinations) for more information.

### Trend alerts

You can also visualize your `$exception` events using [trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends/overview). Once you create a trend insight, click the **Alerts** button at the top of the insight and then **New alert**. 

Here you can set alerts for event volume value, increase, or decrease.

title: Error tracking alerts
---

To stay on top of issues, you can set up alerts. These enable you to post to Slack, Discord, Teams, or an HTTP Webhook when an issue is created or reopened.

To create an issue alert, go to [error tracking's configuration page](https://us.posthog.com/error_tracking/configuration) and click **Alerting**. This shows you a list of existing alerts. Clicking **New notification** brings you to a page to create a new one.

Choosing an option brings you to a page to configure the alert. This may require setting up the Slack integration or pasting in a webhook URL. Once done, you can test the alert by clicking **Test function** and then finalize by clicking **Create & enable**.

This will then send alerts to your chosen destination when an issue is created or reopened like this:

## Other alerting options

Since error tracking works by capturing `$exception` events, we can use other features of PostHog to alert you using these events.

### Real time destinations

The first way is using [real time destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations). This enables you to send events (like `$exception`) to other tools as soon as they are ingested.

To create a real time destination, go to the [data pipeline tab](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/overview) in PostHog, click **+ New**, and then select **Destination**. Choose your destination and press **+ Create**.

On the destination creation screen, make sure to add an event matcher for the `$exception` event, filter for the properties you want, and set the trigger options.

Check out our [real time destinations docs](/docs/cdp/destinations) for more information.

### Trend alerts

You can also visualize your `$exception` events using [trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends/overview). Once you create a trend insight, click the **Alerts** button at the top of the insight and then **New alert**. 

Here you can set alerts for event volume value, increase, or decrease.

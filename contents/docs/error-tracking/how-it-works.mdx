  PostHog's error tracking lets you monitor, investigate, and resolve any issues your users encounter within your app, so you can ship with confidence and debug faster.


  The first step is to install the PostHog SDK to start capturing exception events within your application.

  ### Platforms

  <InstallationPlatforms />

  ### Auto and manual capture

  Exception autocapture can be enabled for most platforms. When enabled, PostHog automatically captures `$exception` events whenever errors are thrown by the client or server application.

  You can also call the capture method `posthog.captureException()` to manually send exceptions to PostHog with custom properties.

  The second step is to upload source maps to get accurate, readable stack traces for your captured exceptions. This helps you quickly identify and debug issues by showing you the original code context where the error occurred.

  Once you're capturing errors, the next step is to stay on top of issues. Exception events are grouped into issues for your team to manage based on event information, such as the exception type, message, and stack trace.

  Use the PostHog error tracking dashboard to: 
  
  - Manage, resolve, and auto-assign issues to team members
  - Customize issue grouping with rules 
  - Set up real-time alerts based on event triggers, filters, and trends
  - Integrate with Slack, Discord, Teams, or an HTTP webhook

  Take advantage of PostHog's [customer infrastructure](/docs) features to help you move from application errors to product improvements.

  ### Session replay

  See exactly what users did before and after the error with [session replays](/docs/session-replay).

    autoPlay="true"

  />

  ### Product analytics

  Use `$exception` events with [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics) to create trends, funnels, or retention [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) to spot patterns and prioritize issues. You can also see exceptions by individual users in their event history log.

  ### Feature flags

  Roll out or revert code updates with [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) based on users whoâ€™ve hit specific exceptions.

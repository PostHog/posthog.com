<Step title="Install PostHog Android SDK" badge="required">

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of [3.24.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/releases/tag/android-v3.24.0) is required, but we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

<Step title="Set up exception autocapture" badge="required">

> **Note:** This configuration is client-side only. We'll add support for the [Error tracking remote config](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#exception-autocapture) later.

You can autocapture exceptions by setting the `errorTrackingConfig.autoCapture` argument to `true` when initializing the PostHog SDK.

```kotlin
import com.posthog.android.PostHogAndroidConfig

val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(apiKey = POSTHOG_API_KEY, host = POSTHOG_HOST).apply {
    ...
    errorTrackingConfig.autoCapture = true
}
...
```

When enabled, this automatically captures `$exception` events when errors are thrown by wrapping the `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler` listener.

</Step>

<Step title="Manually capture exceptions" badge="optional">

It is also possible to manually capture exceptions using the `captureException` method:

```kotlin
PostHog.captureException(exception, properties = additionalProperties)
```

This is helpful if you've built your own error handling logic or want to capture exceptions that are handled by your application code.

</Step>

> **Note:** We currently don't support [source code context](/docs/error-tracking/stack-traces) associated with an exception. We'll add support for it later.

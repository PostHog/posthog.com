<Step title="Install PostHog web SDK" badge="required">

### Option 1: Add the JavaScript snippet to your HTML <span class="bg-gray-accent-light dark:bg-gray-accent-dark text-gray font-semibold align-middle text-sm p-1 rounded">Recommended</span>

<Snippet />

### Option 2: Install via package manager

Start by installing PostHog with the package manager of your choice:

<InstallWebPackageManagers />

And then include it with your project API key and host (which you can find in [your project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project)):
```js-web
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>'
})
```

See our framework specific docs for [Next.js](/docs/libraries/next-js), [React](/docs/libraries/react), [Vue](/docs/libraries/vue-js), [Angular](/docs/libraries/angular), [Astro](/docs/libraries/astro), [Remix](/docs/libraries/remix), and [Svelte](/docs/libraries/svelte) for more installation details.

<details>
<summary>Bundle all required extensions (advanced)</summary>

By default, the JavaScript Web library only loads the core functionality. It lazy-loads extensions such as surveys or the session replay 'recorder' when needed. 

This can cause issues if:

- You have a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline scripts. 
- You want to optimize your bundle at build time to ensure all dependencies are ready immediately.
- Your app is running in environments like the Chrome Extension store or [Electron](/tutorials/electron-analytics) that reject or block remote code loading.

To solve these issues, we have multiple import options available below.

**Note:** With any of the `no-external` options, the toolbar will be unavailable as this is only possible as a runtime dependency loaded directly from `app.posthog.com`.

```js-web
// No external code loading possible (this disables all extensions such as Replay, Surveys, Exceptions etc.)
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.no-external'

// No external code loading possible but all external dependencies pre-bundled
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.full.no-external'

// All external dependencies pre-bundled and with the ability to load external scripts (primarily useful is you use Site Apps)
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.full'

// Finally you can also import specific extra dependencies 
import "posthog-js/dist/recorder"
import "posthog-js/dist/surveys"
import "posthog-js/dist/exception-autocapture"
import "posthog-js/dist/tracing-headers"
import "posthog-js/dist/web-vitals"
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.no-external'

// All other posthog commands are the same as usual
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>', defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>' })
```

**Note:** You should ensure if using this option that you always import `posthog-js` from the same module, otherwise multiple bundles could get included. At this time `posthog-js/react` does not work with any module import other than the default.

<summary>Don't want to send test data while developing?</summary>

If you don't want to send test data while you're developing, you can do the following:

```js-web
if (!window.location.host.includes('127.0.0.1') && !window.location.host.includes('localhost')) {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>', defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>' })
}
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the `defaults` option?</summary>

The `defaults` is a date, such as `2025-05-24`, for a configuration snapshot used as defaults to initialize PostHog. This default is overridden when you explicitly set a value for any of the options.

<Step title="Set up exception autocapture" badge="recommended">

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of v1.207.8 is required, but we recommend [keeping up to date with the latest version](/docs/sdk-doctor) to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

You can enable exception autocapture for the JavaScript Web SDK in the **Error tracking** section of [your project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#exception-autocapture). 

When enabled, this automatically captures `$exception` events when errors are thrown by wrapping the `window.onerror` and `window.onunhandledrejection` listeners.

</Step>

<Step title="Manually capture exceptions" badge="optional">

It is also possible to manually capture exceptions using the `captureException` method:

```js
posthog.captureException(error, additionalProperties)
```

This is helpful if you've built your own error handling logic or want to capture exceptions that are handled by your application code.

**NO IMPORT:**

### Option 1: Add the JavaScript snippet to your HTML <span class="bg-gray-accent-light dark:bg-gray-accent-dark text-gray font-semibold align-middle text-sm p-1 rounded">Recommended</span>

<JsSnippet />

### Option 2: Install via package manager

<InstallWebPackageManagers />

And then include it with your project API key and host (which you can find in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project)):

```js-web
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>'
})
```

See our framework specific docs for [Next.js](/docs/libraries/next-js), [React](/docs/libraries/react), [Vue](/docs/libraries/vue-js), [Angular](/docs/libraries/angular), [Astro](/docs/libraries/astro), [Remix](/docs/libraries/remix), and [Svelte](/docs/libraries/svelte) for more installation details.

<summary>Bundle all required extensions (advanced)</summary>

By default, the JavaScript Web library only loads the core functionality. It lazy-loads extensions such as surveys or the session replay 'recorder' when needed. 

This can cause issues if:

- You have a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline scripts. 
- You want to optimize your bundle at build time to ensure all dependencies are ready immediately.
- Your app is running in environments like the Chrome Extension store or [Electron](/tutorials/electron-analytics) that reject or block remote code loading.

To solve these issues, we have multiple import options available below.

**Note:** With any of the `no-external` options, the toolbar will be unavailable as this is only possible as a runtime dependency loaded directly from `us.posthog.com`.

```js-web
// No external code loading possible (this disables all extensions such as Replay, Surveys, Exceptions etc.)
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.no-external'

// No external code loading possible but all external dependencies pre-bundled
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.full.no-external'

// All external dependencies pre-bundled and with the ability to load external scripts (primarily useful is you use Site Apps)
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.full'

// Finally you can also import specific extra dependencies 
import "posthog-js/dist/recorder"
import "posthog-js/dist/surveys"
import "posthog-js/dist/exception-autocapture"
import "posthog-js/dist/tracing-headers"
import "posthog-js/dist/web-vitals"
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.no-external'

// All other posthog commands are the same as usual
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>', defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>' })
```

**Note:** You should ensure if using this option that you always import `posthog-js` from the same module, otherwise multiple bundles could get included. At this time `posthog-js/react` does not work with any module import other than the default.

<summary>Don't want to send test data while developing?</summary>

If you don't want to send test data while you're developing, you can do the following:

```js-web
if (!window.location.host.includes('127.0.0.1') && !window.location.host.includes('localhost')) {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>', defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>' })
}
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the `defaults` option?</summary>

The `defaults` is a date, such as `2025-05-24`, for a configuration snapshot used as defaults to initialize PostHog. This default is overridden when you explicitly set a value for any of the options.

**✅ Checkpoint** – Before proceeding, confirm that:

1. You can [manually capture](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events) events in client-side code (components using `'use client'`).
2. If [autocapture is enabled](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#disabling-autocapture), you should see basic events like clicks and page views.

<div className="mt-4 mb-2">
    <CallToAction type="primary" to="https://us.posthog.com/activity/explore">
        Check for events in PostHog
    </CallToAction>
</div>

</Step>

<Step title="Capturing exceptions" subtitle="Your goal in this step: Enable automatic exception tracking for your web application." badge="required">

**NO IMPORT:**

### Setting up exception autocapture

> **Note:** A minimum SDK version of v1.207.8 is required, but we recommend keeping up to date with the latest version to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

You can enable exception autocapture for the JavaScript Web SDK in the **Error tracking** section of [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-error-tracking#exception-autocapture). 

When enabled, this automatically captures `$exception` events when errors are thrown by wrapping the `window.onerror` and `window.onunhandledrejection` listeners.

#### Manual error capture

It is also possible to manually capture exceptions using the `captureException` method:

```js
posthog.captureException(error, additionalProperties)
```

--- 

**✅ Checkpoint** – Before proceeding, confirm that exceptions are being captured in PostHog.

<div className="mt-4 mb-2">
    <CallToAction type="primary" to="https://us.posthog.com/activity/explore">
        Check for exceptions in PostHog
    </CallToAction>
</div>

</Step>

<Step title="Next steps">

**NO IMPORT:**

After configuring PostHog, you will start receiving exceptions in PostHog. To help you get more out of your error tracking, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Upload source maps](/docs/error-tracking/upload-source-maps) | Required for accurate stack traces if you serve minified bundles. |
| [Configure alerting](/docs/error-tracking/alerting) | Get notified when errors occur |
| [Cutting cost](/docs/error-tracking/cost-optimization) | Take advantage of our cost-effective pricing |

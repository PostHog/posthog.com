<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="SDK version requirement" type="action">

A minimum SDK version of [2.0.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/releases/tag/server-v2.0.0) is required, but we recommend [keeping up to date with the latest version](/docs/sdk-doctor) to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

<Step title="Manually capturing exceptions" subtitle="Your goal in this step: Manually capture exceptions in your Java application." badge="optional">

To send errors manually, use the `captureException` method like this:

```java
try {
    // Your code that might throw an exception
    throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong");
} catch (Exception e) {
    posthog.captureException(
        e,
        "distinct_id_of_your_user", // TIP: This will associate the exception with a user. It can also be null!
        Map.of(
            "service", "payment-processor",
            "context", "checkout_flow"
        )
    );
}
```

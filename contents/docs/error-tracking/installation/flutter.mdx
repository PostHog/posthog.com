<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Planned features" type="fyi">

We currently don't support the following features:

- Automatic exception capture
- De-obfuscating stacktraces from obfuscated builds ([--obfuscate](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/obfuscate) and [--split-debug-info](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/obfuscate))
- [Source code context](/docs/error-tracking/stack-traces) associated with an exception
- Flutter web support

These features will be added in future releases.

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="SDK version requirement" type="action">

A minimum SDK version of [5.7.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-flutter/releases/tag/5.7.0) is required, but we recommend [keeping up to date with the latest version](/docs/sdk-doctor) to ensure you have all of error tracking's features.

<Step title="Manually capture exceptions" badge="optional">

### Basic usage

You can manually capture exceptions using the `captureException` method:

```dart
try {
  // Your awesome code that may throw
  await someRiskyOperation();
} catch (exception, stackTrace) {
  // Capture the exception with PostHog
  await Posthog().captureException(
    error: exception,
    stackTrace: stackTrace,
    properties: {
      'user_action': 'button_press',
      'feature_name': 'data_sync',
    },
  );
}
```

This is helpful if you've built your own error handling logic or want to capture exceptions that are handled by your application code.

### Error tracking configuration

You can configure error tracking behavior when setting up PostHog:

```dart
final config = PostHogConfig('<ph_project_api_key>');

// Configure error tracking
config.errorTrackingConfig.inAppIncludes = ['package:your_app'];
config.errorTrackingConfig.inAppExcludes = ['package:third_party_lib'];
config.errorTrackingConfig.inAppByDefault = true;

await Posthog().setup(config);
```

**Configuration options:**

- **`inAppIncludes`**: List of package names to be considered inApp frames (takes precedence over excludes)
- **`inAppExcludes`**: List of package names to be excluded from inApp frames  
- **`inAppByDefault`**: Whether frames are considered inApp by default when their origin cannot be determined

`inApp` frames are stack trace frames that belong to your application code (as opposed to third-party libraries or system code). 
These are highlighted in the PostHog error tracking interface to help you focus on the relevant parts of the stack trace.

**✅ Checkpoint** – Before proceeding, confirm that:

1. You can [manually capture](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events) events in client-side code (components using `'use client'`).
2. If [autocapture is enabled](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#disabling-autocapture), you should see basic events like clicks and page views.

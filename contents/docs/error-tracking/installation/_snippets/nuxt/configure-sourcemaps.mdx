PostHog requires sourcemaps to be generated during build to properly display stack traces. We can do this by running the `posthog-cli` to inject and upload sourcemaps post-build using the `close` hook.  

#### 1. Download CLI

<CLIDownload />

#### 2. Authenticate

<CLIAuthenticate />

#### 3. Generate sourcemaps during build

```js file=nuxt.config.js
import { execSync } from 'child_process' // +

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ...,
  sourcemap: {
    client: true // +
  },
  hooks: {
    'close': async () => {
      console.log('Running PostHog sourcemap injection and upload...')
      try {
        execSync("posthog-cli sourcemap inject --directory '.output'", { // +
          stdio: 'inherit', // +
        }) // +
        execSync("posthog-cli sourcemap upload --directory '.output'", { // +
          stdio: 'inherit', // +
        }) // + 
        console.log('PostHog sourcemap injection completed successfully') 
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('PostHog sourcemap injection failed:', error)
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### 4. Build your project for production

Build your project for production by running the following command:

```bash
nuxt build
```

You can verify the injection is successful by checking your `.mjs.map` source map files for `//# chunkId=` comments. Make sure to serve these injected files in production, PostHog will check for the `//# chunkId` comments to display the correct stack traces.

<EndpointsBetaSnippet />

The [**Usage** tab](https://us.posthog.com/endpoints/usage) shows endpoint performance and costs. Metrics are filtered to personal API key requests only, so you see actual endpoint usage rather than all API activity.

## Usage metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total requests | Total number of endpoint executions |
| Bytes read | Sum of bytes read from storage |
| CPU seconds | Sum of CPU time consumed |
| Avg query duration | Average query execution time |
| P95 query duration | 95th percentile query execution time |
| Error rate | Percentage of failed executions |
| Materialized requests | Count of executions using materialized data |
| Inline requests | Count of executions running queries directly |

Each metric shows the percentage change compared to the previous period.

## Filtering

Filter by specific endpoints, date range, or materialization type (materialized vs inline).

## Trends

The trends view shows how metrics change over time. Track requests, bytes read, CPU seconds, query duration, or error rate. Use **Breakdown** to compare across different dimensions.

## Optimizing costs

Use the Usage tab to spot optimization opportunities:

- **High bytes read** – [Materialize](/docs/endpoints/configuration#materialization) frequently-accessed endpoints to reduce data scans
- **High CPU seconds** – Review and optimize the underlying queries
- **Many inline requests** – Materialize endpoints that are called frequently
- **High error rates** – Investigate and fix failing endpoints

See [writing performant queries](/docs/api/queries#writing-performant-queries) for more tips.

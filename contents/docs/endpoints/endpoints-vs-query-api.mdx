title: Endpoints vs Query API
---




PostHog offers two ways to run queries programmatically: the [Query API](/docs/api/queries) and Endpoints. Here's how they differ and when to use each.

## Query API

The Query API is a free-form API that lets you run any query. While flexible, it has some drawbacks:

- **Noisy neighbor problem** - Query API requests compete with all other PostHog load. If one customer runs many complex queries, performance degrades for everyone.
- **Harder to monitor** - Tracking query performance over time requires querying the `system.query_log` table manually.
- **Future pricing** - We strongly discourage Query API usage and will eventually charge for it.

## Endpoints

Endpoints provide a more stable, purpose-built solution for production use cases:

- **Isolated compute** - Materialized endpoints run on separate compute, avoiding the noisy neighbor problem and enabling better rate/concurrency limits.
- **Easy monitoring** - The [`Usage` tab](/docs/endpoints/usage-analytics) shows performance metrics out of the box.
- **Developer experience** - First-class features like [versioning](/docs/endpoints/versioning), [OpenAPI specs](/docs/endpoints/openapi-sdk-generation), and easy configuration.
- **Cost and speed controls** - [Materialization](/docs/endpoints/materialization) and [caching](/docs/endpoints/caching) let you trade data freshness for performance.
- **Abuse prevention** - Individual endpoints can be disabled if needed.

## When to use each

| Use case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Ad-hoc and explorative queries | Query API |
| Production application | Endpoints |
| Customer-facing analytics | Endpoints |
| High traffic | Endpoints |
| Data exports to a third-party (i.e. S3 or Snowflake) | [Batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) |

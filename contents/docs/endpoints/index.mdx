<EndpointsBetaSnippet />

Endpoints let you expose your PostHog [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) and [SQL queries](/docs/sql) as API endpoints. Instead of rebuilding complex queries in your application code, create an endpoint that returns the exact data you need.

## Why use endpoints?

- Embed analytics in your product – show PostHog data to your customers without exposing your entire analytics setup
- Your endpoint URLs stay the same even when you update the underlying query
- Endpoints use isolated resources and support materialization for faster responses
- Call a single API instead of managing query construction in your app

## How it works

1. Create an insight or write a SQL query that returns the data you need
2. Convert it to an endpoint with a descriptive name
3. Call the endpoint from your application using your [personal API key](/docs/api/overview#personal-api-keys)

The endpoint returns your query results in a consistent format, ready to use in your application.

## Key features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Versioning** | Track changes to your endpoints and test older versions |
| **Materialization** | Precompute results on a schedule for faster responses |
| **Caching** | Configure how long results should be cached |
| **Authentication** | Secure access with personal API keys |

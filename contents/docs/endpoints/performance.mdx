<EndpointsBetaSnippet />

Endpoint performance depends on the underlying queries. For faster responses:

- **Use shorter date ranges** – Only query the time periods you need
- **Avoid scanning the same table multiple times** – Restructure queries to reduce redundant scans
- **Use materialized views** – Precompute frequently accessed data. You can also [materialize your endpoint](/docs/endpoints/configuration#materialization) directly.
- **Add appropriate filters** – Limit the data processed

See [writing performant queries](/docs/api/queries#writing-performant-queries) for more details.

## Isolated resources

Unlike the standard Query API, endpoints use isolated resources. This means more consistent, reliable performance for production use cases.

## Rate limits

Endpoints have separate rate limits from the Query API. Materialized endpoints get 5x higher limits since they return precomputed results instead of querying ClickHouse.

| Endpoint type | Burst rate | Sustained rate |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Inline (non-materialized) | 240 requests/minute | 2,400 requests/hour |
| Materialized | 1,200 requests/minute | 12,000 requests/hour |

If you're hitting rate limits frequently, consider [enabling materialization](/docs/endpoints/configuration#materialization) for your busiest endpoints.

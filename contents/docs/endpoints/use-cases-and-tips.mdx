## Common use cases

### Customer-facing dashboards

If you need to show a subset of your analytics to your own customers, endpoints provide a secure, performant way to do this.

**Example**: Create an endpoint from a "Daily Active Users" insight and display it in your customer dashboard.

### Predefined queries

For queries you run frequently, endpoints provide a stable, optimized way to programmatically access the data without reconstructing the query each time.

**Example**: Create an endpoint for "Top 10 events this week" that your team can call regularly.

## Performance tips

### Use materialization

For better performance, consider materializing your endpoints query. Materialized queries are precomputed, which can significantly improve endpoint response times.

### Cache responses

Endpoints return cached data when available. You can configure the TTL of cached results based on your requirements. If the cache is older than your desired freshness, the endpoint will execute the query again. Endpoints should eliminate the need for you to implement your own caching layer.

### Optimize your queries

The performance of your endpoints depends on the underlying queries. Follow best practices for [writing performant queries](/docs/api/queries#writing-performant-queries):

- Use shorter time ranges
- Avoid scanning the same table multiple times
- Use materialized views for frequently accessed data
- Include appropriate filters to limit data scanned

## Isolated Resources

Endpoints make use of isolated resources unlike our standard Query API, making them suitable for production use cases. Check the [API reference](/docs/api/endpoints) for current information.

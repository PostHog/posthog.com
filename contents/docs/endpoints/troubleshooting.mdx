## Endpoint not found (404)

- Verify the endpoint name is correct
- Check that the endpoint is **active** - inactive endpoints return 404
- Ensure you're using the correct project ID

## Authentication errors (401/403)

- Verify your personal API key is correct
- Check that your API key has the `endpoint:read` scope
- Ensure you're including the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header

## Version not found

If you get `"Version X not found for endpoint"`:
- Check available versions in the endpoint's UI
- Omit the `version` parameter to use the latest version

## Variable errors

**"Variable 'X' is not allowed for this endpoint"**
- Check the [variables documentation](/docs/endpoints/variables) for which variables are supported
- SQL endpoints only accept variables explicitly defined in the query
- Insight endpoints accept the breakdown property name and `date_from`/`date_to` (non-materialized only)

> **Note:** `filters_override` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use `variables` instead. See the [variables documentation](/docs/endpoints/variables) for migration guidance.

## Rate limiting (429)

**"Too many concurrent requests. Please try again later."**
- You've hit the concurrency limit
- Reduce parallel requests or wait before retrying

## Materialization errors

**"Cannot materialize endpoint: ..."**
- The endpoint has variables (not supported with materialization)
- The endpoint is inactive

**"Cannot enable materialization on inactive endpoint"**
- Activate the endpoint first, then enable materialization

## Column type errors

**"There's no column... in table. Note: While in beta, not all column types may be fully supported"**
- Some column types aren't fully supported yet
- Try simplifying your query or casting columns to supported types

## Slow responses

If endpoints are slow:
- Look at the [endpoints usage tab](https://app.posthog.com/endpoints/usage) with the filter for the slow endpoint
- Check if the underlying query is optimized
- Consider materializing your endpoint
- Review the query performance in the query log

## Endpoint not found

If you get a 404 error:
- Verify the endpoint name is correct
- Check that the endpoint exists in your team
- Ensure you're using the correct team ID

## Authentication errors

If you get authentication errors:
- Verify your personal API key is correct
- Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
- Ensure you're including the `Authorization` header in your requests

## Slow responses

If endpoints are slow:
- Look at the Usage tab of the Endpoints product with the filter for the slow endpoint
- Check if the underlying query is optimized
- Consider materializing your endpoint
- Review the query performance in the query log

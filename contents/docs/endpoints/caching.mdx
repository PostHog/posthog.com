title: Caching
---




Caching stores query results temporarily so repeated calls don't re-run the query. This is different from [materialization](/docs/endpoints/materialization), which pre-computes and stores results on a schedule.

## How caching works

When you execute an endpoint:

1. PostHog checks if there's a cached result that's still considered fresh based on your configuration
2. If yes, it returns the cached result immediately
3. If no, it runs the query and caches the result

## Cache age

You can set a custom cache duration per endpoint in the `Configuration` tab. The allowed range is:

- **Minimum:** 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Maximum:** 24 hours (86,400 seconds)

If not set, the default is 6 hours.

See [endpoint execution](/docs/endpoints/execution) for more detail on how this can affect your results.

## Caching vs materialization

| Feature | Caching | Materialization |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Storage | Temporary | Persistent (S3) |
| Refresh | On demand | Scheduled |
| Best for | Moderate traffic, real-time needs | High traffic, expensive queries |

Use caching when you need relatively fresh data. Use materialization when query speed matters more than freshness.

## Customer-facing dashboards

If you need to show a subset of your analytics to your own customers, endpoints provide a secure, performant way to do this.

**Example**: Create an endpoint from a "Daily Active Users" insight and display it in your customer dashboard.

## Predefined queries

For queries you run frequently, endpoints provide a stable, optimized way to programmatically access the data without reconstructing the query each time.

**Example**: Create an endpoint for "Top 10 events this week" that your team can call regularly.

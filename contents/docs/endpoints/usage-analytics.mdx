The `Usage` tab on the Endpoints page helps you monitor how your endpoints are being used and spot performance issues.

## What you can see

- **Overview cards** - Total executions, bytes read, CPU time, average and P95 duration, error rate, and a split between materialized vs direct executions
- **Trend charts** - Executions, error rate, query duration, CPU time, and bytes read over time
- **Breakdown table** - Per-endpoint stats including executions, bytes read, CPU time, and error rate

## Filtering and breakdowns

You can filter by date range, specific endpoints, and execution type (materialized vs direct).

Use the breakdown options to slice the data by:
- **Endpoint** - Compare usage across different endpoints
- **API key** - See which keys are driving the most usage
- **Execution type** - Understand the split between materialized and direct executions

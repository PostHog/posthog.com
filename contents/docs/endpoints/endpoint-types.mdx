title: Endpoint types
---




Endpoints can be created from two types of sources: **insights** or **SQL queries**. Each has different strengths and use cases.

## Insight-based endpoints

Insight-based endpoints are created from existing PostHog insights. They're ideal when you want to expose data from an insight you've already built in the UI.

**Supported insight types:**
- Trends
- Funnels
- Retention
- Lifecycle
- Paths
- Stickiness

**Pros:**
- Easy to create from existing insights
- Visual query builder - no SQL required
- Automatic [magic variables](/docs/endpoints/variables#variables-in-insight-based-endpoints) for breakdowns and date filtering

**Cons:**
- Less flexible than SQL
- Limited to what the insight UI supports

### Example use cases

- Expose a trends chart showing daily active users per customer
- Share funnel conversion rates with your customers
- Provide retention data for customer health dashboards

## SQL-based endpoints

SQL-based endpoints are created from SQL queries written in the [SQL editor](https://us.posthog.com/sql). They give you full control over the query and output format.

**Pros:**
- Full SQL flexibility
- Custom output shapes
- Explicit [variables](/docs/endpoints/variables#variables-in-SQL-based-endpoints) with precise control
- Can query any table in PostHog

**Cons:**
- Requires SQL knowledge

### Example use cases

- Custom aggregations not available in insights
- Joining data across multiple tables
- Complex filtering logic
- Custom output formats for specific integrations

## Choosing the right type

| Use case | Recommended type |
|----------|-----------------|
| Already have an insight you want to expose | Insight-based |
| Need a simple trends/funnel/retention query | Insight-based |
| Need custom SQL or complex joins | SQL-based |
| Want precise control over output format | SQL-based |
| Need multiple explicit variables | SQL-based |

## Variables

Both endpoint types support variables for runtime customization, but they work differently:

- **Insight-based**: Use [magic variables](/docs/endpoints/variables#variables-in-insight-based-endpoints) - the breakdown property and date filters are automatically available
- **SQL-based**: Define [explicit variables](/docs/endpoints/variables#variables-in-SQL-based-endpoints) in your query using `{variables.name}` syntax

See the [variables documentation](/docs/endpoints/variables) for details.

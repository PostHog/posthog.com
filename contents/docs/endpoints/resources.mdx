Additional resources and guides for working with endpoints.

## Common use cases

### Customer-facing dashboards

If you need to show a subset of your analytics to your own customers, endpoints provide a secure, performant way to do this.

**Example**: Create an endpoint from a "Daily Active Users" Insight and display it in your customer dashboard.

### Predefined queries

For queries you run frequently, endpoints provide a stable, optimized way to access the data without reconstructing the query each time.

**Example**: Create an endpoint for "Top 10 events this week" that your team can call regularly.

## Performance tips

### Use materialized views

For better performance, consider creating [materialized views](/docs/data-warehouse/views/materialize) for the data your endpoints query. Materialized views are precomputed, which can significantly improve endpoint response times.

### Cache responses

Endpoints return cached data when available. You can configure the TTL of cached results based on your requirements. If the cache is older than your desired freshness, the endpoint will execute the query again. Endpoints should eliminate the need for you to implement your own caching layer.

### Optimize your queries

The performance of your endpoints depends on the underlying queries. Follow best practices for [writing performant queries](/docs/api/queries#writing-performant-queries):

- Use shorter time ranges
- Avoid scanning the same table multiple times
- Use materialized views for frequently accessed data
- Include appropriate filters to limit data scanned

## Rate limits

Endpoints have higher rate limits than standard API queries, making them suitable for production use cases. Check the [API reference](/docs/api/endpoints) for current rate limit information.

## Security

- **Authentication**: All endpoint requests require authentication with a personal API key
- **Permissions**: Ensure your API keys have the appropriate permissions for the data you're accessing
- **Team isolation**: Endpoints are scoped to your team, so you can only access endpoints in your own team

## Troubleshooting

### Endpoint not found

If you get a 404 error:
- Verify the endpoint name is correct
- Check that the endpoint exists in your team
- Ensure you're using the correct team ID

### Authentication errors

If you get authentication errors:
- Verify your personal API key is correct
- Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
- Ensure you're including the `Authorization` header in your requests

### Slow responses

If endpoints are slow:
- Check if the underlying query is optimized
- Consider using materialized views
- Review the query performance in the query log

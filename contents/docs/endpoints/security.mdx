<EndpointsBetaSnippet />

All endpoint requests require a [personal API key](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) with the `endpoint:read` scope. Endpoints are scoped to your project, so you can only access endpoints within your own project.

To set up authentication:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Personal API keys**
2. Create a new API key with the `endpoint:read` scope
3. Include the key in your requests using the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header

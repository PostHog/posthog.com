title: Rate limits
---




Endpoints can provide better rate limits than other APIs depending on how they're configured.

## Direct execution

Endpoints running with direct execution (no materialization) have the same rate limits as the standard [API rate limits](/docs/api#rate-limiting).

## Materialized endpoints

Materialized endpoints have higher limits because their execution goes through a different compute path:

- **Burst**: 1,200 requests/minute
- **Sustained**: 12,000 requests/hour
- **Concurrency**: 10 concurrent requests 

## Need higher limits?

If you need higher rate and concurrency limits, [materialize your endpoints](/docs/endpoints/materialization).
If that's still not enough, [talk to a human](/talk-to-a-human).

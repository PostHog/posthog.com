Endpoints is free during beta. The pricing structure below reflects our current thinking, but may change before general availability. We'll notify all beta users before any pricing goes into effect.

## Understanding endpoint pricing

Endpoints pricing will be based on two factors:

- **Compute usage**: CPU time spent executing queries
- **Data scanned**: Amount of data read from storage

Both non-materialized and materialized endpoints consume these resources, but in different ways.

## Optimizing query performance

The most effective way to reduce costs is to write efficient queries:

- **Filter early**: Add WHERE clauses to limit data scanned
- **Use appropriate date ranges**: Avoid scanning more historical data than needed
- **Select only needed columns**: Don't use `SELECT *` if you only need specific fields

## Using materialization effectively

[Materialization](/docs/endpoints/materialization) pre-computes query results, which can significantly reduce per-request costs for frequently accessed endpoints.

### When materialization saves money

Materialization is cost-effective when:
- The endpoint is called frequently (many reads per sync)
- The underlying query is expensive (scans lots of data)
- Data freshness requirements allow for periodic syncs

### When materialization adds cost

Materialization may increase costs when:
- The endpoint is rarely called
- The query is already fast and cheap
- You need real-time data

### Sync frequency trade-offs

Choose a sync frequency that balances freshness with cost:

| Frequency | Best for |
|-----------|----------|
| Hourly | High-traffic endpoints where near-real-time matters |
| Daily | Most customer-facing dashboards |
| Weekly | Historical reports, slowly-changing data |

## Caching strategies

Endpoints support [caching](/docs/endpoints/caching) to reduce redundant query execution.

### Setting appropriate cache duration

- **5-15 minutes**: Data that changes frequently but doesn't need to be real-time
- **1-6 hours**: Dashboards and reports viewed periodically
- **24 hours**: Historical data or slowly-changing metrics

Longer cache durations reduce costs but show less fresh data.

## Monitoring usage

Track your endpoint usage to identify optimization opportunities:

1. Use the [endpoints usage page](https://app.posthog.com/endpoints/usage) to see request volumes
2. Identify your most-called endpoints
3. Look for endpoints with high compute time per request
4. Consider materializing high-volume, expensive endpoints

## Deactivating unused endpoints

Inactive endpoints don't consume resources, but materialized endpoints and endpoint versions with active syncs do. Review your endpoints periodically and:

- Deactivate endpoints and endpoint versions no longer in use
- Disable materialization on endpoints that don't benefit from it
- Delete endpoints that are no longer needed

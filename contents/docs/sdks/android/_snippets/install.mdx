The best way to install the PostHog Android library is with a build system like 
Gradle. This ensures you can easily upgrade to the latest versions. 

All you need to do is add the `posthog` module to your `build.gradle`:

```bash
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.posthog.android:posthog:1.+'
}
```

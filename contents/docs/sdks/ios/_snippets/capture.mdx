Capture allows you to send events related to anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find 
patterns in usage, work out which features to improve, or find out where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

* `event name` to specify the event
  * We recommend using [noun] [verb], like `movie played` or `movie updated` to easily identify what your events mean later on.

Optionally you can submit:

* `properties`, which can be an array with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```objectivec
// in objective-c
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++" }];
```

```swift
// in swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"])
```

> If you're attempting this migration and having trouble, feel free to [ask a question in our community](/questions/topic/migration) or [raise a support ticket in the app](https://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal). 

## Requirements

- Existing PostHog instance that you can login to (Self-hosted versions need a minimum version of `1.30.0`, if you version is lower you'll need to upgrade to this version first)
- A new PostHog instance

## Approach

This migration has two parts:
1. [Migrate your events](#migrate-your-events), this will also create the necessary person, person distinct ID, and related records.
2. [Migrate your meta data](#migrate-your-meta-data) (projects, dashboards, insights, actions, cohorts, feature flags, experiments, annotations).
   - Note! It won't move over the following:
     1. Project API Key. You'll need to replace the API key in your code with the new API key.
     2. "created by" information. Every object will appear as if it was created by you.
     3. "created at" information. Every object will appear as if it was created on the time you ran this script.

> If you're attempting this migration, feel free to ask questions and provide feedback via the [PostHog Communty Slack workspace](/slack) or [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues).

## Requirements

- Existing PostHog instance that you can login to (Self-hosted versions need a minimum version of `1.30.0`, if you version is lower you'll need to upgrade to this version first)
- A new PostHog instance

## Approach

This migration has two parts:
1. [Migrate your events](#migrate-your-events), this will also create the necessary person, person distinct ID, and related records.
2. [Migrate your meta data](#migrate-your-meta-data) (projects, dashboards, insights, actions, cohorts, feature flags, experiments, annotations).
   - Note! It won't move over the following:
     1. Project API Key. You'll need to replace the API key in your code with the new API key.
     2. "created by" information. Every object will appear as if it was created by you.
     3. "created at" information. Every object will appear as if it was created on the time you ran this script.

## Migrate your events

<MigratingEvents/>

## Migrate your meta data

Follow the instructions on the [PostHog migrate metadata repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-migrate-meta):
1. Clone the repo and cd into it
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-migrate-meta
   cd posthog-migrate-meta
   ```
2. Install the dependencies by running `yarn`
3. Run the script
    ```bash
    ts-node --source [posthog instance you want to migrate from] --sourcekey [personal api key for that instance] --destination [posthog instance you want to migrate to.] --destinationkey [personal api key for destination instance]
    ```

For more information on the options see the [repo's readme](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-migrate-meta)

## Migrating your custom apps if you are moving from self-hosted to cloud

If the app was previously extracting events using the [scheduled tasks api](/docs/apps/build/reference#scheduled-tasks):
1. (fastest option) you could move this logic from the app into scheduled tasks on your server potentially using a cron job
2. If you can make your app generalizable enough that others can benefit then [submit your app](https://posthog.com/docs/apps/build/tutorial#submitting-your-app) to the store.
   - To make it generalizable you'll want to convert anything specific to your configuration into a plugin.json config value

If the app was transforming events before ingestion:
1. (fastest option) you could move this logic from the app into your client before you send the event
2. If you can make your app generalizable enough that others can benefit then [submit your app](https://posthog.com/docs/apps/build/tutorial#submitting-your-app) to the store.
   - To make it generalizable you'll want to convert anything specific to your configuration into a plugin.json config value

If the app was used to send events to a custom destinations:
1. (fastest option) Convert your app to work as a webhook. We are soon releasing a webhook destination. You can subscribe for updates on the [roadmap](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/13989)
2. If you can make your app generalizable enough that others can benefit then [submit your app](https://posthog.com/docs/apps/build/tutorial#submitting-your-app) to the store.
   - To make it generalizable you'll want to convert anything specific to your configuration into a plugin.json config value

   If the options above don't work and you were previously paying a substantial amount self-hosting then email us at [hey@posthog.com](mailto:hey@posthog.com) with a link to the public github repo and we can see if it's appropriate as a private cloud app.

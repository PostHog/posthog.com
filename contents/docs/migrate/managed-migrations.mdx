<MigrationWarning />

Managed migrations provide an automated way to migrate your historical data into PostHog without writing custom scripts.

With managed migrations, you can import data from multiple sources:

- **Direct imports**: Connect directly to Mixpanel or Amplitude using your API credentials
- **S3 imports**: Upload your event data to an S3 bucket in JSONL format for automatic ingestion

## Getting started

1. Go to the [managed migrations page](https://app.posthog.com/managed_migrations)
2. Choose your import method (details about methods below)
3. Import data

## Direct imports (Mixpanel & Amplitude)

Direct imports enable you to migrate data directly from Mixpanel or Amplitude without any manual data handling. PostHog automatically:

- Connects to your source platform using your API credentials
- Exports your data for the specified date range
- Transforms events to match PostHog's event schema
- Imports the data into your PostHog project

## S3 imports

S3 imports give you full control over your data transformation while still benefiting from automated ingestion. This method is ideal when you need:

- Custom event transformations
- To handle very large datasets
- To migrate from platforms not supported by direct imports

### Setting up an S3 import

1. **Prepare your data**: Export your events and format them as JSONL (one JSON object per line)
2. **Upload to S3**: Place your `.jsonl` files in an S3 bucket
3. **Start import**: Provide PostHog with:
  - S3 region
  - S3 bucket name
  - AWS access key ID
  - AWS secret access key
  - Content Type (the schema of the events that you uploaded to S3)

## When to use each method

### Use direct imports when:

- You have a straightforward migration from Mixpanel or Amplitude
- Your data volume is moderate
- You're comfortable with PostHog's default event transformation from your schema
- You want the simplest setup process

### Use S3 imports when:

- Your data volume is large
- You need custom event transformations or property mappings
- You're migrating from a platform not yet supported by direct imports
- You want to pre-process or clean your data before import

## Monitoring your migration

Once started, you can monitor your migration progress:
1. **Migration dashboard**: View real-time progress and status of your migration
2. **Event validation**: Query for your events as they come in to ensure proper transformation and ingestion

## Best practices

- **Test first**: Run a small test migration with a subset of your data against a new project. This ensures events have the desired schema without polluting your main project

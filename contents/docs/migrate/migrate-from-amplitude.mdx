<MigrationWarning />

Migrating from Amplitude is a two step process:

1. Export your data from Amplitude using the [Amplitude Export API](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/export-api/i).

2. [Import data into PostHog](/docs/migrate) using PostHog's Python SDK or `batch` API with the `historical_migration` option set to `true`.

### Capture the event

According to Amplitude's [Export API documentation](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/export-api/#response-schema), their event structure is:

```
{
  "event_time": UTC ISO-8601 formatted timestamp,
  "event_name": string,
  "device_id": string,
  "user_id": string | null,
  "event_properties": dict,
  "group_properties": dict,
  "user_properties": dict,
  
  // A bunch of other fields that include things like
  // device_carrier, city, etc.
  ...other_fields
}
```

When capturing events into PostHog, we need to convert this schema to PostHog's:

```python
distinct_id = user_id if user_id else device_id
event_message = {
  "properties": {
    **event_properties,
    **other_fields,
    "$set": {**user_properties},
    "$geoip_disable": True,
  },
  "event": event_type,
  "distinct_id": distinct_id,
  "timestamp": event_time,
}
```

In short:

- We track the event with the same name and timestamp
- For the distinct ID, we either use the User ID if present, or the Device ID (a UUID string) if not
- We track user properties using `properties: {$set}`
- We track event properties using `properties`

### Aliasing device IDs to user IDs

In addition to tracking the events, we want to tie users' both before and after login. For Amplitude, events before and after login look a bit like this:

| Event | User ID | Device ID |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Application installed | null | 551dc114-7604-430c-a42f-cf81a3059d2b |
| Login | 123 | 551dc114-7604-430c-a42f-cf81a3059d2b |
| Purchase | 123 | 551dc114-7604-430c-a42f-cf81a3059d2b |

We want to attribute "Application installed" to the user with ID 123, so we need to also call alias:

```python
posthog = Posthog(
    '<ph_project_api_key>', 
    host='<ph_client_api_host>',
    debug=True,
    historical_migration=True
)

posthog.alias(previous_id=device_id, distinct_id=user_id)
```

Since you only need to do this once per user, ideally you'd store a record (e.g. a SQL table) of which users you'd already sent to PostHog, so that you don't end up sending the same events multiple times.

> Prior to starting a historical data migration, ensure you do the following:
> 1. Create a project on our [US](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup) Cloud.
> 2. Sign up to a paid product analytics plan on [the billing page](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing) (historic imports are free but this unlocks the necessary features).
> 3. Raise an [in-app support request](http://us.posthog.com/home#supportModal) (Target Area: Data Management) detailing where you are sending events from, how, the total volume, and the speed. For example, "*we are migrating 30M events from a self-hosted instance to EU Cloud using the migration scripts at 10k events per minute.*"
> 4. Wait for the OK from our team before starting the migration process to ensure that it completes successfully and is not rate limited.
> 5. Set the `historical_migration` option to `true` when capturing events in the migration.

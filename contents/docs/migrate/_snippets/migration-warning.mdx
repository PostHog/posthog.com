> Prior to starting a historical data migration, ensure you do the following:
> 1. Talk to the PostHog Sales team if you are sending > 20M events and do not want to be charged
> 2. Create a project on our [US](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup) Cloud.
> 3. Sign up to a paid product analytics plan on [the billing page](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing) (historic imports are free but this unlocks the necessary features).
> 4. Set the `historical_migration` option to `true` when capturing events in the migration.

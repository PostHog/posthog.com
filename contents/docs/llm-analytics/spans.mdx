Spans are individual operations within your LLM application like function calls, vector searches, or data retrieval steps. They provide granular visibility into your application's execution flow beyond just LLM calls.

While [generations](/docs/llm-analytics/generations) capture LLM interactions and [traces](/docs/llm-analytics/traces) group related operations, spans track atomic operations that make up your workflow:

- **Vector database searches** - Document and embedding retrieval
- **Tool/function calls** - API calls, calculations, database queries  
- **RAG pipeline steps** - Retrieval, reranking, context building
- **Data processing** - Validation, chunking, formatting

For technical implementation details, see [manual capture](/docs/llm-analytics/manual-capture).

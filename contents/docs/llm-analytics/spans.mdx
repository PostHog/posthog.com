Spans are units of work within an LLM [trace](/docs/llm-analytics/traces). These are events that represent individual operations and discrete durations within your LLM application, like function calls, vector searches, or data retrieval steps, providing granular visibility into the execution flow.

PostHog automatically captures spans to track atomic operations that make up your LLM workflow. For example:

- **[Generations](/docs/llm-analytics/generations)** - LLM calls and interactions
- **Vector database searches** - Document and embedding retrieval
- **Tool/function calls** - API calls, calculations, database queries  
- **RAG pipeline steps** - Retrieval, reranking, context building
- **Data processing** - Validation, chunking, formatting

For technical implementation details, see [manual capture](/docs/llm-analytics/manual-capture).

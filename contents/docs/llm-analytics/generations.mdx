import GenerationEvent from "./_snippets/generation-event.mdx"

Generations are an event that capture an LLM request. The [generations tab](https://app.posthog.com/llm-analytics/generations) lists them along with the properties autocaptured by PostHog like the person, model, total cost, token usage, and more.

When you expand a generation, it includes the properties, metadata, a conversation history, the role (system, user, assistant), input content, and output content.

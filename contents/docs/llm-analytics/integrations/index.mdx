Outside of our native [LLM analytics product](/docs/llm-analytics/start-here), we've teamed up with various third-party platforms to track metrics for LLM apps. 

<CalloutBox title="Note">

These third-party integrations are no longer officially maintained. These guides may still be helpful, but we recommend using our [LLM analytics solution](/docs/llm-analytics/start-here) for a fully supported option.

## Third-party integrations

Currently, we have integrations for the following platforms:

- [Langfuse](/docs/llm-analytics/integrations/langfuse-posthog)
- [Helicone](/docs/llm-analytics/integrations/helicone-posthog) 
- [Traceloop](/docs/llm-analytics/integrations/traceloop-posthog)
- [Keywords AI](/docs/llm-analytics/integrations/keywords-ai-posthog)

## Dashboard templates

Once you've installed an integration, [dashboard templates](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) help you quickly set up relevant insights. Here are examples for [Langfuse](https://eu.posthog.com/shared/HPOaK5zNVkP062nQJQJoooXe61l15w), [Helicone](https://us.posthog.com/shared/6_Qa74au0RhxERZ3wW9g87oxWlFxNA), [Traceloop](https://us.posthog.com/shared/tpX9kUd5BbGkdjxQE8YhCskNuYA7Jw), and [Keywords AI](https://us.posthog.com/shared/p1AymhS7EEm97nZOGA8nWmsdshhzYA).

To create your own dashboard from a template:

1. Go the [dashboard tab](https://app.posthog.com/dashboard) in PostHog.
2. Click the **New dashboard** button in the top right.
3. Select **LLM metrics â€“ [name of the third-party integration you installed]** from the list of templates.

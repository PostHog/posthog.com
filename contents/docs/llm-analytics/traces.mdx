import TraceEvent from "./_snippets/trace-event.mdx"

Traces are a collection of [generations](/docs/llm-analytics/generations) and [spans](/docs/llm-analytics/spans) that capture a full interaction between a user and an LLM. The [traces tab](https://app.posthog.com/llm-analytics/traces) lists them along with the properties autocaptured by PostHog like the person, total cost, total latency, and more.

## Sessions vs Traces

- **Trace** (`$ai_trace_id`): Groups related generations and spans together. Required for all LLM analytics events.
- **Session** (`$ai_session_id`): Optional property that groups multiple traces together based on your chosen grouping strategy.

See the [Sessions](/docs/llm-analytics/sessions) documentation for more details on how to use `$ai_session_id`.

## Trace timeline

Clicking on a trace opens a timeline of the interaction with all the generation and span events. The trace timeline enables you to see the entire conversation, profiling details, and the individual generations and spans.

Traces consist of the following event hierarchy:

1. (Optional) A session (`$ai_session_id`) can group multiple traces together.
2. A trace (`$ai_trace_id`) is the top-level required grouping for LLM events.
3. A trace can contain multiple spans and generations.
4. A span can be the parent of other spans.
5. A generation can be the child of a span or trace.

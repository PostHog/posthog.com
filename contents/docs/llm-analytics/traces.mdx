import TraceEvent from "./_snippets/trace-event.mdx"

Traces are a collection of generations and spans that capture a full interaction between a user and an LLM. The [traces tab](https://app.posthog.com/llm-observability/traces) lists them along with the properties autocaptured by  PostHog like the person, total cost, total latency, and more.

Clicking on a trace opens a timeline of the interaction with all the generation and span events enabling you to see the entire conversation, details about the trace, and the individual generation and span events.

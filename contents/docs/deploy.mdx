PostHog offers a number of different deployment options:

-   [PostHog Cloud](#posthog-cloud) - Create a new PostHog Cloud deployment with just a few clicks.
    -   Recommended as it's **the fastest way** to try PostHog out. It's also **free** for up to 1m events/month.
    -   Comes with automatic updates and fully-managed infrastructure.
-   [PostHog Self-hosted](#posthog-self-hosted) - Recommended for users who need to keep data on their own infrastructure or private cloud.
-   [Hobby](#hobby-deployment) - Recommended for testing or very small hobby projects _(&lt;100k events/month)_

## PostHog Cloud

[PostHog Cloud](/pricing) is our managed hosting service and enables you to start using PostHog in only a few clicks.
We generally recommend this option for most users as it's the easiest to try out and offers the most features out of the box:

-   **1 million events included _free_ every month!**
-   Highly-scalable infrastructure to handle large event volumes
-   Automatic updates when new features are released

For more information, check out our [pricing](/pricing) page.

## Hobby deployment

The [Hobby](/docs/self-host/hobby) deployment is the most basic method for hosting PostHog yourself, and is suitable for testing or very small projects.
This deployment runs the entire PostHog stack on a single VM, meaning it can only handle relatively low event volumes (&lt;100k events/month).

For more information on setting up a hobby deployment, check out [our Hobby deployment docs](/docs/self-host/hobby) for instructions.

## PostHog Self-hosted

[PostHog Self-hosted](/docs/self-host) is the recommended method for hosting PostHog yourself and gives much better performance than the Hobby deployment.

This method offers a number of benefits over PostHog Cloud:

-   Customer data never leaves your infrastructure
-   First party cookies on your own domain
-   Full SQL access to your data _(Enterprise only)_

However, this also means that you will need to manage all updates, scaling, and security by yourself.
This method is generally best suited for those who need maximum control over their own data.

#### Post-deployment

If you've chosen to deploy via the [hobby](/docs/self-host/hobby) or [self-hosted](/docs/self-host) options, there may be some additional configuration you need to go through after getting your deployment set up.

PostHog is a platform of many products:

- [Product analytics](/docs/product-analytics) to help you quantitatively understand how users behave.
- [Web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) for quickly and easily marketing tracking website metrics.
- [Session replay](/docs/session-replay) for diagnosing issues and watching how users interact with your product.
- [Feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) for testing new features and safely rolling them out.
- [A/B testing](/docs/experiments) for scientifically verifying changes improve conversion.
- [Surveys](/docs/surveys) for collecting qualitative feedback, and running NPS, PMF and satisfaction surveys.

PostHog's Product OS is the foundation on which they're built. It includes things like:

- Our [APIs](/docs/api), which enable you to capture, evaluate, create, update, and delete nearly all of your information in PostHog, and [pull information into your app](/tutorials/customer-facing-analytics).

- [Notebooks](/docs/notebooks), which enable you to analyze data from all PostHog products in a single document you can share and collaborate on with teammates.

- [Data pipelines](/docs/cdp), which enable you to enrich your PostHog data from other sources, and integrate PostHog with other tools for marketing automation, sales, and support.

- The [PostHog toolbar](/docs/toolbar), which lets you easily toggle feature flags, inspect elements, create [Actions](/docs/data/actions), and see where users click.

- [HogQL](/docs/hogql), which grants you unrestricted access to your data via custom SQL queries for advanced, custom analysis.

It ties all your user and product data together, so you can focus on improving your product instead of engineering your data.ÃŸ

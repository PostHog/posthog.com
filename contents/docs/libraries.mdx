PostHog provides a number of both official and community maintained libraries to help you easily integrate with your preferred language or framework.

This document outlines all of our current client-side and server-side libraries, as well as which features each of them currently supports.

>**Note:** Session recording and autocapture are not possible in server libraries.

## Developer tools

In addition to SDKs, PostHog offers tools for managing your analytics infrastructure programmatically:

- **[Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PostHog/posthog/latest)** - Manage dashboards, insights, and other PostHog resources as infrastructure-as-code.

### Community-maintained tools

- **[Pulumi provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pulumi-posthog)** - A Pulumi port of the PostHog Terraform provider. Resources from the Terraform provider are synced into this package.
    - For issues or feedback, visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hckhanh/pulumi-any-terraform).
    - Requests for new resources should be made in the [Terraform provider repo](https://github.com/PostHog/terraform-provider-posthog).

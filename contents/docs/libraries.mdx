PostHog provides multiple libraries to send events from your app to your PostHog instance.

We have put a significant effort into providing as many of these libraries as possible, in order to make your experience better.

Our goal is for users to be able to integrate PostHog with their language and framework of choosing, without having to adapt their stack.

## Libraries

**All of PostHog's libraries support event capturing and user identification.**

However, certain features like session recording are only available with our JavaScript library. Refer to the table below for an overview of the functionality in each of our libraries.

> We're working to add support for feature flags and autocapture to as many libraries as possible. Please check out the individual library repositories for status on this and let us know if you think we should prioritize support for any specific library.

import {ProductScreenshot} from 'components/ProductScreenshot'

PostHog SQL is no ordinary SQL. One of its neatest tricks is that it supports HTML tags inside SQL, internally known as _HogQLX_.

This is valid PostHog SQL:

```sql
select
    timestamp,
    <span>This is <strong>{event}</strong>!<span> as html,
    <a href={f'https://admin/user/{distinct_id}'}>{person.properties.email}</a> as email
from events
```

This is rendered as:

{/* TODO: add all screenshots */}

### Special tags and components

#### `<a>`

Renders a link to another page or website.

```sql
select
    <a href='https://posthog.com'>Click me</a>,
    <a href={f'https://posthog.com/?t={now()}'} target='_blank'>Time to go</a>
```

#### `<redacted>`

Overlays the content with a redacted box, hiding it from view. It is only shown when you move your mouse over it. This is useful for sensitive information like emails or personal data.

```sql
select
    person.properties.name,
    <redacted>{person.properties.email}</redacted>
from events
```

#### `<Sparkline>`

Show an array of numbers as an inline sparkline.

```sql
select
    -- simplest case
    <Sparkline>{[1,2,3]}</Sparkline> as simple,

    -- with name and color, as a line
    <Sparkline name='My Data' color='blue' type='line'>{[1,2,3]}</Sparkline> as pretty,

    -- with labels for datapoints
    <Sparkline labels={['First', 'Second', 'Third']}>{[1,2,3]}</Sparkline> as notated,

    -- multiple series as children
    <Sparkline colors={['blue', 'green']} names={['aa', 'bb']}>{[1,2,3,4,5,2,4,5,2]}{[1,2,3,4,5,2,4,5,2]}</Sparkline> as big,

    -- everything via "data"
    <Sparkline data={[{'color': 'green', 'name': 'asd', 'values': [1,2,3]}, {'color': 'blue', 'values': [4,5,2]}]} /> as line
```

- `em`
- `strong`
- `span`
- `div`
- `p`
- `pre`

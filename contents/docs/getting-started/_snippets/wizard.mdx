Install PostHog in seconds with our wizard by running this command in your project directory with your terminal (it also works for [LLM coding agents](/blog/envoy-wizard-llm-agent) like Cursor and Bolt):

<AgentPrompt />

Wait for it to finish and test the setup once the wizard is complete.

The wizard supports React, Next.js, Svelte, and React Native. We've got more on the way.

Check out the wizard's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PostHog/wizard) for more details.

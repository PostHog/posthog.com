Install PostHog in seconds with our wizard by running this command in the terminal:

```bash
npx @posthog/wizard@latest
```

Wait for it to finish and test the setup once the wizard is complete.

Alternatively, you can use the wizard with [LLM coding agents](/blog/envoy-wizard-llm-agent) like Cursor and Bolt by using this prompt:

<AgentPrompt />

The wizard supports React, Next.js, Svelte, and React Native. We've got more on the way.

Check out the wizard's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PostHog/wizard) for more details.

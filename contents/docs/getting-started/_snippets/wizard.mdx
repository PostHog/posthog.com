Install PostHog in seconds with our wizard:

```bash
npx @posthog/wizard@latest
```

Running this command will do all the work. Wait for it to finish and test the setup once the wizard is complete.

Even better, you can use the wizard with [LLM coding agents like Cursor](/blog/envoy-wizard-llm-agent) and Bolt. Just paste this prompt into the agent chat:

<AgentPrompt />

The wizard supports React, Next.js, Svelte, and React Native. We've got more on the way.

Check out the wizard's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PostHog/wizard) for more details.

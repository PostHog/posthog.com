## 1. Add PostHog to your website

Installing PostHog on both your app and website enables you track the entire funnel of a user through acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue.

It's cheap, too. You can send us [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) from your website, which are up to 4x cheaper than the identified events used for product analytics.

You can then use our [built-in web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) to track your top pages, and how people find your website.

Read our [web analytics vs product analytics](/docs/web-analytics/web-vs-product-analytics) explainer for more.

## 2. Invite your team

PostHog is way more powerful when you're using it with your teammates.

To invite them, go to your instance homepage, click the "Invite" button, and add their email. 

This will add them to your organization with access to all your projects.

You can change their access levels in your organization settings, and set some projects to private if required.

## 3. Filter out internal users

You'll likely want to [filter out](/tutorials/filter-internal-users) events from internal users they trigger. 

To set this up, go to **Project Settings**, scroll down to **filter out internal and test users**.

Next, add filters to ignore events from local development addresses, and from users whose email does includes your company’s domain.

## 4. Migrate historical data from another tool

Are you migrating from another tool like PostHog?

1. Congratulations on a great descision. Go you.
2. Head to our [docs on historial migrations](/docs/migrate).

## 5. Watch your first session replay

Watching people using your product is like magic.

Once you've [enabled session replay](/docs/session-replay/installation) in your project, head to the [what to watch tab](https://us.posthog.com/replay/templates) in session replay to watch how users naviagte specific parts of your app.

Warning: watching replays is addictive, but incredibly useful.

## 6. Start sending PostHog data to other tools

As data arrives in PostHog, you can export it _immediately_ to other tools using [realtime destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations/). 

You can use this for things like:

- Conversion tracking
- Monitoring key events with your chat platform
- Enriching customer data in your CRM
- Triggering automations

We have dozens of pre-configured destinations, including [Slack](/docs/cdp/destinations/slack), [Discord](/docs/cdp/destinations/discord), [Hubspot](/docs/cdp/destinations/hubspot), [Intercom](/docs/cdp/destinations/hubspot), and a [webhook destination](/docs/cdp/destinations/webhook) for sending events to any HTTP endpoint.

Head to the [data pipelines](/docs/cdp) docs for more on how you can use PostHog as your customer data platform.

You can also configure [batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports/s3) to a data warehouse.

## 7. Import revenue and customer data into our data warehouse

When you choose PostHog, you also get a built-in data warehouse.

You can then [link your most valuable data](/docs/data-warehouse/join) from sources like your CRM, payment processor, or database, combine it with the event data already in PostHog, and query across all of it.

We currently offer fully-managed import integrations for the likes of [Stripe](/docs/cdp/sources/stripe), [Hubspot](/docs/cdp/sources/hubspot), and [Salesforce](/docs/cdp/sources/salesforce).

We also support important data from most popular data warehouses and databases, such as [Postgres](/docs/cdp/sources/postgres), [BigQuery](/docs/cdp/sources/bigquery), and [Amazon S3](/docs/cdp/sources/s3).

See the full [list of PostHog data sources](/docs/cdp/sources) for more. 

## 8. Figure out what to track in PostHog

PostHog has [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), so you're already collecting useful data from the moment you install our snippet.

But you'll still need to setup some custom events to get the most value from PostHog.

If you have no idea where to start, we recommend reading our guide to [Winning with PostHog](/docs/new-to-posthog/getting-hogpilled). It will guide you through:

- [Creating a tracking plan](/docs/new-to-posthog/getting-hogpilled) by defining your North Star metric.
- [How to track and measure activation](/docs/new-to-posthog/activation) – aka one of the most important metrics ever.
- [How to think about and track retention](/docs/new-to-posthog/retention) of users and customers.
- [Capturing revenue in PostHog](/docs/new-to-posthog/revenue), so you can monitor the health of your whole business.

## 9. Learn more about your data in PostHog

If you're new to analytics, and using PostHog, it's useful to have a basic understanding of what data we capture and how to work with it.

Read [Your data in PostHog](/docs/new-to-posthog/understand-posthog) for an introduction to our data model. 

## 10. Start testing in production

At PostHog, we test in production. There are many misconceptions about doing this. It does not mean:

- we commit to `main` every time we make a change.
- we randomly click around once the code releases to make sure it works.
- we ship code into production without testing it.

It means we use [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) to ship changes safely to small internal groups at first, then to select groups of beta testers, and so on.

Read more about:
- [Installing feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/installation) and [creating your first flag](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags)
- [How we test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production) at PostHog using feature flags
- [Best practices for using feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/best-practices) in your product

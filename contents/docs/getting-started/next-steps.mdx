## 1. Migrate historical data from another tool

Are you migrating from another tool like PostHog?

1. Congratulations on a great descision. Go you.
2. Head to our [docs on historial migrations](/docs/migrate).

## 2. Add PostHog to your website

Installing PostHog on both your app and website enables you track the entire funnel of a user through acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue.

It's cheap, too. You can send us [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) from your website, which are up to 4x cheaper than the identified events used for product analytics.

You can then use our [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) dashboard to track your top pages, how people find your website, and your [web vitals](/docs/web-analytics/web-vitals).

Read our [web analytics vs product analytics](/docs/web-analytics/web-vs-product-analytics) explainer for more.

## 3. Watch your first session replay

Watching people using your product is magic.

Once you've [enabled session replay](/docs/session-replay/installation) in your project, head to the [what to watch tab](https://us.posthog.com/replay/templates) in session replay to watch how users navigate specific parts of your app.

Warning: watching replays is addictive, but incredibly useful.

## 4. Import revenue and customer data into our data warehouse

When you choose PostHog, you also get a built-in data warehouse.

You can use it to [link your most valuable data](/docs/data-warehouse/join) from sources like your CRM, payment processor, or database, combine it with the event data already in PostHog, and query across all of it.

We currently offer fully-managed import integrations for the likes of [Stripe](/docs/cdp/sources/stripe), [Hubspot](/docs/cdp/sources/hubspot), and [Salesforce](/docs/cdp/sources/salesforce).

We also support important data from most popular data warehouses and databases, such as [Postgres](/docs/cdp/sources/postgres), [BigQuery](/docs/cdp/sources/bigquery), and [Amazon S3](/docs/cdp/sources/s3).

See the full [list of PostHog data sources](/docs/cdp/sources) for more. 

## 5. Start sending PostHog data to other tools

As data arrives in PostHog, you can export it _immediately_ to other tools using [realtime destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations/). 

You can use this for things like:

- Conversion tracking
- Monitoring key events with your chat platform
- Enriching customer data in your CRM
- Triggering automations

We have dozens of pre-configured destinations, including [Slack](/docs/cdp/destinations/slack), [Discord](/docs/cdp/destinations/discord), [Hubspot](/docs/cdp/destinations/hubspot), [Intercom](/docs/cdp/destinations/hubspot), and a [webhook destination](/docs/cdp/destinations/webhook) for sending events to any HTTP endpoint.

Head to the [data pipelines](/docs/cdp) docs for more on how you can use PostHog as your customer data platform.

You can also configure [batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports/s3) to a data warehouse.

## 7. Start testing in production

At PostHog, we test in production. This doesn't mean we:

- Commit to `main` every time we make a change.
- Randomly click around once the code releases to make sure it works.
- Ship code into production without testing it.

It means we use [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) to ship changes safely to small internal groups at first, then to select groups of beta testers, and so on.

Feature flags + testing in production = shipping features your uses love faster. 

Read more about:
- [Installing feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/installation) and [creating your first flag](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags)
- [How we test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production) at PostHog using feature flags
- [Best practices for using feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/best-practices) in your product

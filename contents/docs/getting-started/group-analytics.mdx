Group analytics is a powerful feature in PostHog that allows you to perform analytics on entities other than single users.
This feature is somewhat more advanced, but opens up completely new avenues for analytics and is essential for most B2B use-cases.

Group analytics can sometimes feel slightly confusing to new users, and often times this comes from skipping too quickly over the basic concepts.
We'll start with an overview of how Group analytics works, and then jump into creating our own group types and viewing them within PostHog.

## 1. What is a group?

It's best to start by clarifying what exactly we mean when we talk about a 'Group'?
In PostHog, a 'Group' is an entity that we can associate events and properties with that _is not_ a user.
Typically, every event we send will be connected to a single user through the `distinct_id` we use in our `identify` call, as we covered in the [Identifying users](/docs/getting-started/identify-users) guide.
Often times this is all you'll need, but for many use cases we also want to be able to analyze entities beyond just single users.

To get a more concrete idea of just how powerful groups can be, here are a couple examples of common entities that we can model using groups:

1. **Organizations/Teams**: It's very common in B2B apps to have multiple users under the same 'Team' account, in which case groups allow us to perform analytics on individual teams exactly as if they were users.
2. **Threads/Chats/Posts**: If you're creating a social app, you might want to track events that are connected with specific conversations such as replies

Looking at these examples, it might be tempting to think that 'Groups' work directly on Users. However, groups actually work by events, and only indirectly on users.
We'll see this later, but the basic idea is that **events are connected to groups directly, and any user who sent one of those events will also be linked indirectly**.
In this way, there isn't a way to directly 'assign' a user to a group - instead, this user would send **an event** with a special property linking it to a group, which would then associate the user with said group.
This may seem slightly confusing now, but it will become much clearer as we dig in to some code samples.

### Groups vs. group types

One more piece of terminology that's important to distinguish before we get started is the different between a **Group** and a **Group type**.
At a high level, a **Group type** is the abstract type of what our group represents (e.g. Teams, Group chats, Posts, etc.) whereas a **Group** is a specific instance of one of these types (e.g. a specific team or a specific group chat).

## 2. Creating a group type

Now that we're a little bit familiar with how Group analytics works, let's start by creating our first group type.
In this example, let's imagine that we're creating a simple group chat app.

<CreateGroupType />

To associate an event with a specific group, we provide two pieces of information the group type (`chat`) and the ID of the specific group (`84359520`).
This will both create a new `chat` Group type in PostHog and will also associate the `Message sent` event with the ID of the group we specified.
This ID is meant to uniquely identify the group that an event is related to, and is typically whatever unique ID you're using in your database.

## 3. Setting group properties

In addition to associating events with Groups, it's also common to want to set properties on them, which can be done in almost the exact same way as with individual users.
Let's try including the name of the group chat to our group.

<SetGroupProperties />

In `posthog-js`, we can use the same `group` method we saw above, while in the backend libraries we can use the `groupIdentify` method.

## 4. Using groups in PostHog

Our app is now fully set up to track events for each of our group chats!
We now have the ability to do analytics on chats, as well as being able to view which group chats a user is a member of directly in PostHog.

Here's an idea of the ways you can use groups within PostHog:

1. **Creating insights**: Groups can be used in insights in exactly the same way as people - we can analyze the total number of active groups, along with filtering events based on group properties
2. **Feature flags**: Roll out features to entire teams without worrying about different users seeing different things
3. **Related groups**: See all the different groups a specific user is related to

Groups offer a powerful way to extend PostHog to better fit your specific app.

[Person profiles](/docs/data/persons) are collections of properties about the users behind the events. You can use these user properties to better manage, analyze, and control data. 

For example, you can create [filters](/docs/product-analytics/trends#filtering-events-based-on-properties) or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) based on user properties, which can then be used to [create insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), and more. 

By default, PostHog captures events with person profiles. You can change this by setting your JavaScript initialization's `person_profiles` to `identified_only` or an event's `$process_person_profile` property to `false`.

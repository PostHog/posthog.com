User properties are a powerful feature in PostHog which enable you to better manage, analyze, and control data. You can create [filters](/docs/product-analytics/trends#filtering-events-based-on-properties) or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) based on user properties, which can then be used to [create insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), and more.

title: Data import and export
---

There are many ways to get data in and out of PostHog. In addition to the automated convenience of data pipeline sources and destinations, we’ve also got some manual options for bringing data in from other platforms.

## Data pipeline

Data pipeline streamlines the [ingest and export](/docs/cdp) of data to dozens of sources and destinations.

### Sources

[Combine data](docs/data-warehouse/setup) from your database, Stripe, or even a bucket full of CSVs. Join it to your existing person and event data with data warehouse.

### Destinations

[Export data as it arrives](/docs/cdp/destinations). Easily set up filters to get just the events you’re looking for. Choose from dozens of destinations, customize our webhook destination, or even build your own with a bit of code.

### Batch exports

Schedule [bulk data exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) to select destinations.

## Historical migration

PostHog offers [migration guides](/docs/migrate) to help you move your data from other providers.

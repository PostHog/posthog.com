title: Data import and export
---

There are many ways to get bulk data into and out of PostHog. In addition to the automated convenience of data pipeline sources and destinations, we’ve also got some manual options for bringing data in from other platforms.

## Import

### Sources

[Combine data](/docs/data-warehouse/setup) from your database, Stripe, or even a bucket full of CSVs. Join it to your existing person and event data with data warehouse.

### Migrations

PostHog offers [migration guides](/docs/migrate) to help you move your data from other providers.


## Export

### Real-time destinations

[Export data as it arrives](/docs/cdp/destinations). Easily set up filters to get just the events you’re looking for. Choose from dozens of destinations, customize our webhook destination, or even build your own with a bit of code.

### Batch exports

Schedule [bulk data exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) to select destinations.

### Query API

A full-featured [query API](/docs/api/query) allows you to programmatically extract data to use in your own applications.

### Export to CSV

Your insights and data tables within PostHog can be exported to CSV, with additional options like PNG for visualizations.

title: Data import and export
---

Beyond the everyday capture of user events, there are many ways to get bulk data into and out of PostHog.

## Import

### Sources

[Combine data](/docs/cdp/sources) from your database, Stripe, or even a bucket full of CSVs. Join it to your existing person and event data with [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse).

### Migrations

PostHog offers [migration guides](/docs/migrate) to help you move your data from other providers.

## Export

### Real-time destinations

[Export data as it arrives](/docs/cdp/destinations). Easily set up filters to get just the events youâ€™re looking for. Choose from dozens of destinations, customize our webhook destination, or even build your own with a bit of code.

### Batch exports

Schedule [bulk data exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) to select destinations, including Postgres, S3, and more.

### Query API

A full-featured [query API](/docs/api/query) allows you to programmatically extract data to use in your own applications.

### Export to CSV and more

Your insights and data tables within PostHog can be exported to CSV, with additional options like PNG for visualizations.

title: Quickstart with PostHog Cloud
---

## Introduction

This guide walks through setting up PostHog Cloud and sending your first events.
PostHog Cloud is our hosted and managed version of the PostHog open-source platform.
It always runs on the latest release with updates and migrations managed for you.

We recommend PostHog Cloud for almost all our users, as it's the easiest way to get PostHog running and is able to scale to large events volumes.
It also comes with 1m events free each month.

## 1. Create an account

To create a PostHog Cloud account, navigate to [app.posthog.com](https://app.posthog.com/signup) and fill in the details for your new account.

## 2. Set up your project

Once you've got your account set-up, you should see a screen that asks you where you'd like to send events from.
Select whichever option best matches your use case, or select 'Just Exploring' if you don't want to set up a full integration quite yet.

## 3. Send your first events

After you've selected an option, you'll be shown some instructions to get PostHog integrated with your platform of choice.
If you've chosen the 'Just Exploring' option, you'll instead be shown the PostHog bookmarklet, which can be used to temporarily send events from a webpage you're viewing to test your integration.

After you've followed these steps, you'll then be sent to a waiting screen where PostHog will listen for events to ensure your integration is set up correctly.

Once PostHog receives its first event, you should then see a success screen with a 'Complete' button that will take you to your dashboard.

If you are having trouble getting events to show up, you can click the back arrow to go back to instructions for each specific platform, or you can checkout [this page](/docs/integrate/ingest-live-data) for more detailed information on ingesting events into PostHog.
We'd recommend you don't skip this step unless you've already set-up another PostHog account before or if you've used other product analytics platforms.

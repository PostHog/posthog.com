> **Tip**: If you have multiple customer-facing products (e.g. a marketing website + iOS app + web app), it's best to install PostHog on them all and [group them in one project](/docs/data/organizations-and-projects). This way you can track the user across their entire journey.

<h3 class="mb-0 mt-6">Installation</h3>

import Install from "./\_snippets/install.mdx"

<Install />

#### Set up a reverse proxy (optional)

We recommend setting up a reverse proxy to send events to PostHog using your domain, so they're less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers. There are several [options for creating a reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy), including using [Cloudflare](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudflare), [AWS Cloudfront](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudfront), and [Vercel](/docs/advanced/proxy/vercel).

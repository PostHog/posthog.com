Once your PostHog instance is up and running, the next step is to get PostHog installed.

> **Tip**: Even if you have multiple customer-facing products e.g. a marketing website + iOS app + web app, it works best to have them share the same project to track the user across their journey. See: [Organizations & projects docs](/manual/organizations-and-projects)

PostHog allows you to identify your users with an ID of your choice. This enables PostHog to associate events with specific users, track them on different platforms, and connect events from before and after users log in for the first time.

All events within PostHog are associated with a specific person, either an **Anonymous person** or an **Identified person**, typically based on whether they're logged in to your application or not.

Identifying users is done using the `identify` method in one of our SDKs.

## 1. Anonymous users <Badge>Client</Badge>

When a user starts browsing on your website or app, they'll be automatically assigned an **anonymous ID**, which is then stored locally and allows us to track anonymous users even across different sessions.
This anonymous ID is created using the user's device ID and will typically look like `17b845b08de74-033c497ed2753c-35667c03-1fa400-17b845b08dfd55`.

In order to track users across different devices, we will use the `identify` method to associate events with a logged-in user rather than simply the device they are using.

## 2. Identifying a user when they sign up <Badge>Client</Badge> <Badge>Server</Badge>

To start, let's walk through the flow of identifying a user as they are signing up for our service for the first time.
This is one of the most important areas to get right when setting up analytics, but it can sometimes feel daunting when setting it up for the first time.

We'll start by following a user viewing your website for the first time; as mentioned above, this user is first assigned a unique anonymous ID, which we start using to send events.

### Identifying our newly created user <Badge>Server</Badge>

Now, this user navigates to your login flow and goes through the process of creating an account.
After your backend logic handles creating an account, you'll then want to call `identify` to create a person within PostHog.

<IdentifyUserBackend />

For the `distinct_id`, you'll typically want to use whatever unique ID was assigned to the user within your database or a unique piece of information such as their `email`.

### Linking past events with our new user <Badge>Client</Badge>

Now that we've created our new user, the next step is to associate any past events that were sent with the old anonymous ID with this new user.

On the client side, this is done by calling `identify` with the same `distinct_id` that we just used in our backend `identify` call.

```js
// Using the 'distinct_id' returned to us from the server
posthog.identify('distinct_id')
```

Calling `identify` from the frontend will do two things:

1. PostHog will merge all the previous events from our anonymous user into our new user (`distinct_id`)
2. All future events will be associated with this new user (`distinct_id`), even if we still use their anonymous ID

Effectively, these two users have been merged into one.
By combining our anonymous user with our newly created user, we can answer important questions about our onboarding flow such as conversion rate and total unique users.

## 3. Identifying logged-in users <Badge>Client</Badge>

Now that we've covered the process of handling a user first signing up, the next question is what to do when this user returns.

In most cases, all we need to do is call `identify` whenever they return back to our site with whatever `distinct_id` we previously used!

```js
// The same 'distinct_id' as before
posthog.identify('distinct_id', {
    name: 'Max Hedgehog',
    email: 'max@hedgehogmail.com',
    // ... any other user properties
}
```

You'll usually want to call `identify` every time your application initially loads, or directly after log in if a user first landed on your website while logged out.
Typically you'll want this to be the first call you make to PostHog - before sending any events with `capture` - so making the call _as soon as you can determine the `distinct_id` of the user_ is best.

There's no gotcha's with calling `identify` multiple times for the same user **as long as you continue to pass the same `distinct_id`**, so feel free to call it multiple times throughout a session.

## 4. Setting user properties <Badge>Client</Badge> <Badge>Server</Badge>

In addition to adding extra data to specific events like we discussed earlier, it's also very common to want to also set properties on users as well.

As shown above, each time you call `identify`, you can pass in a `properties` object which will be set on the user. We suggest passing in all the user properties you have available each time they login, as this will ensure that their user profile on PostHog is up to date.

Tracking properties on users becomes incredibly useful when we start creating insights, which we'll cover in the next guide.

In PostHog, we can also include special `$set` and `$set_once` properties on events to set properties for whichever user is sending the event.

### What is the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`?

If a `$set` property is included on an event, it will replace whatever value may have already been set on a person for a specific property.
In contrast, `$set_once` will only set the property if it has never been set before.

`$set` is typically used for properties that you always want up-to-date information for (email, current plan, etc.), while `$set_once` is typically only used for information related to when a user first is seen (first URL they viewed, first time they logged in). 

In summary: `set` always overrides, `set_once` only writes when the property doesn't already exist on the user.

For example:

```js
posthog.people.set({ plan: 'free_trail' })
posthog.people.set({ plan: 'premium' })

// { plan: 'premium' }

posthog.people.set_once({ initial_location: 'London })
posthog.people.set_once({ initial_location: 'Rome' })

// { initial_location: 'London' }
```

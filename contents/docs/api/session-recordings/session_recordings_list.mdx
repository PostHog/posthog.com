This endpoint **does not** provide the raw JSON of the replays. To get the raw JSON, you need to click **Export as JSON** in the replay options menu in-app. If you want us to build exports or have a strong opinion on how you'd like to use them, vote or comment on [this issue on our roadmap](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/15164).

> **Update:** These endpoints can now be accessed with either your Team API key or your [personal API key](/docs/api/overview).

As explained in our [API overview](/docs/api/overview) page, PostHog provides two different APIs.

This page refers to our public endpoints, which use the same API key as the [PostHog snippet](/docs/integrate/client/js). The endpoints documented here are used solely with `POST` requests, and will not return any sensitive data from your PostHog instance.

> **Note:** For this API, you should use your 'Project API Key' from the 'Project' page in PostHog. This is the same key used in your frontend snippet.

# Sending events

To send events to PostHog, you can use any of [our libraries](/docs/integrate/overview) **or** any Mixpanel library by changing the `api_host` setting to the address of your instance.

If you'd prefer to do the requests yourself, you can send events in the following format:

## Single event

> **Note:** Timestamp is optional. If not set, it'll automatically be set to the current time.

```shell
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "[event name]",
    "distinct_id": "[your users' distinct id]",
    "properties": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    },
    "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
}
```

## Batch events

You can send multiple events in one go with the Batch API.

There is no limit on the number of events you can send in a batch, but the entire request body must be less than 20MB by default (see [API overview](/docs/api/overview)).

> **Note:** Timestamp is optional. If not set, it'll automatically be set to the current time.

```bash
POST https://[your-instance].com/batch/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "batch": [
        {
            "event": "[event name]",
            "properties": {
                "distinct_id": "[your users' distinct id]",
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
            },
            "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

            "date_joined": "2020-01-23T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
    }
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/ # if you're self-hosting, replace this with the URL of your instance
```

## Identify

## Responses

### Status code: 200

#### Responses

```js
{
    status: 1
}
```

**Meaning:** A `200: OK` response means we have successfully received the payload, it is in the correct format, and the project API key (token) is valid. It **does not** imply that events are valid and will be ingested. As mentioned under [Invalid events](#invalid-events), certain event validation errors may cause an event not to be ingested.

### Status code: 400

#### Responses

```js
{
    type: 'validation_error',
    code: 'invalid_project',
    detail: 'Invalid Project ID.',
    attr: 'project_id'
}
```

**Meaning:** We were unable to determine the project to associate the events with.

### Status code: 401

#### Responses

```js
{
    type: 'authentication_error',
    code: 'invalid_api_key',
    detail: 'Project API key invalid. You can find your project API key in PostHog project settings.',
}
```

**Meaning:** The token/API key you provided is invalid.

<br />

```js
{
    type: 'authentication_error',
    code: 'invalid_personal_api_key',
    detail: 'Invalid Personal API key.',
}
```

**Meaning:** The personal API key you used for authentication is invalid.

### Status code: 503 (Deprecated)

#### Responses

```js
{
    type: 'server_error',
    code: 'fetch_team_fail',
    detail: 'Unable to fetch team from database.'
}
```

**Meaning:** (Deprecated) This error will only occur in self-hosted Postgres instances if the database becomes unavailable. On ClickHouse-backed instances database failures cause events to be added to a dead letter queue, from which they can be recovered.

## Invalid events

We perform basic validation on the payload and project API key (token), returning a failure response if an error is encountered.

However, we **will not return an error** to the client when the following happens:

-   An event does not have a name
-   An event does not have the `distinct_id` field set
-   The `distinct_id` field of an event has an empty value

The three cases above will cause the event to not be ingested, but you will still receive a `200: OK` response from us.

This approach allows us to process events asynchronously if necessary, ensuring reliability and low latency for our event ingestion endpoints.

## Reading data from PostHog

We have another set of APIs to read/modify anything in PostHog. See our [API documentation](/docs/api/overview) for more information.

Also, feel free to [reach out](https://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal) if you'd like help with the API.

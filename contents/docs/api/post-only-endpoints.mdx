PostHog provides POST-only public endpoints to capture events, update user or group data, evaluate feature flags, and more. These use your [project API key](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) and do not return any sensitive data from your PostHog instance.

## Sending events

PostHog is event-based meaning your analytics data takes the form of a value sent by a specific user with optional additional data. Much of the functionality of PostHog, including updating users or groups, combining users, and evaluating feature flags, is driven by this event-based structure. [Our SDKs](/docs/libraries) handle the different types of events for you, but with the API, you need to send the right type of event (listed below) to get the functionality you want. The default PostHog events have the `$` prefix. 

> **Note:** Make sure to send API requests to the correct domain. These are `https://app.posthog.com` for US Cloud, `https://eu.posthog.com` for EU Cloud, and your self-hosted domain for self-hosted instances. Confirm yours by checking your URL from your PostHog instance.

Here are examples of the types of events you can send:

### Single event

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "event": "event name",
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "distinct_id": "user distinct id",
  "properties": {
    "account_type": "pro"
  },
  "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/ 

```

### Batch events

You can a list of multiple events in one request with the `/batch` API route.

There is no limit on the number of events you can send in a batch, but the entire request body must be less than 20MB by default.

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "batch": [
    {
      "event": "batched_event_name_1",
      "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "user distinct id",
        "account_type": "pro"
      },
      "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
    }
    # ...
  ]
}' https://app.posthog.com/batch/ 
```

### Alias

This assigns another distinct ID to the same user. Read more in our [identify docs](/docs/product-analytics/identify).

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "distinct_id": "123",
  "properties": {
    "alias": "456"
  },
  "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]",
  "event": "$create_alias"
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/
```

### Groups

Captures a group event. Read more in our [group analytics docs](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics).

> **Note:** `company` is a [group type](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics#groups-vs-group-types). You can set it to the value you want such as `organization`, `project`, or `channel`.

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "event": "$event",
  "distinct_id": "1234",
  "properties": {
    "$groups": {"company": "<company_name>"}
  }
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/
```

### Group identify

Updates group information. Read more in our [group analytics docs](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics).

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "event": "$groupidentify",
  "distinct_id": "groups_setup_id",
  "properties": {
    "$group_type": "<group_type>",
    "$group_key": "<company_name>",
    "$group_set": {
      "name": "<company_name>",
      "subscription": "premium"
      "date_joined": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
    }
  }
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/
```

### Identify

Updates user information. Read more in our [identify docs](/docs/product-analytics/identify).

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-16 09:03:11.913767",
  "properties": {
    "$set": {},
  },
  "distinct_id": "1234",
  "event": "$identify"
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/
```

### Pageview

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "properties": {
    "title": "TheTitle"
  },
  "timestamp": "2020-08-16T09:03:11.913767",
  "distinct_id": "1234",
  "event": "$pageview"
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/
```

### Screen view

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "properties": {
    "$screen_name": "TheScreen"
  },
  "timestamp": "2020-08-16T09:03:11.913767",
  "distinct_id": "1234",
  "event": "$screen"
}' https://app.posthog.com/capture/
```

## Feature flags

<APIFeatureFlagsCode />

## Responses

### Status code: 200

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": 1
}
```

**Meaning:** A `200: OK` response means we have successfully received the payload, it is in the correct format, and the project API key (api_key) is valid. It **does not** imply that events are valid and will be ingested. As mentioned under [Invalid events](#invalid-events), certain event validation errors may cause an event not to be ingested.

### Status code: 400

**Responses:**

```json
{
  "type": "validation_error", 
  "code": "invalid_project",
  "detail": "Invalid Project ID.",
  "attr": "project_id"
}
```

**Meaning:** We were unable to determine the project to associate the events with.

```json
{
  "type": "validation_error", 
  "code": "invalid_payload", 
  "detail": "Malformed request data", 
  "attr": null
}
```

**Meaning:** Request payload data formatted incorrectly.

### Status code: 401

**Responses:**

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_error",
  "code": "invalid_api_key",
  "detail": "Project API key invalid. You can find your project API key in PostHog project settings."
}
```

**Meaning:** The project API key you provided is invalid.

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_error",
  "code": "invalid_personal_api_key",
  "detail": "Invalid Personal API key."
}
```

**Meaning:** The personal API key you used for authentication is invalid.

### Status code: 503 (Deprecated)

**Response:**

```json
{
  "type": "server_error",
  "code": "fetch_team_fail",
  "detail": "Unable to fetch team from database."
}
```

**Meaning:** (Deprecated) This error only occurs in self-hosted Postgres instances if the database becomes unavailable. On ClickHouse-backed instances database failures cause events to be added to a dead letter queue, from which they can be recovered.

## Invalid events

We perform basic validation on the payload and project API key (api_key), returning a failure response if an error is encountered.

PostHog **does not return an error** to the client when the following happens:

- An event does not have a name
- An event does not have the `distinct_id` field set
- The `distinct_id` field of an event has an empty value

These three cases above cause the event to not be ingested, but you still receive a `200: OK` response from PostHog.

This approach enables us to process events asynchronously if necessary, ensuring reliability and low latency for our event ingestion endpoints.

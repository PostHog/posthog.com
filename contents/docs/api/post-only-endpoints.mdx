> **Update:** These endpoints can now be accessed with either your Team API Key or your [Personal API Key](/docs/api/overview).

<br />


As explained in our [API Overview](/docs/api/overview-overview) page, PostHog provides two different APIs. 

This page refers to our public endpoints, which use the same API key as the [PostHog snippet](/docs/integrations/js-integration). The endpoints documented here are used solely with `POST` requests, and will not return any sensitive data from your PostHog instance. 

> **Note:** For this API, you should use your 'Project API Key' from the 'Project' page in PostHog. This is the same key used in your frontend snippet.

## Feature Flags

PostHog offers support for [feature flags](/docs/features/feature-flags), and you can use our APIs to create and make use of feature flags. However, it is important to note that while creating a feature flag is a private action that only your team should be able to perform, checking if a feature flag is active is not. 

As such, to create feature flags, you will need to use another endpoint, which we're currently still documenting. However, to check if a feature flag is enabled, you can use the following endpoint:

#### /decide

`/decide` is the endpoint used to determine if a given flag is enabled for a certain user or not. This endpoint is used by our [JavaScript integration's](/docs/integrations/js-integration) methods for feature flags.

To get the feature flags that are enabled for a given user, you will need to perform the following request:

```shell
POST <ph_instance_address>/decide/ # e.g. https://posthog.yourcompany.com for self-hosted users
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "distinct_id": "[user's distinct id]"
}
```

##### Example Request & Response

**Request**

```shell
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '  {
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "distinct_id": "1234"
}' https://app.posthog.com/decide/
```

**Response**

```shell
{
  "config": {
    "enable_collect_everything": true
  },
  "editorParams": {},
  "isAuthenticated": false,
  "supportedCompression": [
    "gzip",
    "lz64"
  ],
  "featureFlags": [
    "my-awesome-flag-1",
    "my-awesome-flag-2"
  ]
}
```

From this response, if you are looking to use feature flags in your backend, you will most likely need only the values for the `"featureFlags"` key, which indicate what flags are on for the user with the distinct ID you provided. These flags persist for users (unless you change your flag settings), so you can cache them rather than send a request to the endpoint each time if you so wish.


## Sending events

To send events to PostHog, you can use any of [our libraries](/docs/integrations) **or** any Mixpanel library by changing the `api_host` setting to the address of your instance. 

If you'd prefer to do the requests yourself, you can send events in the following format:

## Single event

> **Note:** Timestamp is optional. If not set, it'll automatically be set to the current time.

```shell
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "[event name]",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "[your users' distinct id]",
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    },
    "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
}
```

## Batch events

You can send multiple events in one go with the Batch API.

> **Note:** Timestamp is optional. If not set, it'll automatically be set to the current time.

```bash
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "batch": [
        {
            "event": "[event name]",
            "properties": {
                "distinct_id": "[your users' distinct id]",
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
            },
            "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Sample Requests

Here are some sample `curl` queries for each event type. Do note that you need to insert your API key into the `api_key` field.

Additionally, if you're self-hosting, you'll have to substitute `https://app.posthog.com/` for the URL of your instance.

curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{

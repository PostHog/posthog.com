API queries enable you to query your data in PostHog. This is useful for:

- Building user or [customer-facing analytics](/tutorials/customer-facing-analytics). 
- Pulling aggregated PostHog data into your own or other apps.

> **When should you _not_ use API queries?**
> 1. When you want to export large amounts of data. Use [batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) instead.
> 2. When you want to send data to destinations like Slack or webhooks immediately. Use [real-time destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations) instead.

## Prerequisites

Using API queries requires:

1. A PostHog project and its project ID which you can get from [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#variables).
2. A personal API key for your project with the **Query Read** permission. You can create this in [your user settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#personal-api-keys).

## Creating a query

To create a query, you make a `POST` request to the `/api/projects/:project_id/query/` endpoint. The body of the request should be a JSON object with a `query` property with a `kind` and `query` property. 

For example, to create a query that gets events where the `$current_url` contains blog, you use `kind: HogQLQuery` and SQL like:

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/ \
  -d '{
        "query": {
          "kind": "HogQLQuery",
          "query": "select properties.$current_url from events where properties.$current_url like '\''%/blog%'\'' limit 100"
        }
      }'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/{project_id}/query/"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}'
}
payload = {
    "query": {
        "kind": "HogQLQuery",
        "query": "select properties.$current_url from events where properties.$current_url like '%/blog%' limit 100"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json())
```

```node
import fetch from "node-fetch";

async function createQuery() {
  const url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/";
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}"
  };

  const payload = {
    "query": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "select properties.$current_url from events where properties.$current_url like '%/blog%' limit 100"
    }
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

createQuery()
```

</MultiLanguage>

This is also useful for querying non-event data like persons, data warehouse, session replay metadata, and more. For example, to get a list of all people with the `email` property:

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/ \
  -d '{
        "query": {
          "kind": "HogQLQuery",
          "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
        }
      }'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/{project_id}/query/"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}'
}
payload = {
    "query": {
        "kind": "HogQLQuery",
        "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json())
```

```node
import fetch from "node-fetch";

async function createQuery() {
  const url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/";
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}"
  };

  const payload = {
    "query": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
    }
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

createQuery()
```

</MultiLanguage>

Every query you run is logged in the `query_log` table along with details like duration, read bytes, read rows, and more.

## Writing performant queries

Since the query endpoint accesses PostHog's data warehouse directly, it's important to write performant queries. We aren't able to optimize these queries for you like we would with other products. Here is some advice:

### 1. Use shorter time ranges

You should almost always include a time range in your queries, and the shorter the better. There are a variety of SQL features to help you do this including `now()`, `INTERVAL`, and `dateDiff`. See more about these in our [SQL docs](/docs/product-analytics/sql#date-and-time).

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/ \
  -d '{
        "query": {
          "kind": "HogQLQuery",
          "query": "SELECT count() FROM events WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY"
        }
      }'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/{project_id}/query/"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}'
}
payload = {
    "query": {
        "kind": "HogQLQuery",
        "query": """
          SELECT count()
          FROM events
          WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
          LIMIT 100
        """
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json())
```

```node
import fetch from "node-fetch";

async function createQuery() {
  const url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/";
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}"
  };

  const payload = {
    "query": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": `
        SELECT count()
        FROM events
        WHERE timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
        LIMIT 100
      `
    }
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

createQuery()
```

</MultiLanguage>

### 2. Materialize a view for the data you need

The data warehouse enables you to [save and materialize views](/docs/data-warehouse/views#materializing-and-scheduling-a-view) of your data. This means that the view is precomputed, which can significantly improve query performance.

To do this, write your query in the [SQL editor](https://us.posthog.com/sql), click **Materialize**, then **Save and materialize**, and give it a name without spaces (I chose `mat_event_count`). You can also schedule to update the view at a specific interval.

<ProductScreenshot

  imageDark="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Clean_Shot_2025_06_19_at_16_12_44_2x_90bd8f28ca.png"
  alt="Materialize view"
  classes="rounded"
/>

Once done, you can query the view like any other table.

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/ \
  -d '{
        "query": {
          "kind": "HogQLQuery",
          "query": "SELECT * FROM mat_event_count"
        }
      }'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/{project_id}/query/"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}'
}
payload = {
    "query": {
        "kind": "HogQLQuery",
        "query": """
          SELECT *
          FROM mat_event_count
        """
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json())
```

```node
import fetch from "node-fetch";

async function createQuery() {
  const url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/";
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}"
  };

  const payload = {
    "query": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": `
        SELECT *
        FROM mat_event_count
      `
    }
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

createQuery()
```

</MultiLanguage>

### 3. Don't scan the same table multiple times

Reading a large table like `events` or `persons` more than once in the same query multiplies the work PostHog has to do (more I/O, more CPU, more memory). For example, this query is inefficient:

```sql
WITH us_events AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM events
    WHERE properties.$geoip_country_code = 'US'
),
ca_events AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM events
    WHERE properties.$geoip_country_code = 'CA'
)
SELECT *
FROM us_events
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM ca_events
```

Instead, pull the rows you need **once**, typically in a first CTE, and have every later step reference that CTE like this:

```sql
WITH base_events AS (              -- one read only
    SELECT event, properties.$geoip_country_code as country
    FROM events
    WHERE properties.$geoip_country_code IN ('US', 'CA')
),
us_events AS (
    SELECT event
    FROM base_events
    WHERE country = 'US'
),
ca_events AS (
    SELECT event
    FROM base_events
    WHERE country = 'CA'
)
SELECT *
FROM us_events
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM ca_events
```

### 4. Other SQL optimizations

Option 1 and 2 make the most difference, but other generic SQL optimizations work too. See our [SQL docs](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for commands, useful functions, and more to help you with this.

## Query parameters

Top level request parameters include:

- `query` (required): Specifies what data to retrieve. This must include a `kind` property that defines the query type.
- `client_query_id` (optional): A client-provided identifier for tracking the query.
- `refresh` (optional): Controls caching behavior and execution mode (sync vs async).
- `filters_override` (optional): Dashboard-specific filters to apply.
- `variables_override` (optional): Variable overrides for queries that support variables.
- `name` (optional): A name for the query to better identify it in the `query_log` table.

### Caching and execution modes

The `refresh` parameter controls the execution mode of the query. It can be one of the following values:

- `blocking` (default): Executes synchronously unless fresh results exist in cache
- `async`: Executes asynchronously unless fresh results exist in cache
- `force_blocking`: Always executes synchronously
- `force_async`: Always executes asynchronously
- `force_cache`: Only returns cached results (never calculates)
- `lazy_async`: Use extended cache period before asynchronous calculation
- `async_except_on_cache_miss`: Use cache but execute synchronously on cache miss

> **Tip:** To cancel a running query, send a `DELETE` request to the `/api/projects/:project_id/query/:query_id/` endpoint.

### Query types

The `kind` property in the `query` parameter can be one of the following values. 

- `HogQLQuery`: Queries using [PostHog's version of SQL](/docs/sql).
- `EventsQuery`: Raw event data retrieval
- `TrendsQuery`: Time-series trend analysis
- `FunnelsQuery`: Conversion funnel analysis
- `RetentionQuery`: User retention analysis
- `PathsQuery`: User journey path analysis

Beyond `HogQLQuery`, these are mostly used to power PostHog internally and are not useful for you, but you can see the [frontend query schema](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/queries/schema/schema-general.ts) for a complete list and more details.

## Response structure

The response format depends on the query type, but all responses include:

- `results`: The data returned by the query
- `is_cached` (for cached responses): Indicates the result came from cache
- `timings` (when available): Performance metrics for the query execution

### Cached responses

API queries are cached by default. You can check if a response is cached by checking the `is_cached` property. Responses also contain cache-related details like:

- `cache_key`: A unique identifier for the cached result
- `cache_target_age`: The timestamp until which the cached result is considered valid
- `last_refresh`: When the data was last computed
- `next_allowed_client_refresh`: The earliest time when a client can request a fresh calculation

### Asynchronous queries

For asynchronous queries (like ones with `refresh: async`), the initial response includes a query status with its completion status, query ID, start time, and more:

```json
{
  "query_status": {
    "id": "2fbd4b19413342a4ad08c307155187bc",
    "team_id": 123,
    "complete": false
  }
}
```

You can then poll the status by sending a `GET` request to the `/api/projects/:project_id/query/:query_id/` endpoint.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/$QUERY_ID/
```

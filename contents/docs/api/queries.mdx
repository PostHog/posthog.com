API queries enable you to query your data in PostHog. This is useful for:

- Building user or [customer-facing analytics](/tutorials/customer-facing-analytics). 
- Pulling aggregated PostHog data into your own or other apps.

> **When should you _not_ use API queries?**
> 1. When you want to export large amounts of data. Use [batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) instead.
> 2. When you want to send data to destinations like Slack or webhooks immediately. Use [real-time destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations) instead.

## Prerequisites

Using API queries requires:

1. A PostHog project and its project ID which you can get from [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#variables).
2. A personal API key for your project with the **Query Read** permission. You can create this in [your user settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys#personal-api-keys).

## Creating a query

To create a query, you make a `POST` request to the `/api/projects/:project_id/query/` endpoint. The body of the request should be a JSON object with a `query` property with a `kind` and `query` property. 

For example, to create a query that gets events where the `$current_url` contains blog, you use `kind: HogQLQuery` and SQL like:

<MultiLanguage>


```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/ \
  -d '{
        "query": {
          "kind": "HogQLQuery",
          "query": "select properties.$current_url from events where properties.$current_url like '\''%/blog%'\'' limit 100"
        }
      }'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/{project_id}/query/"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}'
}
payload = {
    "query": {
        "kind": "HogQLQuery",
        "query": "select properties.$current_url from events where properties.$current_url like '%/blog%' limit 100"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json())
```

```node
import fetch from "node-fetch";

async function createQuery() {
  const url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/";
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}"
  };

  const payload = {
    "query": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "select properties.$current_url from events where properties.$current_url like '%/blog%' limit 100"
    }
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

createQuery()
```

</MultiLanguage>

This is also useful for querying non-event data like persons, data warehouse, session replay metadata, and more. For example, to get a list of all people with the `email` property:

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/ \
  -d '{
        "query": {
          "kind": "HogQLQuery",
          "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
        }
      }'
```

```python
import requests
import json

url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/{project_id}/query/"
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}'
}
payload = {
    "query": {
        "kind": "HogQLQuery",
        "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json())
```

```node
import fetch from "node-fetch";

async function createQuery() {
  const url = "<ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/";
  const headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}"
  };

  const payload = {
    "query": {
      "kind": "HogQLQuery",
      "query": "select properties.email from persons where properties.email is not null"
    }
  }

  const response = await fetch(url, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

createQuery()
```

</MultiLanguage>

Every query you run is logged in the `query_log` table along with details like duration, read bytes, read rows, and more.

## Query parameters

Top level request parameters include:

- `query` (required): Specifies what data to retrieve. This must include a `kind` property that defines the query type.
- `client_query_id` (optional): A client-provided identifier for tracking the query.
- `refresh` (optional): Controls caching behavior and execution mode (sync vs async).
- `filters_override` (optional): Dashboard-specific filters to apply.
- `variables_override` (optional): Variable overrides for queries that support variables.
- `name` (optional): A name for the query to better identify it in the `query_log` table.

### Caching and execution modes

The `refresh` parameter controls the execution mode of the query. It can be one of the following values:

- `blocking` (default): Executes synchronously unless fresh results exist in cache
- `async`: Executes asynchronously unless fresh results exist in cache
- `force_blocking`: Always executes synchronously
- `force_async`: Always executes asynchronously
- `force_cache`: Only returns cached results (never calculates)
- `lazy_async`: Use extended cache period before asynchronous calculation
- `async_except_on_cache_miss`: Use cache but execute synchronously on cache miss

> **Tip:** To cancel a running query, send a `DELETE` request to the `/api/projects/:project_id/query/:query_id/` endpoint.

### Query types

The `kind` property in the `query` parameter can be one of the following values. 

- `HogQLQuery`: Queries using [PostHog's version of SQL](/docs/sql).
- `EventsQuery`: Raw event data retrieval
- `TrendsQuery`: Time-series trend analysis
- `FunnelsQuery`: Conversion funnel analysis
- `RetentionQuery`: User retention analysis
- `PathsQuery`: User journey path analysis

Beyond `HogQLQuery`, these are mostly used to power PostHog internally and are not useful for you, but you can see the [frontend query schema](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/queries/schema/schema-general.ts) for a complete list and more details.

## Response structure

The response format depends on the query type, but all responses include:

- `results`: The data returned by the query
- `is_cached` (for cached responses): Indicates the result came from cache
- `timings` (when available): Performance metrics for the query execution

### Cached responses

API queries are cached by default. You can check if a response is cached by checking the `is_cached` property. Responses also contain cache-related details like:

- `cache_key`: A unique identifier for the cached result
- `cache_target_age`: The timestamp until which the cached result is considered valid
- `last_refresh`: When the data was last computed
- `next_allowed_client_refresh`: The earliest time when a client can request a fresh calculation

### Asynchronous queries

For asynchronous queries (like ones with `refresh: async`), the initial response includes a query status with its completion status, query ID, start time, and more:

```json
{
  "query_status": {
    "id": "2fbd4b19413342a4ad08c307155187bc",
    "team_id": 123,
    "complete": false
  }
}
```

You can then poll the status by sending a `GET` request to the `/api/projects/:project_id/query/:query_id/` endpoint.

```bash
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  <ph_app_host>/api/projects/:project_id/query/$QUERY_ID/
```

## Rate limits

API queries on our free plans are limited to:

- 1 query running concurrently
- 10,000 rows
- 1TB read bytes during query processing


Our ridiculously cheap plan lifts this to:

- 5 queries running concurrently

If you need higher limits than these, [get in touch with our sales team](/talk-to-a-human). We promise they're friendly and technical enough to know what an API is.

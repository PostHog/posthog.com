The events API is deprecated. If you're using the events API to export data, you need to migrate to [data pipeline batched exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) ASAP.

Currently, the events have the following restrictions imposed:

- Pagination `offset` values larger than 50000 are disabled
- If no `after` parameter is specified, only events in the last 24 hours are returned
- The maximum range between `before` and `after` is limited to **less than 1 year**

The API is due for removal at a future date, migrate to [data pipeline batched exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports).

This section of our Docs explains how to pull or push data from our API.

If you're looking to push event or user data into PostHog instead of using a tracking snippet or a language-specific library, there is a simple guide in the [Dedicated Events API](/docs/integrations/api) section.

PostHog has an API available on all tiers of pricing and for every self-hosted version.

## Authentication

Authentication is done via Basic Auth using your own username and password. We suggest creating a new user within your team specifically for this.

With `curl`:
```bash
curl -u username:password https://posthog.example.com/api/person/
```

As a header:
```bash
AUTH=$(echo -ne "username:password" | base64 --wrap 0)

curl \
  --header "Authorization: Basic $AUTH" \
  https://posthog.example.com/api/person/
```

**Important:** The API key in the Setup page is write-only and public. You cannot use that for any of these endpoints.

## /user

The [user endpoint](./user) gives you a lot of useful information about the possible event names and properties you can use throughout the rest of the API. 

## Pagination

Sometimes requests are paginated. If that's the case, it'll be in the following format:

```json
{
    "next": "https://posthog.example.com/api/person/?cursor=cD0yMjgxOTA2",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

In those cases, you can just call the "next" url to get the following set of results.

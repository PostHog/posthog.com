PostHog has a powerful API that enables you to capture, evaluate, create, update, and delete nearly all of your information in PostHog. You can use it to [pull information into your app](/tutorials/customer-facing-analytics), update metadata programmatically, [capture events from any language that can send HTTP requests](/tutorials/api-capture-events), and more.

The API is available for all users and instances. It contains two types of endpoints:

1. **Public POST-only endpoints** such as [`capture`](/docs/api/capture) and [`decide`](/docs/api/decide) are used for capturing events, batching events, updating person or group information, and evaluating feature flags. These don't require authentication, but use [your project API key](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) to handle the request.

2. **Private `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` endpoints** are used for [querying](/docs/api/query), creating, updating, or deleting nearly all data in PostHog. They give the same access as if you were logged into your PostHog instance, but require authentication with your personal API key. 

> You must make API requests to the correct domain. On US Cloud, these are `https://us.i.posthog.com` for public endpoints and `https://us.posthog.com` for private ones. On EU Cloud, these are `https://eu.i.posthog.com` for public endpoints and `https://eu.posthog.com` for private ones. For self-hosted instances, use your self-hosted domain. Confirm yours by checking your PostHog instance URL.

## Rate limiting

Private `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` endpoints are rate limited. Public POST-only endpoints are **not** rate limited. A rule of thumb for whether rate limits apply is if the personal API key is used for authentication. 

There are separate limits for different kinds of resources.

- For all analytics endpoints (such as calculating insights, retrieving persons, or retrieving session recordings), the rate limits are `240/minute` and `1200/hour`.

- The [`query`](/docs/api/query) endpoint has a rate limit of `120/hour`. This counts queries, rather than returned results. For large or regular exports of events, use [batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports).

- For [feature flag local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (which is enabled in SDKs when you input a personal API key), the rate limit is `600/minute`.

- For the rest of the create, read, update, and delete endpoints, the rate limits are `480/minute` and `4800/hour`.

- For public POST-only endpoints like event capture (`/capture`) and feature flag evaluation (`/decide`), there are no rate limits.

These limits apply to **the entire team** (i.e. all users within your PostHog organization). For example, if a script requesting feature flag metadata hits the rate limit, and another user, using a different personal API key, makes a single request to the persons API, this gets rate limited as well.

## Responses

### Status code: 200

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": 1
}
```

**Meaning:** A `200: OK` response means we have successfully received the payload, it is in the correct format, and the project API key (`api_key`) is valid. It **does not** imply that events are valid and will be ingested. As mentioned in [invalid events](/docs/api/capture#invalid-events), certain event validation errors may cause an event not to be ingested.

### Status code: 400

**Responses:**

```json
{
  "type": "validation_error", 
  "code": "invalid_project",
  "detail": "Invalid Project ID.",
  "attr": "project_id"
}
```

**Meaning:** We were unable to determine the project to associate the events with.

```json
{
  "type": "validation_error", 
  "code": "invalid_payload", 
  "detail": "Malformed request data", 
  "attr": null
}
```

**Meaning:** Request payload data formatted incorrectly.

### Status code: 401

**Responses:**

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_error",
  "code": "invalid_api_key",
  "detail": "Project API key invalid. You can find your project API key in PostHog project settings."
}
```

**Meaning:** The project API key you provided is invalid.

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_error",
  "code": "invalid_personal_api_key",
  "detail": "Invalid Personal API key."
}
```

**Meaning:** The personal API key you used for authentication is invalid.

### Status code: 503 (Deprecated)

**Response:**

```json
{
  "type": "server_error",
  "code": "fetch_team_fail",
  "detail": "Unable to fetch team from database."
}
```

**Meaning:** (Deprecated) This error only occurs in self-hosted Postgres instances if the database becomes unavailable. On ClickHouse-backed instances database failures cause events to be added to a dead letter queue, from which they can be recovered.

## Pagination

Requests are paginated if the results are higher than the limit, usually 100 (sometimes 500 or 1000). Pagination happens in the following format:

```json
{
  "next": "<ph_app_host>/api/person/?cursor=cD0yMjgxOTA2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

You can then just call the `"next"` URL to get the next set of results.

## Tips

- When logged in, you can view and download the API schema using the following options:
  - [Download the OpenAPI spec](https://app.posthog.com/api/schema/)
  - [View the API schema with Swagger UI](https://app.posthog.com/api/schema/swagger-ui/)
  - [View the API schema with Redoc](https://app.posthog.com/api/schema/redoc/)

- The [`/users/@me/` endpoint](/docs/api/user) gives you useful information about the current user.

- The `/api/event_definition/` and `/api/property_definition` endpoints provide the possible event names and properties you can use throughout the rest of the API.

- The maximum size of a POST request body is governed by `settings.DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`, and is 20MB by default.

- By default, the PostHog API returns results from the last project you visited in the UI. To override this behavior, you can pass in your project API key as a query parameter in the request like `api/event/?token=my_project_api_key`.

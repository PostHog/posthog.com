The `decide` endpoint is used to evaluate a feature flag for a given user. This means it is the main endpoint not only for feature flags, but also experimentation, early access features, and survey display conditions.

It is a POST-only public endpoint that uses your [project API key](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) and does not return any sensitive data from your PostHog instance.

> **Note:** Make sure to send API requests to the correct domain. These are `https://us.i.posthog.com` for US Cloud, `https://eu.i.posthog.com` for EU Cloud, and your self-hosted domain for self-hosted instances. Confirm yours by checking your URL from your PostHog instance.

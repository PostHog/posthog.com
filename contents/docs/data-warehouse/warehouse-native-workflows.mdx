This page explains how PostHog supports **warehouse-native workflows** with its integrated data warehouse, and what we mean (and don't mean) by "warehouse native."

> For the full "does PostHog do warehouse native?" answer, check out our [warehouse-native explainer](/warehouse-native).

## How it works

Data flows into PostHog and all query execution happens in PostHog:

1. **Getting data** – Events and persons are ingested into PostHog directly or via the PostHog SDK or an external CDP (e.g. Segment or RudderStack).
2. **Storing data** – Data is stored in PostHog infrastructure. We do not run your queries inside external data warehouses, such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks.
3. **Using data** – Analytics, experiments, feature flags, and other tools enable you to use the data that’s available in PostHog.

If you're using PostHog as your data warehouse, this makes PostHog **warehouse-native in practice**. You get SQL, unified data, and warehouse-style workflows, and data stays in your warehouse. 

If you're using an external data warehouse, such as Snowflake, PostHog still enables you to sync the data via our warehouse sources. 

For more detail on how data gets into PostHog and where queries run, see [Under the hood](/docs/data-warehouse/under-the-hood).

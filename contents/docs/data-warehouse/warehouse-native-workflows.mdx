This page explains how PostHog supports **warehouse-native workflows** with its integrated data warehouse, and what we mean (and don't mean) by "warehouse native."

> For the full "does PostHog do warehouse native?" answer, check out our [warehouse-native explainer](/warehouse-native).

## How it works

Data flows into PostHog and all query execution happens in PostHog:

1. **Getting data** – Events, persons, and external data is synced or ingested into PostHog either directly (as events), or via the [CDP](/cdp).
2. **Storing data** – Data is stored in PostHog infrastructure, either in ClickHouse or on a PostHog data warehouse. We do not run your queries inside your Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks.
3. **Using data** – Analytics, experiments, feature flags, and other tools use enable you to use the data that’s available in PostHog.

If you're using PostHog as your data warehouse, this makes PostHog **warehouse-native in practice**. You get SQL, unified data, and warehouse-style workflows, and data stays in your warehouse. 

If you're using an external data warehouse, such as Snowflake, PostHog still enables you to ingest the data via the CDP. 

For more detail on how data gets into PostHog and where queries run, see [Under the hood](/docs/data-warehouse/under-the-hood).

The PostHog data warehouse is accessed through [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql). 

### Managing your data sources

You can find your data sources in the [Data Warehouse tab](https://app.posthog.com/warehouse). On this page, you can view your PostHog generated tables and fields. You can also create, manage, view and delete external tables and their related fields.

The data warehouse can link to data in your object storage system like S3. To start, you'll need to:

1. Create a bucket in S3
2. Set up an access key and secret
3. Add data to the bucket (we'll use Airbyte)
4. Create the table in PostHog

### Step 1: Creating a bucket in S3

1. Log in to [AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Open [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/) in the AWS console and create a new bucket. We suggest `us-east-1` if you're using PostHog Cloud US, or `eu-central-1` if you're using PostHog Cloud EU.

> Make sure to note both the name and region of your bucket, we'll need these later.

### Step 2: Set up access policy and key

Next, we need to create a new user in our AWS console with programmatic access to our newly created bucket.

1. Open [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and create a new policy to enable access to this bucket
2. On the left under **Access management**, select **Policies** and click **Create policy**
3. Under the service, choose **S3**
4. Under **Actions**, select:
  1. **List** -> **ListBucket** and **ListBucketMultipartUploads**
  2. **Read** -> **GetBucketLocation** and **GetObject**
  2. **Write** -> **AbortMultipartUpload** and **PutObject**
  3. **Permission Management** -> **PutObjectAcl**
5. Under **Resources**, select **Specific**. Under object, click **Add ARNs**
6. Specify your bucket name and choose **Any object name**. In the example below, replace `posthog-s3-export` with the bucket name you chose in the previous section

7. Your policy in JSON should look like this:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:PutObject",
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:PutObjectAcl",
				"s3:ListBucket",
				"s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
				"s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
				"s3:GetBucketLocation"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::posthog-s3-export/*"
		}
	]
}
```

8. Click "Next" until you end up on the "Review Policy" page
9. Give your policy a name and click "Create policy"

The final step is to create a new user and give them access to our bucket by attaching our newly created policy.

1. Open [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and navigate to **Users** on the left
2. Click **Create user**, add a user name, and click **Next**
5. Select **Attach policies directly**
6. Search for the policy you just created and click the checkbox on the far left to attach it to this user
7. Click **Next** and then click **Create user**

8. Once created, search and click on the user name and then click **Create access key**
9. Select **Application running outside AWS** and then click **Next**
10. Add a description tag value and click **Create access key**
11. Copy the access key and secret access key values to somewhere safe. You will need to recreate these values if you lose them.

### Step 3: Add data to the bucket

> For this section, we'll be using **Airbyte**. However, we accept any data in [CSV](/tutorials/csv-query) or Parquet format, so if you already have data in S3 you can skip this section.

1. Go to [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Go to connections and click "New connection"
3. Select a source. For this example, we'll grab data from **Stripe**, but you can use any of Airbyte's sources.
4. Click "Set up a new destination"
5. Select "S3" as the destination
6. Fill in the "S3 Bucket Name", "S3 Bucket Region" with the name and region you created earlier.
7. For "S3 Bucket Path", use `airbyte`.
8. For the "Output Format", pick Parquet. You can use the default settings
9. Under "Optional fields", you'll want to add the access key and secret from step 1.
10. In the next step, pick the streams you want to fill. Given you'll manually need to create a table for each stream, we suggest being selective.
11. Wait for the sync to finish

### Step 4: Create the table in PostHog

1. Go to the [Data pipeline page](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/sources) and the sources tab in PostHog
2. Click **New source** and under self managed, look for **S3** and click **Link**
3. Fill in the table name.
4. For the URL pattern, copy the URL from S3, up to the bucket name. Replace the file name with `*`, as Airbyte will split larges streams out into multiple files.
    - For example: `https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/airbyte/invoices/*`
5. For file format, select Parquet. Fill in the access key and secret key.

> You'll want to repeat this step for each "stream" or folder that Airbyte created in your S3 bucket.

### Step 5: Query the table.

Amazing! You can now [query](/docs/data-warehouse/query) your new table.

## Troubleshooting

- **Create table failed: Could not get columns**: Check that your **Files URL pattern** is correct and that your file format is correct. For example, make sure your columns don't have spaces and there aren't commas in cells in your `.csv` file.

- **Create table failed: Access was denied when reading the provided file**: Make sure your access policies are correct.

- **Create table failed: The provided file is not in Parquet format**: Make sure you've selected the correct file format.

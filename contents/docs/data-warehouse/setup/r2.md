The data warehouse can link to data in Cloudflare R2. To start, you'll need to:

1. Create a bucket in R2
2. Set up an access key and secret
3. Add data to the bucket
4. Create the table in PostHog

## Step 1: Creating a bucket in R2

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Go to the R2 overview and create a new bucket. We suggest using **Eastern North America** as a location hint if you're using PostHog Cloud US or **European Union** as a specific jurisdiction if you're using PostHog Cloud EU.

3. In your bucket, upload the data you want to query such as CSV or Parquet data. It can be as simple as a `.csv` file like this:

```csv
id,name,email
1,John Doe,john@example.com
2,Jane Doe,jane@example.com
```

> **Adding data to R2 automatically:** See our [S3 docs](/docs/data-warehouse/setup/s3#step-3-add-data-to-the-bucket) for how to set up Airbyte to automatically add data to the bucket. You can also use other ETL tools like Fivetran or Stitch.

## Step 2: Create API tokens

1. Head back to the R2 overivew and under account details, click **Manage R2 API Tokens**
2. Click **Create API token**, give your token a name, choose **Object Read only** as the permission type, apply it to your bucket, and click **Create API Token**

3. Copy the credentials for S3 clients, including the **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, and jurisdiction-specific endpoint URL. These will not be shown again, so make sure to copy them to a safe place.

## Step 3: Create the table in PostHog

1. Go to the [Data pipeline page](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/sources) and the sources tab in PostHog
2. Click **New source** and under self managed, look for **Cloudflare R2** and click **Link**
3. Fill the table name, then use the data from Cloudflare: 
    - For files URL pattern, use the jurisdiction-specific endpoint URL with your bucket name and file name like `https://b27247d543c.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/posthog-warehouse/cool_data.csv`. You can also use `*` to query multiple files.
    - Chose the correct file format
    - For access key, use your Access Key ID
    - For secret key, use your Secret Access Key
4. Click **Next**

## Step 4: Query the table

Once it is done syncing, you can now [query](/docs/data-warehouse/query) your new table using the table name.

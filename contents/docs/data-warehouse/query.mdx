The data warehouse enables you to visualize and query data from external sources with PostHog's tools.

## Visualizing source data with trends

After [linking your source](/docs/data-warehouse/setup), you can use its data in a [trend](/docs/product-analytics/trends) like you would event or person data. 

To do this, create a [new insight](https://us.posthog.com/insights/new), click the series, go to the **Data warehouse tables** tab, hover over the table you want, and click **Select**.

The main difference from events is that you must identify 3 fields from the data warehouse data to visualize it:

- ID: A field that corresponds to the ID of the element. 
- Distinct ID: A field that corresponds to an ID representing the user associated with the element. If none, can match ID.
- Timestamp: A timestamp field representing when the element was created.
 
It's infeasible for us to map these fields. We pre-fill with a best guess, but allow you to edit it.

### Filters and breakdowns

When using data warehouse tables in insights, you can use properties from those tables filter and breakdown as you would with any other insight. For example, you could filter `zendesk_tickets` for ones where the `status` is `open` or `hubspot_companies` where `lifecyclestage` is `lead`.

## Querying sources with SQL

For more complicated queries, you can use [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql). 

To start, either create a [new SQL insight](https://us.posthog.com/insights/new) or go to the [data warehouse tab](https://us.posthog.com/data-warehouse). Here you can see the schemas all available external and PostHog tables as well as saved views

To see available sources, go to the [data pipeline page](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/sources). This page shows the external and PostHog tables as well as [saved views](/docs/data-warehouse/views) you can visualize with trends or query through [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql).

  alt="Data warehouse tab in PostHog app"

Here you can:

1. Write your SQL query using your table like `SELECT * FROM hubspot_contacts`
2. Click **Update and run** to see the results.
3. Modify your query using [SQL commands](/docs/product-analytics/sql) as needed to get the data you want like `SELECT email FROM hubspot_contacts WHERE city = 'Brisbane'`.
4. Save your query.

### Querying multiple sources together

Much of the power of the data warehouse comes from combining multiple sources, like your Stripe or Hubspot data with your product analytics data. Two of the easiest ways of doing this are `WHERE IN` and `JOIN` SQL commands.

For example, to get a count of events for your Hubspot contacts you can filter `events.distinct_id` by `email FROM hubspot_contacts` like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT() AS event_count, distinct_id
FROM events
WHERE distinct_id IN (SELECT email FROM hubspot_contacts)
GROUP BY distinct_id
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

You can also use a `JOIN` such as `INNER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` to combine data. For example, to get a count of events for your Stripe customers you can `INNER JOIN` on `distinct_id` and `email` like this:

```SQL
SELECT events.distinct_id, COUNT() AS event_count
FROM events
INNER JOIN prod_stripe_customer ON events.distinct_id = prod_stripe_customer.email
GROUP BY events.distinct_id
ORDER BY event_count DESC
```

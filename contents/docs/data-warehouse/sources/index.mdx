## PostHog data

Much of your PostHog data is available in the data warehouse by default. This includes data like events, persons, sessions, groups, and the query log. Learn how to [use PostHog as your data source](/docs/data-warehouse/sources/posthog).

## Managed sources

Provide your credentials and PostHog handles the entire extract and load process. Data syncs automatically from your source to PostHog's storage.

<ManagedSources />

## Self-managed sources

Upload CSV or Parquet files to your own object storage and link them as a source. PostHog reads directly from your storage on every query. You control data freshness and can store as much data as you want.

<SelfManagedSources />

You can also learn more about sources in the [data pipeline docs](/docs/cdp/sources).

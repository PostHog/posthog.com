## Strings and quotes

Quotation symbols work the same way they would work with ClickHouse, which inherits from ANSI SQL:

- **S**ingle quotes (`'`) for **S**trings literals.
- **D**ouble quotes (`"`) and **B**ackticks (\`) for **D**ata**B**ase identifiers.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM events WHERE properties.`$browser` = 'Chrome'
```

## Types

Types (and names) for the accessible data can be found in the [database](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/database), [properties](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/properties) tabs in data management as well as in the [SQL tab](https://us.posthog.com/sql) for external sources. They include:

- `STRING` (default)
- `JSON` (accessible with dot or bracket notation)
- `DATETIME`(in `ISO 8601`, [read more in our data docs](/docs/data/timestamps))
- `INTEGER`
- `FLOAT`
- `BOOLEAN`

For example:

```sql
SELECT round(properties.$screen_width * properties.$screen_height / 1000000, 2) as `Screen MegaPixels` FROM events LIMIT 100
```

This works because `$screen_width` and `$screen_height` are both defined as numeric properties. Thus you can multiply them.

To cast a string property into a different type, use type conversion functions, such as`toString`, `toDate`, `toFloat`, `JSONExtractString`, `JSONExtractInt`, and more.

## Property access

To access a property stored on an event or person, just use dot notation. For example `properties.$browser` or `person.properties.$initial_browser`. You can also use bracket notation like `properties['$feature/cool-flag']`.

Nested property or JSON access, such as `properties.$some.nested.property`, works as well.

> PostHog's properties include always include `$` as a prefix, while custom properties do not (unless you add it).

Property identifiers must be known at query time. For dynamic access, use the JSON manipulation functions from below on the `properties` field directly.

Some queries can error when accessing null values. To avoid this, use the `COALESCE` function to replace null values with a default value or filter `NULL` values with `IS NOT NULL` and use `assumeNotNull` to cast a column to a non-null type.

## Actions

To use [actions](/docs/data/actions) in SQL insights, use the `matchesAction()` function. For example, to get a count of the action `clicked homepage button`, you can do:

```sql
SELECT count() 
FROM events 
WHERE matchesAction('clicked homepage button')
```

For more customization when using actions, start by selecting you action in the [actions tab](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/actions) under data management.

In the action details under "Matching events," click the export dropdown and select "Edit SQL directly."

This opens an SQL insight using the action. You can then copy parts of the SQL, like the `WHERE` filter or columns under `SELECT`, to use in your own insights.

## Cohorts

To use [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) in SQL insights, simply filter where `person_id IN COHORT '{name}'`.

For example, to get a count of users in the `Power user` cohort:

```sql
select count()
from persons
where id IN COHORT 'Power users'
```

To get a count of events for users in the `Power user` cohort:

```sql
select count()
from events
where person_id IN COHORT 'Power user'
```

The real power of the data warehouse is the ability to combine data from multiple tables in a single query. Joins enable you to do this. They enable you to choose fields that act as connections between PostHog and external sources. 

## Table joins

You can join external data on existing PostHog schemas and other external data tables. These joins are saved and interpreted anytime they're accessed on the origin table. 

To define a join, go to the [data warehouse tab](https://us.posthog.com/data-warehouse), click the three dots next to your source table, and click **Add join**. Here you define the source table key, joining table, and joining table key as well as how the fields are accessed.

For example, if you import your Stripe data, you can define a join between the `events` table's `distinct_id` key and the `stripe_customer` table's `email` key. You can then access the `stripe_customer` table through the `events` table like `SELECT stripe_customer.id FROM events`.

Once joined, source properties can be used in filters, breakdowns, and [HogQL expressions](/docs/product-analytics/hogql).

To edit or delete a table join, click the three dots next to your source table, click **View table schema**, click the three dots next to your joined table, and select **Edit** or **Delete**.

## Person joins

Person joins are a special type of table joins. They are joins on the `persons` table in PostHog. When you join external data on this table, we enable you to use it like a person filter in insights.

> **Note:** Be sure that your joined keys actually match. For example `persons.id` returns a UUID, even if you use an email as a `distinct_id` when capturing events. You might need to add a person property  like `email`. 

## Query joins

If you only want to join data together for a single insight or query, you can use SQL commands like `WHERE IN` and `JOIN` SQL commands.

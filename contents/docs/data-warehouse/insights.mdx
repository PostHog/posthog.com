After [linking your source](/docs/cdp/sources), you can use its data in a [trend](/docs/product-analytics/trends) insight like you would event or person data. 

To do this, create a [new insight](https://us.posthog.com/insights/new), click the series, go to the **Data warehouse tables** tab, hover over the table you want, and click **Select**.

The main difference from events is that you must identify 3 fields from the data warehouse data to visualize it:

- ID: A field that corresponds to the ID of the element. 
- Distinct ID: A field that corresponds to an ID representing the user associated with the element. If none, can match ID.
- Timestamp: A timestamp field representing when the element was created.
 
It's infeasible for us to map these fields. We pre-fill with a best guess, but allow you to edit it.

## Filters and breakdowns

When using data warehouse tables in insights, you can use properties from those tables filter and breakdown as you would with any other insight. For example, you could filter `zendesk_tickets` for ones where the `status` is `open` or `hubspot_companies` where `lifecyclestage` is `lead`.

## Extended person properties

After setting up an join to the `persons` table, you can use the extended person properties of the joined table in filters, breakdowns, and more.

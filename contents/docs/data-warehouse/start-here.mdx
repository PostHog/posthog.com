  Data warehouse lets you store, query, and analyze your data in a unified platform, so you can build better products and make data-driven decisions.

  The first step is to link your first source to your data warehouse.

  ### Platforms

  Once you've linked a source, you can use as you would your other PostHog data in [trends](/docs/data-warehouse/insights). This makes setting up your first insights easy.

  You can use SQL to query data from your sources. We provide all sorts of [commands](/docs/data-warehouse/sql#commands) and [functions](/docs/data-warehouse/sql/useful-functions) to help you with this.
  
  After you've got the data you want, the SQL editor also provides a bunch of [visualizations](/docs/data-warehouse/query#sql-visualizations) for you to use too.

  subtitle="Recommended"

  The real power of the data warehouse is the ability to combine data from multiple tables in a single query. 
  
  [Joins](/docs/data-warehouse/join) enable you to do this by letting you choose fields that act as connections between PostHog and external sources.

In the PostHog data warehouse, you can save your most used queries as **views** and reference them in subsequent queries.

### Creating a view

Query views are created directly inside the HogQL editor. If the query has valid view characteristics, the "Save as view" button will be enabled. You will be prompted to give the view a name which will be the name that can be refeneced in other queries. For a query to be a valid view, all fields being accessed must be aliased. The alias names will be how you access the fields on the view. 

> **Note:** Currently, nested views are not supported. You cannot create a view based on other views only base PostHog models.

### Extending PostHog models with views

Views are a powerful tool for extending existing PostHog models for easier data access. For example, if you wanted to associate your Stripe customer data with product usage data of your users, you would normally need to manually set up a join. With views, you can attach views to PostHog models so that you can directly access those fields on the PostHog table. 

The view link prompt is on the data warehouse page under the PostHog tab.

Push data from PostHog to Databricks, once every minute. The app creates a table and migrates data from DBFS to a database.

## Requirements

Using this app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

## Configuration

This app sets all specified properties on ingested events to `null`, effectively preventing PostHog from collecting information you do not want it to use.

It is [used by teams such as WittyWorks to protect user privacy](https://posthog.com/customers/wittyworks) by removing unneeded geographic data.

## Requirements

The Property Filter app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

## Installation

1. Log in to your PostHog instance
2. Click 'Apps' on the left-hand tool bar
3. Search for 'Property Filter' press 'Install'
4. Configure the by app by following the onscreen instructions.

It's important to note that this app effectively removes information from PostHog events by setting properties to `null`. Apps on PostHog run in sequence, so it usually makes sense to place this app at the _end_ of a sequence.

Note: If you are filtering `$ip`, `event.ip` will also be set to null.

## Does this filter properties for retrospective events?

No. The Property Filter app will only work on events ingested _after_ it was enabled.

The SemVer Flattener splits a valid SemVer version into the following 

```
export interface VersionParts {
    major: number
    minor: number
    patch?: number
    preRelease?: string
    build?: string
}
```

And then flattens them onto an event. So, this...

```
{
    properties: {
        app_version: '22.7.11'
    }
}
```

Becomes this...


```
{
    properties: {
        app_version: '22.7.11'
        app_version__major: 22,
        app_version__minor: 7,
        app_version__patch: 11
    }
}
```

This is especially helpful for comparing versions when filtering in PostHog insights, as it isn't possible to correctly use string comparison in all situations.

## FAQ

## Why aren't my conversions appearing inside of Google Ads?

Note that it might take around 6-48 hours for Google to process conversions and make them visible inside of Google Ads. Additionally you'll need to wait around 6 hours before new conversion goals will accept incoming data. 

### Is the source code for this destination available?

PostHog is open-source and so are all the destination on the platform. The [source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/cdp/templates/google_ads/template_google_ads.py) is available on GitHub.

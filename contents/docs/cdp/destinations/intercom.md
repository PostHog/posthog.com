## Configuration details

The Intercom destination requires that contacts **already exist** in Intercom before you can send events associated with them.

You can use the Intercom contact creation destination to ensure those records exist. It is pre-configured to fire on [identify](/docs/product-analytics/identify) events, enabling Intercom to capture the same information on each user that PostHog does.

   1. If youâ€™ve already set up a Pixel for your website, we recommend that you use the same Pixel ID for your browser and server events.
      1. To create a new Pixel, click **Pixels** and then click **Create Pixel** button.
      2. Choose a name for your Pixel, and then click **Create**.
   2. Go to your Pixel by clicking **Pixels** and then click the Pixel you want to use.
   3. Copy the Pixel ID.

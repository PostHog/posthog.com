Send event and emails data from PostHog into Sendgrid whenever a user is identified in PostHog.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud with the data pipeline add-on, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need Sendgrid access, obviously.

2. Search for 'Sendgrid' and select the app, press Install.
3. Add your Sendgrid API key at the configuration step.

This app enables you to publish events to Memphis as they are ingested into PostHog. [Memphis](https://memphis.dev) is an alternative to traditional message brokers and a real-time data processing platform.    

## Requirements

This app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need to have a Memphis account. 

## Install

1. Access PostHog's Apps page from the sidebar.
2. Search for Memphis to find the app, and press install. Alternatively, you can install directly from the repo via the Advanced tab by fetching the following URL: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-memphisdev-app.
3. Configure the plugin by entering your Memphis credentials and station details.
4. Watch events roll into your station!

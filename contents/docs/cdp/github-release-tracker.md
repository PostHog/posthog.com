This app enables you to tracker releases in GitHub as events in PostHog. This is useful for correlating releases with user behaviour or performance issues, for example.

## Requirements

The GitHub Release Tracker requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

If you want to track releases from a private GitHub repo, you'll also need access to it.

## Installation

1. Log in to your PostHog instance
2. Click 'Apps' on the left-hand tool bar
3. Search for 'GitHub Release Tracker'
4. Select the app, press 'Install' and follow the on-screen instructions

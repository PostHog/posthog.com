Send event data from PostHog into Customer.io. User emails will also be sent if available and customers will be created in Customer.io.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need access to the relevant Customer.io account.

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'Customer.io' and select the app, press Install.
3. Add your Customer.io site ID and token at the configuration step.
4. Enable the app and watch your 'People' list get populated in Customer.io!

## Configuration

### How do I match persons in PostHog with customers in Customer.io?

We assume that you use the same ID to identify users in Customer.io as you use as distinct_id or in `posthog.identify()`.

### How do I set properties on a Customer.io customer via PostHog?

PostHog will send any property inside the `$set: {}` property to customer.io. In the example below, `email` and `userProperty` will be set on the customer

```js
posthog.capture(
  'some event',
  {
    event_property: 'this will not get sent',
    $set: {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      userProperty: 'value'
    }
  }
)
```

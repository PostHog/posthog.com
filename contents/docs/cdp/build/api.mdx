title: Using the PostHog API
---

All apps have access to a global helper object `posthog`, which provides easy access to the PostHog API.

The global `posthog` object contains the following interfaces:
- [`capture`](#capture) - Send additional events from an app
- [`api`](#api) - Access the PostHog API from an app

## `capture`

> **Warning:** Be very careful when calling `posthog.capture` from `processEvent` or `onEvent`! The event captured will also be run through all the installed apps and could potentially lead to an infinite loop of event generation.

Calling `posthog.capture` allows you to capture a new event under the same project the app is running in.

```ts
capture(event: string, properties?: Record<string, any>) => void
```

It takes 2 arguments, the first one being an event name (required), and the second one being an object with properties to set on the event (optional).

Apps can pass `distinct_id` on the event properties to specify what user the event should be attributed to. If `distinct_id` is not specified, the event will be attributed to a generic "App Server" person.

Apps can optionally pass a `timestamp`, which needs to be in ISO 8601 format. If not set, the timestamp will default to current time.

##### Example usage

```ts
posthog.capture('stripe_customer_subscribed', {
  distinct_id: 'a user id',
  timestamp: new Date(subscription.created*1000).toISOString()
})
```

## `api`

The `posthog.api` object contains a number of methods that make interacting with the PostHog API much easier.

`posthog.api` gives you access to the following 4 methods, which each correspond to the 4 HTTP methods used to access the API.

```ts
get(path: string, options?: ApiMethodOptions): Promise<Response>
post(path: string, options?: ApiMethodOptions): Promise<Response>
put(path: string, options?: ApiMethodOptions): Promise<Response>
delete(path: string, options?: ApiMethodOptions): Promise<Response>
```

By default, all these methods will create a temporary access token that the app uses to access the API.

> **Warning:** Be very careful when using `posthog.api.post` to send events from `processEvent` or `onEvent`! The event captured will also be run through all the installed apps and could potentially lead to an infinite loop of event generation.

#### Sending an API request

It's best to look at an example to see how these methods work in practice. Here, we're looking to create a new annotation from within our app.

```ts
const res = await posthog.api.post(
  '/api/projects/@current/annotations',
  {
    data: {
      content: 'New Annotation',
      scope: 'organization',
      date_marker: '2022-09-22T07:30:00Z',
    },
    host: 'https://posthog.mydomain.com' // defaults to https://app.posthog.com if not specified
  }
)
```

As you can see, when specifying the path of our API route, we can use the `@current` identifier in place of our project ID in order to let the API know we want to access the project the app is currently running in.

We've also specified the host of our PostHog instance. This is only necessary when running an app on a self-hosted instance, and when using PostHog Cloud this can be omitted.

```js
const body = await res.json()
```

Keep in mind that these functions will return the raw response object in a Promise, so in order to access the body, you can simply call the `.json()` method.

#### Customizing options

You can override these defaults to interact with another PostHog project or instance.

The options available are:

```ts
interface ApiMethodOptions {
    // any data to send with the request, GET and DELETE will set these as URL params
    data?: Record<string, any>

    // posthog host, defaults to https://app.posthog.com
    host?: string

    // specifies the project to interact with
    projectApiKey?: string

    // authenticates the user
    personalApiKey?: string
}
```

> **Tip:** When using `@current` you don't need to specify `projectApiKey` or `personalApiKey`.

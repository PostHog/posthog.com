This app prevents duplicate events from being ingested into PostHog. It's particularly helpful if you're backfilling information while you're already ingesting ongoing events.

## How it works

The Unduplicator crafts an event UUID based on key properties for the event, so if the event is the same (see below for definition) it'll end with the same UUID.

When events are processed by ClickHouse, the database will automatically dedupe events which have the same `toDate(timestamp)`, `event`, `distinct_id` and `uuid` combo, effectively making sure duplicates are not stored.

The app has two modes that define what's considered a duplicate event. Either mode will prevent duplicates within a project, though duplicates across projects are still permitted.

-   **Event and Timestamp**. An event will be treated as duplicate if the timestamp, event name and user's distinct ID matches exactly, regardless of what internal properties are included.
-   **All Properties**. An event will be treated as duplicate only if all properties match exactly, as well as the timestamp, event name and user's distinct ID.

## Requirements

The Unduplicator requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

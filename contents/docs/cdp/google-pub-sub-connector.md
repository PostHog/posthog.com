> This app is currently unavailable while we develop [a new export system](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/15997). It will be back again soon!

This app sends events from PostHog to a [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) topic when they are ingested. It's [used by teams such as Vendasta](https://posthog.com/customers/vendasta).

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need a Google Cloud Pub/Sub account to connect to.

## Installation

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'Pub/Sub' and select the app, press Install.
3. Upload your Google Cloud key .json file. ([How to get the file.](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries))
4. Enter your Topic ID.
5. Watch events publish to Topic.

## Finding your Google Cloud key .json file

You'll need this file to configure the Pub/Sub app for PostHog. You can find out where to find it in [Google's Pub/Sub client libraries documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries).

This source enables you to send events to PostHog, via RudderStack.

RudderStack is an open-source, customer data platform for developers. It allows you to collect and deliver customer event data to a variety of destinations across your growth, product, and marketing stack.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need access to a RudderStack workspace.

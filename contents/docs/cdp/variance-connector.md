This app exports PostHog data to Variance in real-time and formats it for use by revenue teams. This includes extracting accounts and contacts, making it easy to see customers by sales stage, and more.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.31.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-31-0) or later. The app supports `capture`, `page`, `identify`, and `alias` calls.

Not running 1.31.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

## Installation

To install the Variance app you'll need a Variance account. In your Variance account go to Variance > Integrations > Create a new PostHog connection. This will give you a Webhook URL and Authorization header value. You will then use those two values when installing the app in your PostHog instance. Don't forget to hit enable after you've added the configuration details.

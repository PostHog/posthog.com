> This app is currently unavailable while we develop [a new export system](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/15997). It will be back again soon!

Export events from PostHog to a PostgreSQL instance on ingestion.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need access to the PostgreSQL instance you want to export to.

## Installation

Firstly, make sure that PostHog can access your PostgreSQL instance. Wherever your instance is hosted, make sure it is set to accept incoming connections so that PostHog can connect to the database and insert events. If this is not possible in your case, consider using the S3 Export app and then setting up your own system for getting data into your Postgres instance.

You will also need to create a user with table creation privileges in your PostgreSQL instance, as well as a new table to store events and execute INSERT queries. You can and should block PostHog from doing anything else on any other tables. Giving PostHog table creation permissions should be enough to ensure this:

```
CREATE USER posthog WITH PASSWORD '123456yZ';
GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE your_database TO posthog;
```

Finally, follow the steps below.

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'PostgreSQL' and select the app, press Install.
3. Add the connection details at the plugin configuration step in PostHog.

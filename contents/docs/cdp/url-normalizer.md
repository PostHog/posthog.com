This app normalizes the format of URLs so you can more easily compare them in insights.

By default, the URL Normalizer converts all URLs to lowercase and strips trailing /s, overriding the old `current_url` property.

## Requirements

The URL Normalizer app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

## Installation

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'URL Normalizer' and select the app, press Install.

## Configuration

No configuration is needed. The URL Normalizer will automatically convert all URLs to lowercase and remove any trailing slashes.

If you'd like to normalize URLs into a different format, please consider contributing a PR to [the repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-url-normalizer-plugin).

The Heartbeat app simply sends one event to your project every minute for as long as it is enabled. It's mainly useful for testing and works well in conjunction with the Ingestion Alert app.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

> This app is currently unavailable while we develop [a new export system](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/15997). It will be back again soon!

Send events from PostHog to a Google Cloud Storage bucket upon ingestion.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket you want to export to.

## Installation

Before installing the Google Cloud Storage Export app, you will need your Google Cloud .json file. Find out how to get this in [Google's BigQuery API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries).

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'GCS' and select the app, press Install and proceed to Configuration.
3. Upload your Google Cloud key .json file.
4. Enter your Project ID.
5. Enter your bucket name.

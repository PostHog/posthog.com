Send events from PostHog, to RudderStack. RudderStack will recognize PostHog as a data source, so you can use RudderStack's data pipeline features to send PostHog event data to other platforms.

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need access to the Rudderstack instance you want to export to.

## Installation

First, create a PostHog source in your RudderStack dashboard. Need help? Check [RudderStack's documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs) for more information.

Once you've added PostHog as a source, make a note of the `write-key` field and your RudderStack server URL (also called the Data Planer URL).

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'Rudderstack' and select the app, press Install.
3. Follow the on-screen steps to configure the app, entering your `write-key` and server URL information.

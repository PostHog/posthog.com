<AlphaRelease />

The tinyEmail connector syncs your email marketing data – campaigns, contact lists, contact members, and sender details – into PostHog, so you can analyze campaign performance and audience growth alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a tinyEmail account on an Enterprise plan, since tinyEmail restricts API access to Enterprise accounts. If you're on a lower tier, contact tinyEmail about upgrading before connecting.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking tinyEmail, you'll need:

- **API key** – in [tinyEmail](https://app.tinyemail.com), go to **My account > API keys** and generate a new key.

The tinyEmail API allows 60 requests per minute per API key. PostHog automatically backs off and retries when this limit is hit, but if you have very large contact lists you can ask tinyEmail support to raise the limit.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

The tinyEmail API doesn't offer a way to filter records by modification time, so all tables sync as full refresh.

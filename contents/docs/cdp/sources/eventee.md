<AlphaRelease />

The Eventee connector syncs your event's content into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your event program alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need an Eventee account with admin access so you can generate an API token. The token is scoped to a single event, so connect one source per event you want to import.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Eventee, you'll need:

- **API token** – generate one in your Eventee admin dashboard under **Settings → Features**. The token is scoped to a single event.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Eventee tables are full refresh only, since the API exposes no incremental sync filter.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error, your Eventee API token is invalid or has expired. Generate a new token in your Eventee admin dashboard (**Settings → Features**), then reconnect.
- If you get a permission error, your token does not have access to this event's data. Check the token in your Eventee admin dashboard, then reconnect.

<AlphaRelease />

The Skyvern connector syncs workflows, runs, schedules, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Skyvern API key to automatically pull your Skyvern browser-automation data.

You can find your API key in your [Skyvern settings](https://app.skyvern.com/settings).

If you self-host Skyvern, set the base URL to your deployment (for example `http://localhost:8000`). Leave it blank to use Skyvern Cloud.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Some Skyvern tables sync incrementally, so later runs only fetch new or updated rows. The rest are full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

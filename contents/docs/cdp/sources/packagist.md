<AlphaRelease />

The Packagist connector syncs packages, versions, downloads, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

None. The Packagist API is public, so no account or API key is needed.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Pull metadata, download statistics, and security advisories for PHP packages from [Packagist](https://packagist.org) (the Composer package registry).

Packagist's read APIs are public, so no credentials are required. Enter the packages you want to track, one per line (or comma-separated), as `vendor/package` names. A bare vendor name syncs every package published by that vendor. For example:

```
monolog/monolog
symfony/console
yourvendor
```

Download statistics sync incrementally per day; the other tables sync as a full refresh.

You'll be asked for:

- **Packages**: for example `monolog/monolog
symfony/console
yourvendor`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Some Packagist tables sync incrementally, so later runs only fetch new or updated rows. The rest are full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

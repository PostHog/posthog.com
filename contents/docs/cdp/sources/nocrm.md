<AlphaRelease />

The noCRM.io connector syncs leads, activities, users, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your noCRM.io account subdomain and API key to automatically pull your noCRM.io data.

Your subdomain is the first part of your noCRM.io URL - for `acme.nocrm.io`, enter `acme`.

You can create an API key as an account admin under **Admin panel → API & Webhooks → API keys**. The key is account-level and grants read access to leads, users, teams, pipelines and the other tables listed below.

You'll be asked for:

- **Subdomain**: for example `acme`.
- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Some noCRM.io tables sync incrementally, so later runs only fetch new or updated rows. The rest are full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Pexels connector syncs curated photos, popular videos, featured collections, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Pexels API key to pull Pexels stock photo and video catalog data.

Generate an API key from your [Pexels API dashboard](https://www.pexels.com/api/).

Attribution to Pexels and to the photographer/videographer is required when you use Pexels content - see the [Pexels API guidelines](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/#guidelines).

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `Your Pexels API key`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Pexels tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

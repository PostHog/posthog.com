<AlphaRelease />

The Lovable connector syncs workspaces, projects, workspace members, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Connect your Lovable account with an API key to sync workspaces, projects, members, credit history, and security findings. Member, collaborator, credit, and PII tables need Lovable's Enterprise plan, and security scans need Business or higher.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `lov_...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Lovable tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Pardot connector syncs prospects, prospect accounts, lists, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Connect Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (formerly Pardot) to pull your marketing data.

Connect a Salesforce account that has access to Account Engagement, then enter the ID of the business unit you want to sync.

You'll be asked for:

- **Salesforce account**
- **Environment**: choose sandbox if your business unit belongs to a sandbox, demo or developer org.
- **Business unit ID**: the 18-character ID starting with `0Uv`, in Salesforce Setup under Account Engagement Business Unit Setup.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Pardot tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the salesforce account is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

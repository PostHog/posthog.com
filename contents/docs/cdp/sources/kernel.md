<AlphaRelease />

[Kernel](https://www.kernel.sh) is browser infrastructure for AI agents. This connector syncs your Kernel apps, deployments, action invocations, cloud browser sessions, and saved profiles into the PostHog data warehouse so you can join agent run history with your product data.

## Prerequisites

A Kernel account with an API key. Kernel API keys are long-lived and grant organization-wide read access.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

You need a Kernel API key. Create one in your [Kernel dashboard](https://dashboard.onkernel.com) under API keys, then paste it into the connection form.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Kernel tables sync in full-refresh mode. Incremental sync is not yet available for this connector.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

If the connection fails with an authentication error, confirm the API key is active in your Kernel dashboard and has not been revoked. Kernel enforces per-organization rate limits, so very large syncs may take longer while the connector backs off and retries.

<AlphaRelease />

The Sonar Cloud connector syncs projects, issues, metrics, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your SonarQube Cloud user token and organization key to sync code-quality data.

Generate a **user token** under **My Account → Security** in SonarQube Cloud, and find your **organization key** on your organization's homepage.

You'll be asked for:

- **User token**
- **Organization key**: for example `my-organization`.
- **Region**: choose between EU (sonarcloud.io) and US (sonarqube.us).

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Sonar Cloud tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the user token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

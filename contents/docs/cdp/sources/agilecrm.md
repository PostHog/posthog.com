<AlphaRelease />

The AgileCRM connector syncs your CRM data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your contacts, deals, and sales activity alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need an Agile CRM account with API access so you can generate an API key. You authenticate with the email address you log in with and that key.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking AgileCRM, you'll need:

- **Domain** – the subdomain of your Agile CRM URL. For `https://acme.agilecrm.com` the domain is `acme`.
- **Email** – the email address you use to log in to Agile CRM.
- **API key** – find it under **Admin Settings → Developers & API** in your Agile CRM account.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All AgileCRM tables are full refresh only, since the API exposes no incremental sync filter.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error, your Agile CRM email or API key is invalid. Generate a new API key under **Admin Settings → Developers & API**, then reconnect.
- If you get a permission error, your Agile CRM account does not have access to this data. Check your API access settings, then reconnect.

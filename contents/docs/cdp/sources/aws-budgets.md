<AlphaRelease />

The AWS Budgets connector syncs budgets, budget performance history, notifications, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync your AWS budgets, their spend history, and their alert thresholds.

Create an IAM user or role with the `budgets:DescribeBudgets`, `budgets:DescribeBudgetPerformanceHistory` and `budgets:DescribeNotificationsForBudget` permissions, then paste its access key ID and secret access key. Add a session token too if you are using temporary credentials.

AWS Budgets is a global service, so there is no region to pick. PostHog looks up which account the credentials belong to and reads that account's budgets.

You'll be asked for:

- **AWS access key ID**: for example `AKIA...`.
- **AWS secret access key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All AWS Budgets tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the AWS access key ID is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Workday connector syncs workers, jobs, job profiles, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Pull your Workday HCM data over the Workday REST API.

Register an API client for integrations in Workday (**Register API Client for Integrations**) with the `staffing` scope, then paste its client ID, client secret and refresh token below.

Your hostname and tenant are the first two parts of your Workday URL - for `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/acme_pt1`, the hostname is `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com` and the tenant is `acme_pt1`.

You'll be asked for:

- **Hostname**: for example `wd2-impl-services1.workday.com`.
- **Tenant**: for example `acme_pt1`.
- **Client ID**
- **Client secret**
- **Refresh token**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Workday tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the client secret is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Kalshi connector syncs markets, events, series, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

None. The Kalshi API is public, so no account or API key is needed.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Kalshi's market data endpoints are public, so this source needs no API key.

It syncs markets, events, series, trades, and milestones. Portfolio data (your own orders, fills, and positions) needs a signed API key and is not supported yet.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Some Kalshi tables sync incrementally, so later runs only fetch new or updated rows. The rest are full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

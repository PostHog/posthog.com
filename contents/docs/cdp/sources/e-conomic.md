<AlphaRelease />

The e-conomic connector syncs your Visma e-conomic accounting data into PostHog, so you can analyze your financials alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Visma e-conomic agreement and an app registered in the e-conomic Developer portal, so you can obtain both authentication tokens.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking e-conomic, you'll need:

- **App secret token** – your app's secret, from the [e-conomic Developer portal](https://www.e-conomic.com/developer).
- **Agreement grant token** – issued when an e-conomic user grants your app access to their agreement.

Both tokens grant read access to the whole agreement. e-conomic has no per-resource scopes.

## Troubleshooting

- If your tokens are invalid or have been revoked, check your app secret token and agreement grant token, then reconnect.
- If your tokens do not have access to some data, re-grant the app access to the agreement, then reconnect.

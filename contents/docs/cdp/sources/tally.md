<AlphaRelease />

The Tally connector syncs workspaces, forms, questions, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter a Tally API key to sync your workspaces, forms, folders, questions, submissions, form analytics, and webhooks.

You can create an API key in your [Tally settings](https://tally.so/settings/api-keys). No extra scopes are needed.

Submissions are fetched one form at a time and Tally allows 100 requests per minute, so the first sync of an account with many forms can take a while.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `tly-...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Tally tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

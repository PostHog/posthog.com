<AlphaRelease />

The Omni Analytics connector syncs your [Omni](https://omni.co/) workspace data into PostHog, so you can analyze your BI documents, folders, connections, schedules, users, and user groups alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need an Omni Analytics account with API access. You can use either an **Organization API key** or a **Personal Access Token**, but Organization API keys provide broader coverage:

- **Organization API key** – access all tables, including Users and User groups (SCIM endpoints). Create one under **Settings > API access** in Omni.
- **Personal Access Token** – access most tables, but can't read Users or User groups. Only sees content the token owner can access.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Omni Analytics, you'll need:

- **Instance URL** – your Omni instance URL, for example `https://your-company.omniapp.co`.
- **API key** – an Organization API key or Personal Access Token from your Omni account.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

The Documents table supports incremental sync via the `updatedAt` field. All other tables are full refresh only, since the Omni API doesn't expose incremental sync filters for them.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error, your API key is invalid or expired. Generate a new key in Omni under **Settings > API access** and reconnect.
- If you get a permission error, your API key doesn't have access to the requested data. Check the key's permissions and try again.
- If the Users or User groups tables fail, make sure you're using an Organization API key. Personal Access Tokens can't access SCIM user and group endpoints.
- If PostHog can't reach your Omni instance, check that the Instance URL is correct and points to your Omni deployment.

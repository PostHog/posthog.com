<AlphaRelease />

The lemlist connector syncs your sales outreach data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your campaigns alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a lemlist account so you can generate an API key.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Lemlist, you'll need:

- **API key** – generate an API key in your lemlist **Settings > Integrations** page.

## Sync modes

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your lemlist API key may be invalid or revoked. Generate a new key in lemlist Settings > Integrations, then reconnect.
- If you see a permission error, your lemlist account may be blocked from API access. Check your lemlist account status, then reconnect.

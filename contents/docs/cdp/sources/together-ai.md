<AlphaRelease />

The Together AI connector syncs your fine-tuning jobs, batch inference jobs, uploaded files, dedicated endpoints, evaluations, and the model catalog into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your AI training and inference operations alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Together AI account with an API key. Together AI requires a payment method on file before API keys can make requests.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Together AI, you'll need:

- **API key** – find or create one under [Settings → API keys](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys) in your Together AI account.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Together AI's list endpoints don't support timestamp filtering, so all tables sync with full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API key is invalid or has been revoked. Create a new key in your Together AI settings, then reconnect.
- Usage and billing data isn't available through Together AI's public API, so it can't be synced. It's only visible in the Together AI dashboard.

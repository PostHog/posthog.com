<AlphaRelease />

The Thinkific connector syncs your course, enrollment, and order data into PostHog, so you can analyze your online learning business alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Thinkific account with admin access so you can create an API key.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Thinkific, you'll need:

- **API key** – create one under **Settings → Code & analytics → API** in your Thinkific admin.
- **Subdomain** – the `<subdomain>` part of your `<subdomain>.thinkific.com` admin URL.

## Sync modes

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

## Troubleshooting

- If your API key or subdomain is invalid, create a new API key in your Thinkific admin (Settings → Code & analytics → API) and confirm the subdomain, then reconnect.
- If your API key does not have permission to access some data, check the key in your Thinkific admin, then reconnect.

<AlphaRelease />

The Metabase connector pulls your Metabase data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your Metabase content and metadata alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Metabase instance and credentials with read access to the data you want to sync. To use an API key, your instance must be Metabase v0.47 or newer; older instances can authenticate with a username and password instead.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Metabase, you'll need:

- **Instance URL** – your Metabase instance's public URL, for example `https://your-company.metabaseapp.com`.
- **Authentication method** – choose one of the following:
  - **API key** – create one in Metabase under **Admin settings > Authentication > API keys** (Metabase v0.47+). The key needs read access to the data you want to sync.
  - **Username & password** – the email and password of a Metabase user with read access to the data you want to sync.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your credentials may be invalid or expired. Update them and reconnect.
- If you see a permissions error, grant the API key or user read access to the data you want to sync, then reconnect.
- If the host is rejected, use your instance's public URL.

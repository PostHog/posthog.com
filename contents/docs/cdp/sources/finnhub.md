<AlphaRelease />

The Finnhub connector pulls market and company financial data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze financial metrics alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Finnhub account so you can create an API key. A free key works, though the free tier is rate limited to 60 requests per minute and some endpoints require a paid plan.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Finnhub, you'll need:

- **API key** – create a free API key in your [Finnhub dashboard](https://finnhub.io/dashboard).
- **Symbols** – optional, comma-separated. Per-company tables (company profile, quote, company news, basic financials, recommendation trends, and earnings surprises) are synced for each ticker you list here, for example `AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL`. Market-wide tables sync without any symbols.
- **Exchange** – optional. Used for the stock symbols table, for example `US`.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API key may be invalid or revoked. Create a new key in your Finnhub dashboard, then reconnect.
- If a table fails with a forbidden error, your plan may not include access to that data. Upgrade your plan or deselect the affected tables, then reconnect.

<AlphaRelease />

The Algolia connector syncs your Algolia search data – index records, synonyms, query rules, and indices – into PostHog, so you can analyze your search configuration alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need an Algolia account with access to your Application ID and the ability to create an API key with the ACLs for the data you want to sync.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Algolia, you'll need:

- **Application ID** – found in your [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys/all) under your account API keys.
- **API key** – create one in the same [Algolia dashboard](https://dashboard.algolia.com/account/api-keys/all). Grant the ACLs for the data you want to sync: `browse` for index records, `settings` for synonyms and query rules, and `listIndexes` for the list of indices.
- **Index name** – the name of the Algolia index you want to sync.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Algolia endpoints do not expose a server-side updated-since filter, so this source is full refresh only.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, check that your Application ID and API key are correct in the Algolia dashboard.
- If a table fails to sync, make sure your API key has the ACL required for it: `browse` for records, `settings` for synonyms and query rules, and `listIndexes` for indices.

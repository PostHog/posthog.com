<AlphaRelease />

The Xendit connector syncs transactions, accounts, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Xendit secret API key to sync your Xendit data.

Create a key in the Xendit dashboard under **Settings > Developers > API keys**. Give it the **Transaction Read** permission to sync transactions, and **Accounts Read** if you also want to sync xenPlatform sub-accounts.

You'll be asked for:

- **Secret API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Xendit tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the secret API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The JumpCloud connector syncs users, systems, user groups, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your JumpCloud admin API key to sync your directory and activity data.

Find your API key in the JumpCloud Admin Portal: click your account initials in the top-right corner and select **My API Key**.

The `events` table requires a Directory Insights subscription. If you're an MSP/MTP admin managing multiple organizations, also enter the organization ID the key should act on.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**
- **Region**: choose between US (console.jumpcloud.com) and EU (console.eu.jumpcloud.com).

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All JumpCloud tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

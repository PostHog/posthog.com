<AlphaRelease />

The Google Play Console connector syncs crash rate, anr rate, excessive wakeup rate, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync Android vitals and error reporting from the Play Developer Reporting API: crash and ANR rates, excessive wakeups and stuck wakelocks, slow starts and slow rendering, low-memory kills, plus error issues, error reports, and the anomalies Play detects.

To connect, create a Google Cloud service account and enable the **Play Developer Reporting API** in its project. Then, in Play Console under **Users and permissions**, invite the service account's email and give it access to view app quality data. Upload that service account's JSON key below.

Leave the package names blank to sync every app the service account can see.

You'll be asked for:

- **Google service account JSON key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Google Play Console tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the google service account JSON key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

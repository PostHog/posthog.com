<AlphaRelease />

The Trino connector runs read-only SQL against the catalogs your Trino user can reach, so you can bring data from the systems behind Trino into PostHog.

## Prerequisites

A Trino cluster PostHog can reach over the network, and a user with read access to the catalog and schemas you want to sync.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

- **Host** and **Port**: your Trino coordinator, for example `trino.example.com` on port `443`.
- **Catalog**: the catalog to read from, for example `hive`.
- **Schema**: optional. Leave blank to include every schema in the catalog.
- **Authentication type**: choose password, JWT token, or no authentication, to match how your cluster authenticates.
- **Use HTTPS?** and **Verify TLS certificate?**: keep both on unless your cluster serves plain HTTP or uses a self-signed certificate.

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, check the authentication type matches your cluster, and that the user and password or JWT are current.
- If PostHog cannot reach the coordinator, check that your network allows connections from the PostHog IP addresses below.

<AlphaRelease />

The Rootly connector syncs your incident-management data into PostHog, so you can analyze incidents and reliability data alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Rootly account with an API key. A Global-scope key can read every resource; Team- and User-scope keys only see the resources they are granted.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Rootly, you'll need:

- **API key** – create one in your [Rootly account settings](https://rootly.com/account/api_keys). Use a Global-scope key to read every resource, or grant a narrower-scoped key access to the resources you want to sync.

## Troubleshooting

- If your API key is invalid or has been revoked, create a new API key in your Rootly account settings, then reconnect.
- If your key is missing access to a resource, grant the key access in your Rootly account settings, then reconnect.

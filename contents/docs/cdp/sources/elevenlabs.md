<AlphaRelease />

The ElevenLabs connector syncs your AI audio data into the PostHog Data warehouse: speech generation history, conversational AI conversations and agents, voices, and models. Use it to analyze generation volume, character costs, and agent call outcomes alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need an ElevenLabs account with an API key. API keys are available on every plan.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking ElevenLabs, you'll need:

- **API key** – create one in your ElevenLabs account under [Profile → API keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys). If you restrict the key's permissions, grant read access to the endpoints you want to sync: **History**, **Conversational AI**, **Voices**, **Models**, and **User** (used to verify the key).

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

The `history` and `conversations` tables support incremental sync using their creation timestamps. The `agents`, `voices`, and `models` tables are full refresh only.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your ElevenLabs API key may be invalid, revoked, or missing a permission for one of the synced endpoints. Check the key's permissions under Profile → API keys in ElevenLabs, then reconnect.

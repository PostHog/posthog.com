You can sync data from Google Ads reports by configuring it as a source in PostHog. The supported reports that can be synced include Ad, AdStats, AdGroup, AdGroupStats, Campaign, CampaignStats, Keyword, KeywordStats, Video, and VideoStats, as they are described [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transformation). Additional reports will be added based on user feedback we receive via our [in-app support form](https://us.posthog.com/#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Adata_warehouse%3Alow%3Atrue).

## Requirements
- The [Google Ads customer ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344) of the account you are trying to sync to PostHog.
- Administrator access to the Google Ads account you want to sync. If you use manager accounts then this is often enough to connect. An manager account is an Ads account type that enables you to manage several Ads accounts under a single login â€“ [see here for more on Google Ads manager accounts](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6139186).

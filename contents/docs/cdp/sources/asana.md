This source is currently in **alpha**. The interface and available tables may change.

The Asana connector pulls your Asana data — workspaces, users, projects, tasks, and more — into the PostHog data warehouse.

## Adding a data source

1. Go to the [sources tab](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/sources) of the data pipeline section in PostHog.
2. Click **+ New source** and then click **Link** next to Asana.
3. You need a personal access token from Asana. Create one from the [Asana developer console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps). Grant these read scopes so every table can sync: `workspaces:read`, `users:read`, `projects:read`, `tasks:read`, `tags:read`, `teams:read`, and `custom_fields:read`. Copy the token value.
4. Back in PostHog, paste the token in the `Personal access token` field and click **Next**.
5. Select the tables you want to sync, set the sync method and frequency, then click **Import**.

Once the syncs are complete, you can start using Asana data in PostHog.

## Available tables

| Table | Description | Sync method |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `workspaces` | Workspaces your token can access | Full refresh |
| `users` | Users across your visible workspaces | Full refresh |
| `projects` | Projects in each workspace | Full refresh |
| `tasks` | Tasks across all projects | Full refresh |
| `tags` | Tags in each workspace | Full refresh |
| `sections` | Sections within each project | Full refresh |
| `teams` | Teams in each organization workspace | Full refresh |
| `custom_fields` | Custom field definitions per workspace | Full refresh |

**Incremental** tables sync only new or updated records on each run. **Full refresh** tables reload all data on each sync.

## Sync limitations

All Asana tables are full refresh only. Asana's list endpoints do not expose a usable server-side timestamp filter, so each sync reloads the full collection.

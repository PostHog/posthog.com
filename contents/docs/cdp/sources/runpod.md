<AlphaRelease />

The RunPod connector syncs your GPU cloud infrastructure – Pods, Serverless endpoints, templates, and network volumes – plus daily billing history into PostHog, so you can analyze compute spend alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a RunPod account and an API key. A key with read permission is sufficient.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking RunPod, you'll need:

- **API key** – create one under **Settings → API Keys** in the [RunPod console](https://console.runpod.io/user/settings). The key grants read access to your Pods, endpoints, templates, network volumes, and billing history.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

The billing tables support incremental syncs: each run picks up new day buckets from where the last one stopped and re-reads a trailing window so recently restated charges stay accurate. The infrastructure tables (Pods, endpoints, templates, and network volumes) are snapshots and sync with full refresh.

<AlphaRelease />

The Campayn connector syncs your email marketing data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your campaigns and contacts alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Campayn account with access to your account settings, where you can find and regenerate your API key.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Campayn, you'll need:

- **Subdomain** – the first part of your account host. For `acme.campayn.com`, enter `acme`.
- **API key** – find and regenerate it in your Campayn account settings.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

This source is full-refresh only. Campayn's API exposes no pagination, cursors, or timestamp filters, so every table is fully re-synced on each run.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API key is invalid or has been regenerated. Create a new key in your Campayn account settings, then reconnect.
- If you see a permissions error, the key is not authorized for this data. Check the key's permissions, then reconnect.

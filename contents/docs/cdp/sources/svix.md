This source is currently in **alpha**. It has been tested against Svix's API documentation but not yet battle-tested with live production workloads. If you run into issues, please let us know.

The Svix connector syncs your webhook infrastructure data — applications and event types — into PostHog.

## Adding a data source

1. Go to the [sources tab](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/sources) of the data pipeline section in PostHog.
2. Click **+ New source** and then click **Link** next to Svix.
3. You need an API key from Svix. In your [Svix dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com), go to **Settings** > **API Access** and create or copy an API key (starts with `sk_...`).
4. Back in PostHog, enter your API key and click **Next**.
5. Select the tables you want to sync, set the sync frequency, then click **Import**.

Once the syncs are complete, you can start using Svix data in PostHog.

The Productboard connector syncs your Productboard data – features, notes, objectives, releases, and more – into the PostHog data warehouse.

## Adding a data source

1. Go to the [sources tab](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/sources) of the data pipeline section in PostHog.
2. Click **+ New source** and then click **Link** next to Productboard.
3. Next, you need a public API access token from Productboard. In your Productboard [workspace settings](https://app.productboard.com/), go to **Integrations → Public API** and create an access token. A Pro plan or higher is required. Grant read access for the resources you want to sync — for example `entities:read`, `notes:read`, `members:read`, and `teams:read`.
4. Back in PostHog, enter the token in the `Access token` field and click **Next**.
5. Select the tables you want to sync, set the sync method and frequency, then click **Import**.

Once the syncs are complete, you can start using Productboard data in PostHog.

<AlphaRelease />

The Qualaroo connector syncs your survey (nudge) data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze survey responses alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Qualaroo account with API access so you can create API credentials.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Qualaroo, you'll need:

- **API key** – found under [Settings → API](https://app.qualaroo.com/) in your Qualaroo account.
- **API secret** – found alongside the API key under Settings → API. These credentials authenticate the REST Reporting API with read access to your nudges.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Qualaroo tables are full refresh only, since the API does not expose a reliable incremental sync filter.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error (401), your Qualaroo API key or secret is invalid or has been revoked. Generate a new pair under Settings → API in your Qualaroo account, then reconnect.
- If you get a permission error (403), your Qualaroo credentials do not have access to this data. Check the key's permissions in your account settings, then reconnect.

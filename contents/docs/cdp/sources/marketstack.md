<AlphaRelease />

The Marketstack connector syncs eod, intraday, splits, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Marketstack access key to pull end-of-day, intraday, splits, and dividends data plus market reference tables (tickers, exchanges, currencies, timezones).

You can find your access key in your [Marketstack dashboard](https://marketstack.com/dashboard).

Add one or more comma-separated **symbols** (e.g. `AAPL,MSFT,TSLA`) to sync the EOD, intraday, splits, and dividends tables - those endpoints require at least one symbol. The reference tables don't need symbols.

Note: Marketstack pricing is a monthly request quota tied to your plan. Some tables (e.g. intraday) require a paid plan.

You'll be asked for:

- **Access key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Marketstack tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the access key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

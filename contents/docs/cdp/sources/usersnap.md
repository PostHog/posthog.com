<AlphaRelease />

The Usersnap connector syncs projects, feedbacks, project assignees, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Usersnap REST API credentials to pull your Usersnap projects and feedback items.

The Usersnap REST API is a gated feature: it must be enabled on your plan by Usersnap (contact their customer success team). Once enabled, generate a JWT secret under **Settings → REST API** in Usersnap and copy both the secret and its JWT ID here - PostHog signs the short-lived bearer tokens for you.

You'll be asked for:

- **JWT secret**
- **JWT ID**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Usersnap tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the JWT secret is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

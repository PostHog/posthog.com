<AlphaRelease />

The Dodo Payments connector syncs payments, subscriptions, customers, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync payments, subscriptions, customers, refunds, disputes, payouts and your product catalog from Dodo Payments. Create an API key in your Dodo Payments dashboard under [Developer > API keys](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/api-keys). Read access is enough.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: create a key under [Developer > API keys](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/api-keys). A read-only key is enough to sync.
- **Mode**: dodo Payments keeps test and live data on separate hosts with separate keys. Pick the mode your key was issued for.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Dodo Payments tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Twelve Labs connector syncs indexes, tasks, videos, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Twelve Labs API key to sync your video understanding library.

You can create an API key in your [Twelve Labs dashboard](https://playground.twelvelabs.io/dashboard/api-key).

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `tlk_...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Twelve Labs tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

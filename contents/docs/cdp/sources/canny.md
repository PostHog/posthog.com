<AlphaRelease />

The Canny connector syncs your Canny feedback, posts, and roadmap data into PostHog, so you can analyze customer feedback alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Canny account with access to its secret API key.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Canny, you'll need:

- **API key** – find your secret API key under **Settings → API** in your Canny dashboard.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Canny list endpoints do not expose a server-side updated-since filter, so this source is full refresh only.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API key may be invalid or revoked. Find your secret API key under **Settings → API** in your Canny dashboard, then reconnect.

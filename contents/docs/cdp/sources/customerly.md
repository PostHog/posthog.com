<AlphaRelease />

The Customerly connector syncs your customer support and marketing data – users, leads, tags, and knowledge base content – into the PostHog Data Warehouse, so you can analyze your contacts and help center alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Customerly project with access to the public API so you can copy its access token.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Customerly, you'll need:

- **Access token** – in Customerly, go to **Project Settings** → **Installation** → **Public API** and copy the access token. See the [Customerly guide](https://docs.customerly.io/en/api/how-to-obtain-your-api-access-token-in-customerly) for details.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Customerly tables are full refresh only, since the API exposes no incremental sync filter.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error, your Customerly access token is invalid or expired. Generate a new token under **Project Settings** → **Installation** → **Public API**, then reconnect.

<AlphaRelease />

The Rocketlane connector pulls your customer onboarding and professional services data — projects, tasks, time entries, users, and custom fields — into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze it alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Rocketlane account with access to generate an API key.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Rocketlane, you'll need:

- **API key** – generate an API key under **Settings → API** in the [Rocketlane app](https://app.rocketlane.com/). This single key grants read access to your projects, tasks, time entries, users, and fields.

## Sync modes

All Rocketlane tables use full refresh sync. Rocketlane's list endpoints do not expose a server-side timestamp filter, so each sync reloads the full dataset.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error (401), your Rocketlane API key may be invalid or revoked. Generate a new key under **Settings → API** in the Rocketlane app, then reconnect.
- If you see a permission error (403), your API key does not have access to the requested data. Check the key's permissions, then reconnect.

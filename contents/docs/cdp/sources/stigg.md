<AlphaRelease />

The Stigg connector syncs your pricing, packaging, and monetization data – customers, subscriptions, products, plans, addons, features, and coupons – into PostHog, so you can analyze your billing and entitlement data alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Stigg account with access to a server API key for the environment you want to sync. Server API keys have read access to every resource the connector syncs.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Stigg, you'll need:

- **Server API key** – find it under **Settings → Integrations → API keys** in [Stigg](https://app.stigg.io). Make sure to use a server API key, not a client API key. Each key is scoped to a single Stigg environment, so pick the key for the environment you want to sync.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Stigg tables sync as full refresh. Stigg's API doesn't expose an updated-since filter, so incremental sync would miss updates to existing records like subscription status changes.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

The subscriptions table doesn't include subscription entitlements – Stigg's API omits them from the subscription list for performance. Plan and addon entitlements are included in the `entitlements` column of the plans and addons tables.

## Troubleshooting

If your source fails to connect with an "Invalid Stigg API key" error, double check that you're using a **server** API key (client API keys can't read the API) and that the key belongs to the environment you want to sync.

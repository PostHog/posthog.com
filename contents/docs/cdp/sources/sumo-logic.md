<AlphaRelease />

The Sumo Logic connector syncs logs, users, roles, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Connect your Sumo Logic account to sync log search results, collectors, monitors, dashboards, users, and more.

Create an access ID and access key in your [Sumo Logic preferences](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys/) (or use a service account's access key). Pick the deployment region your account lives on - it's the subdomain of your Sumo Logic URL (e.g. `service.eu.sumologic.com` is the EU deployment).

The `logs` table runs your log search query through the Search Job API over rolling time windows. Leave the query as `*` to sync everything, or narrow it (e.g. `_sourceCategory=prod/api`) to control volume.

You'll be asked for:

- **Deployment region**: choose between US1 (api.sumologic.com), US2 (api.us2.sumologic.com), AU (api.au.sumologic.com), CA (api.ca.sumologic.com), DE (api.de.sumologic.com), EU (api.eu.sumologic.com), FED (api.fed.sumologic.com), IN (api.in.sumologic.com), JP (api.jp.sumologic.com) and KR (api.kr.sumologic.com).
- **Access ID**: for example `su...`.
- **Access key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Sumo Logic tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the access key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

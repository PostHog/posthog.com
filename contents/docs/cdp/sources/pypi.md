<AlphaRelease />

The PyPI connector syncs Python package metadata from the [PyPI JSON API](https://docs.pypi.org/api/json/) into the PostHog Data warehouse: project details, release files, and known vulnerabilities for the packages you track.

## Prerequisites

None. PyPI's read APIs are public, so no account or credentials are required. You only need the names of the packages you want to track.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

PyPI has no list endpoint, so enter the package names you want to track — one per line or comma-separated:

```
requests
django
posthog
```

Names are normalized per [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/#normalized-names), so `Requests` and `requests` resolve to the same project. You can track up to 500 packages per source.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All PyPI tables are full refresh only, since the API exposes no incremental sync filter.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If a package fails to sync, check that the name matches the project on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org). Packages that return a 404 are skipped rather than failing the whole sync.
- If you see a "too many packages" error, reduce your list to 500 or fewer packages.

<AlphaRelease />

The Demodesk connector syncs demos, demo templates, users, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Demodesk API key. Admins can generate one in Demodesk under integration settings, in the Demodesk API section. Use a company admin's key to sync team-wide meetings and recordings. A regular user's key only syncs what that user can see.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Demodesk tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

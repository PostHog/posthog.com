<AlphaRelease />

The Zapier (Storage by Zapier) connector syncs records and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Storage by Zapier store secret to pull your key/value store.

The secret is the per-store UUID you use with the [Storage by Zapier](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496293271053) app (the `secret` value passed to `StoreClient`, or the `X-Secret` you send to `store.zapier.com`). It both identifies and authorizes the store, so treat it like a password.

Only full-refresh syncing is supported: the store has no timestamps, so every sync pulls the whole store.

You'll be asked for:

- **Store secret**: for example `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Zapier (Storage by Zapier) tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the store secret is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

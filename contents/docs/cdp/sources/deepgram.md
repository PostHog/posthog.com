<AlphaRelease />

The Deepgram connector syncs projects, members, keys, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Deepgram API key to sync your Deepgram Management API data.

You can create an API key in your [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/) under **Settings → API Keys**. A key with a read-capable scope (e.g. `member`) is sufficient - the source only reads projects, members, keys, balances, invites, and the request log.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Some Deepgram tables sync incrementally, so later runs only fetch new or updated rows. The rest are full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

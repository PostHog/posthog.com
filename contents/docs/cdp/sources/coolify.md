<AlphaRelease />

The Coolify connector syncs applications, databases, deployments, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Coolify instance URL and an API token to pull your servers, projects, applications, databases, services, deployments, and teams.

Create a token under **Keys & Tokens > API tokens** in your Coolify dashboard. A read-only token is enough, because this source never writes or deploys.

The instance URL is where your Coolify dashboard runs, for example `https://coolify.example.com` (use `https://app.coolify.io` for Coolify Cloud).

You'll be asked for:

- **Instance URL**: for example `https://coolify.example.com`.
- **API token**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Coolify tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

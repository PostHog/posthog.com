<AlphaRelease />

The Bluesky connector syncs profile, posts, followers, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

None. The Bluesky API is public, so no account or API key is needed.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync a Bluesky account's profile, posts, followers, and follows. Uses Bluesky's public AppView API, so you only need the handle or DID you want to track, not an account password or app password.

You'll be asked for:

- **Handle or DID**: the Bluesky handle (e.g. `jay.bsky.team`) or DID of the account to sync.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Bluesky tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

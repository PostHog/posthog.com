<AlphaRelease />

The Flexmail connector syncs contacts, custom fields, interests, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Flexmail account ID and personal access token to pull your email marketing data.

You can create a personal access token under **Settings → API → Personal access tokens** in [Flexmail](https://app.flexmail.eu). The token grants read access to your contacts, interests, custom fields, preferences, segments, sources, and opt-in forms.

You'll be asked for:

- **Account ID**
- **Personal access token**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Flexmail tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the personal access token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

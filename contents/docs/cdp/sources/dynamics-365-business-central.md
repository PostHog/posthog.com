<AlphaRelease />

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central connector syncs companies, accounts, bank accounts, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync your Business Central customers, vendors, items, documents and general ledger entries.

Register an app in [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/automation-apis-using-s2s-authentication) and grant it the `API.ReadWrite.All` application permission with admin consent, then add it as a Business Central user in the environment you want to sync. Enter that app's client ID and secret below, along with your Entra tenant ID and the environment name (usually `production`).

Every table except companies is synced for all companies in the environment, with the company ID kept on each row.

You'll be asked for:

- **Microsoft Entra tenant ID**: for example `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
- **Environment name**: for example `production`.
- **Application (client) ID**: for example `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
- **Client secret**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Supported tables

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the client secret is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

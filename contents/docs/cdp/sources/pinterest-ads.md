## Requirements

- A Pinterest Ads account with permission to access data from the accounts you want to sync.

> **Tip:** If you need to find your Ad Account ID manually, go to [Pinterest Business](https://business.pinterest.com/) > Ads > select your account. The ID is in the URL or account settings.

## Configuring PostHog

Connect PostHog to your Pinterest Ads account using a Pinterest account. The Pinterest account must have permission to access the ad account data.

1. In PostHog, go to the **[Data pipelines](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/sources)** tab.
2. Open the **+ New** drop-down menu in the top-right and select **Source**.
3. Find Pinterest Ads in the sources list and click **Link**.
4. Connect your Pinterest account by selecting an existing integration or creating a new one.
5. Select the **Ad Account** you want to sync from the dropdown. Each account displays your permission level (Owner, Campaign Manager, etc.).
6. (Optional) Add a prefix for the table name.

<AlphaRelease />

The Writesonic connector syncs performance summary, performance prompts, performance answers, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Connect Writesonic to pull your GEO (generative engine optimization) data - brand visibility, rank, and mentions across AI platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity - .

You'll need:

- A Writesonic **API key** with GEO API access (revealed in your account's API dashboard; requires a plan with API access)
- The **site URL** of the tracked website, exactly as configured in Writesonic (e.g. `https://example.com`)
- Optionally, a **project ID** to disambiguate when the same site is tracked in multiple projects

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `Your Writesonic API key`.
- **Site URL**: for example `https://example.com`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Writesonic tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

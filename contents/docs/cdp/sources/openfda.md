<AlphaRelease />

The openFDA connector syncs drug events, drug labels, drug ndc, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Pull U.S. FDA drug, device, and food data - adverse event reports, recalls, drug labeling, 510(k) clearances, and the NDC directory - .

An API key is optional but recommended. Without one, openFDA limits you to 1,000 requests/day per IP; with one, 120,000 requests/day. Get a free key from the [openFDA API basics page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/authentication/).

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All openFDA tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key (optional) is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

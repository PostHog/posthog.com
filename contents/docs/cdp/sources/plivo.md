<AlphaRelease />

The Plivo connector syncs messages, calls, recordings, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Plivo Auth ID and Auth Token to sync your SMS message and voice call detail records. Both are shown on the overview page of the [Plivo console](https://console.plivo.com/dashboard/).

Plivo retains message and call records for **90 days**, so syncing them into the warehouse lets you keep history beyond that window.

You'll be asked for:

- **Auth ID**: for example `MAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
- **Auth token**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Plivo tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the auth token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

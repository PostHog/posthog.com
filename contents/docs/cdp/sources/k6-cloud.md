<AlphaRelease />

The Grafana Cloud k6 connector syncs test runs, projects, load tests, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Grafana Cloud k6 API token and stack ID to pull your load testing data.

Create a Personal API token (or use a Grafana Stack API token) and find your stack ID under **Testing & synthetics → Performance → Settings** in Grafana Cloud.

You'll be asked for:

- **API token**: for example `Personal or Stack API token`.
- **Stack ID**: for example `12345`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Grafana Cloud k6 tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Gridly connector syncs records, columns, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Gridly API key and a View ID to pull that view's records.

Create an API key in your Gridly company settings under **Settings → API keys** (Owner or Admin access is required). Use a **Full Access** or **Read-only** key.

Find the **View ID** in Gridly by opening your grid, selecting a view, and opening the **API** panel - it looks like `v1v9jwwk1lwnkz`. For the default Master branch this is the same as the Grid ID.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**
- **View ID**: for example `v1v9jwwk1lwnkz`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Gridly tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

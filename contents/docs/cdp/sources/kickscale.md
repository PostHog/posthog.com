<AlphaRelease />

The Kickscale connector syncs meetings, calls, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync analyzed meetings and calls from Kickscale. Find your API key and client ID under Settings > Integrations > API & Webhooks in Kickscale (requires a Configurator or Admin role). API keys expire after 1 year.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**
- **Client ID**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Kickscale tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

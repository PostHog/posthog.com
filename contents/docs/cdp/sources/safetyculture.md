<AlphaRelease />

The SafetyCulture connector syncs your workplace-operations data – inspections and their answers, templates, corrective actions, issues, assets, users, groups, sites, and schedules – into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze your safety and operations workflows alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a SafetyCulture account on a **Premium or Enterprise plan** with permission to create an API token. Data feed access follows the token owner's permissions, so SafetyCulture recommends granting the **Data Access** permission for warehouse integrations.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking SafetyCulture, you'll need:

- **API token** – generate one under **Account settings → Integrations → Manage API tokens** in [SafetyCulture](https://app.safetyculture.com).

API tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity, so SafetyCulture recommends a [service user](https://help.safetyculture.com/en-US/1064186-service-users) token for long-term integrations.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Inspections, inspection items, templates, and actions support incremental sync on `modified_at` via SafetyCulture's server-side `modified_after` filter. The other tables are full refresh only.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API token is invalid or has expired – tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. Generate a new token (ideally for a service user), then reconnect.
- If you see a permissions error on a specific table, the token's user is missing access to that data feed. Grant the user the **Data Access** permission in SafetyCulture, then reconnect.

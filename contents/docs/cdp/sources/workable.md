<AlphaRelease />

The Workable connector syncs your recruiting data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your jobs and candidates alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Workable account with admin access so you can create an access token.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Workable, you'll need:

- **Account subdomain** – the subdomain from `https://<subdomain>.workable.com`.
- **API access token** – create one in your Workable account under **Settings > Integrations > Access Tokens** (admins only). Grant the `r_jobs` and `r_candidates` read scopes.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error, your Workable access token is invalid or has expired. Create a new token in your Workable account settings, then reconnect.
- If you get a permission error, your access token is missing the read scopes needed to sync this data (e.g. `r_jobs`, `r_candidates`). Grant them in your Workable account settings, then reconnect.
- If your subdomain is rejected, use just the account subdomain from `https://<subdomain>.workable.com`.

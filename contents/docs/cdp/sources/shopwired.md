<AlphaRelease />

The ShopWired connector syncs your e-commerce store data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your products, customers, and orders alongside your product analytics data.

## Prerequisites

You need a ShopWired account with access to API keys. API credentials inherit full access to your store's data.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking ShopWired, you'll need:

- **API key** and **API secret** – create these under **Account > API keys** in your [ShopWired](https://www.shopwired.co.uk) account.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Orders support incremental sync using their creation date. ShopWired doesn't expose a modified-date filter, so incremental syncs only pick up newly created orders — changes to existing records are only captured by a full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API key or secret is invalid or has been revoked. Generate new credentials under **Account > API keys** in ShopWired, then reconnect.
- Syncs of very large stores can be slowed by ShopWired's API rate limit (2 requests per second sustained). The connector backs off and retries automatically, so this shows up as a longer sync, not a failure.

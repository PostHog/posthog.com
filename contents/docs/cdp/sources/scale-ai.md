<AlphaRelease />

The Scale AI connector syncs tasks, batches, projects, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Scale AI API key to sync your Scale data labeling data.

You can find your API key in the [Scale dashboard](https://dashboard.scale.com/) under **Settings → API Keys**. Use a **live-mode** key - test-mode keys have fully isolated data. Only account Managers and Admins can access API keys.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `live_...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Scale AI tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

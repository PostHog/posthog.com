<AlphaRelease />

The BigCommerce connector syncs products, categories, brands, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your BigCommerce store hash and API access token to pull your store data. Create an API account under **Settings → API → Store-level API accounts** with `read-only` scope for **Products**, **Orders** and **Customers**.

You'll be asked for:

- **Store hash**: found in your store's control panel URL: `https://store-{store_hash}.mybigcommerce.com`.
- **Access token**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All BigCommerce tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the access token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

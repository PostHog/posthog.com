<AlphaRelease />

The Northflank connector syncs your deployment infrastructure metadata into the PostHog Data warehouse. [Northflank](https://northflank.com/) is a developer platform for deploying containers, jobs, and managed databases. Once linked, you can join your Northflank projects, services, jobs, addons, and volumes against your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Northflank account with API access. You can use either a personal or team API token. Create one in your [Northflank account settings](https://app.northflank.com/) and grant it read access to the resources you want to sync.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Northflank, you'll need:

- **API token** – a personal or team API token from your [Northflank account settings](https://app.northflank.com/). Grant it read access to the projects and resources you want to sync.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Northflank tables use full refresh only, since the API doesn't support server-side timestamp filtering. This means the entire dataset is reloaded on each sync. Because these are infrastructure metadata tables, the data volume is typically small.

## Rate limits

Northflank enforces an account rate limit of 1,000 requests per hour. PostHog implements per-project page caps to stay within this limit during syncs.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an authorization error, your Northflank API token is invalid or has been revoked. Create a new token in your [Northflank account settings](https://app.northflank.com/), then reconnect.
- If you get a permission error, your Northflank API token doesn't have the required read access. Update the token's permissions, then reconnect.

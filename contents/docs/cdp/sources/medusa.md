<AlphaRelease />

The Medusa connector syncs orders, draft orders, products, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync orders, products, customers and more from your self-hosted Medusa server.

Requires Medusa v2. Create a secret API key in your Medusa Admin dashboard under **Settings > Secret API Keys**, then enter it here with your server's URL. Publishable API keys only work with the Store API and will not work here.

You'll be asked for:

- **Medusa server URL**: for example `https://store.example.com`.
- **Secret API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Medusa tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the secret API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

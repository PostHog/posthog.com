<AlphaRelease />

The OwnerRez connector syncs bookings, payments, guests, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your OwnerRez account email and personal access token to pull your bookings, guests, payments, and property data.

Create a personal access token under **Settings → Advanced Tools → Developer/API Settings** in your OwnerRez account. OwnerRez rate limits personal access tokens per IP address to two accounts every 24 hours, so this connection method suits a single OwnerRez account rather than many.

You'll be asked for:

- **Account email**: for example `you@example.com`.
- **Personal access token**: for example `pt_...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All OwnerRez tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the personal access token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

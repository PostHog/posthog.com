<AlphaRelease />

The Pluralsight Flow connector syncs users, teams, commits, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Import commits, pull requests, tickets, and coding/collaboration metrics from Pluralsight Flow (formerly GitPrime). Generate an API key in Flow under Settings > API keys. Coding metrics and Collaboration metrics need the **Metrics API** permission on that key; the other tables only need the key itself.

You'll be asked for:

- **Workspace**: the subdomain in your Flow URL, e.g. 'acme' for acme.appfireflow.com.
- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Pluralsight Flow tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

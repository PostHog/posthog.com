<AlphaRelease />

The Teamwork connector syncs your Teamwork.com projects data into PostHog, so you can analyze your projects and team workflow alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a Teamwork.com account with access to your API key. The key inherits your own permissions, so it can only sync data you can see.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking Teamwork, you'll need:

- **Site** – your Teamwork.com site, for example `yoursite.teamwork.com`.
- **API key** – find your key under **Profile → Edit my details → API & Mobile** in Teamwork.

## Configuration

## Supported tables

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an authentication error, your API key may be invalid or revoked. Generate a new key in your Teamwork profile settings, then reconnect.
- If you see a permission error, check the key's permissions, then reconnect. The key can only access data your own account can see.

<AlphaRelease />

The STRATO connector syncs servers, snapshots, images, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync your STRATO ServerCloud resources, such as servers, snapshots, images, storage, networking, and users.

This source covers the STRATO ServerCloud product only. To get an API token, open the STRATO CloudPanel, go to **Management** > **Users**, select or create a user, enable API access, and copy the API key.

You'll be asked for:

- **API token**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All STRATO tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

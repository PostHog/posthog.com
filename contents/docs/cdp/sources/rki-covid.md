<AlphaRelease />

The RKI COVID-19 connector syncs germany, germany age groups, germany history cases, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

None. The RKI COVID-19 API is public, so no account or API key is needed.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Pull German COVID-19 statistics (nationwide, per state, and per district) from the public RKI COVID-19 API at [api.corona-zahlen.org](https://api.corona-zahlen.org).

No credentials are needed. The API is a community-maintained wrapper (by Marlon Lückert) over published Robert Koch-Institut figures, not an official RKI service.

Optionally limit the history tables to the last N days; leave empty to sync the full history.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All RKI COVID-19 tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

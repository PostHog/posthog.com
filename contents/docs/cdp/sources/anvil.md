<AlphaRelease />

The Anvil connector syncs organizations, casts, welds, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Sync metadata about your Anvil documents: organizations, PDF templates (casts), workflows (welds), workflow submissions, and e-signature packets with their signer status.

Create an API key in your Anvil organization settings, under API settings. Development keys are rate limited to 4 requests per second, so large accounts sync faster with a production key.

Only metadata is synced. Filled PDFs, signed documents, and submission form data never leave Anvil.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Anvil tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Vantage connector syncs cost reports, budgets, folders, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Vantage API access token to pull your Vantage FinOps data.

Create a read-scoped access token or a service token from your [Vantage settings](https://console.vantage.sh/settings/access_tokens). Only the `read` scope is required for imports.

You'll be asked for:

- **API access token**: for example `vntg_tkn_...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Vantage tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API access token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

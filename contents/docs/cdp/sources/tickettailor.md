<AlphaRelease />

The Ticket Tailor connector syncs events, event series, orders, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Ticket Tailor API key to pull your event ticketing data.

You can create an API key under **Settings → API** in your [Ticket Tailor](https://www.tickettailor.com) box office. API keys are scoped to a single box office - connect one source per box office you want to sync.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Ticket Tailor tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

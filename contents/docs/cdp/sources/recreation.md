<AlphaRelease />

The Recreation.gov connector syncs activities, campsites, events, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Import public US federal recreation data from the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) behind Recreation.gov: recreation areas, facilities, campsites, tours, permit entrances, and more.

To get an API key, sign in at [ridb.recreation.gov](https://ridb.recreation.gov/), open your profile from the account menu, and copy the API key shown there.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**: for example `Enter your RIDB API key`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Recreation.gov tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

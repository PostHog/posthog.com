<AlphaRelease />

The CoinAPI connector syncs cryptocurrency market data – assets, exchanges, symbols, exchange rates, and OHLCV and trade history – into PostHog, so you can analyze it alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a CoinAPI account so you can create an API key. CoinAPI uses a credit/quota-based (pay-as-you-go) model with a daily credit limit, so large time-series tables can consume significant credits.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking CoinAPI, you'll need:

- **API key** – create a key in the [CoinAPI customer portal](https://customer.coinapi.io/).

The reference tables (assets, exchanges, symbols) and exchange rates sync with just an API key. The OHLCV and trades history tables are scoped to a single market, so set the Symbol ID field (and, for OHLCV, the Period ID) to enable them.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see an invalid or incorrectly formatted key error, create a new key in the CoinAPI customer portal, then reconnect.
- If access is denied, check that your CoinAPI subscription covers the data you're trying to sync, then reconnect.

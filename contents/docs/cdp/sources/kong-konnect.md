<AlphaRelease />

The Kong Inc. (Kong Konnect) connector syncs api requests and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter a Kong Konnect access token to pull your gateway's Advanced Analytics API request logs.

Create a **Personal Access Token** under **Konnect → Personal access tokens**, or a **System Account access token** for a service identity. Either is sent as a bearer token.

Pick the **region** that matches your Konnect organization's geo - the analytics API is region-specific.

How far back the initial sync can reach depends on your Konnect plan's Advanced Analytics data retention.

You'll be asked for:

- **Access token**: for example `kpat_...`.
- **Region**: choose between US (us.api.konghq.com), EU (eu.api.konghq.com), Australia (au.api.konghq.com), Middle East (me.api.konghq.com), India (in.api.konghq.com) and Singapore (sg.api.konghq.com).

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Kong Inc. (Kong Konnect) tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the access token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

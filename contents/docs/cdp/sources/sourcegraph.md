<AlphaRelease />

The Sourcegraph connector syncs repositories, users, organizations, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Sourcegraph instance URL and an access token to pull your Sourcegraph data.

You can create an access token in Sourcegraph under **Settings > Access tokens**.

The `users` and `organizations` tables require a token created by a **site admin**; `repositories` works with any user's token.

You'll be asked for:

- **Sourcegraph URL**: for example `https://sourcegraph.example.com`.
- **Access token**: for example `sgp_...`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Sourcegraph tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the access token is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

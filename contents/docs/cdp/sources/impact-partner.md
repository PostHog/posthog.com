<AlphaRelease />

The impact.com Partner connector syncs the data your partner (publisher) account sees on [impact.com](https://impact.com): the brand programs you've joined, the conversions credited to you, and the invoices for your earnings. If your account is a brand (advertiser) account, use the [impact.com source](/docs/cdp/sources/impact) instead.

## Prerequisites

You need an impact.com partner account with API access. The connector authenticates with an API access token, which any account user can create from their profile settings.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking impact.com Partner, you'll need:

- **Account SID** and **Auth token** from an impact.com API access token.

To get these:

1. Log in to [impact.com](https://app.impact.com).
2. Go to your user profile, then **Settings** → **Technical** → **API**.
3. Create an access token with read-only scopes.
4. Copy the token's Account SID and Auth Token into PostHog.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

The `Actions` table supports incremental sync on `EventDate`, and `Invoices` on `CreatedDate`. On the first sync, `Actions` backfills up to 3 years of history in 44-day chunks, which is a limit of the impact.com API.

## Configuration

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid credentials when connecting**: check that the Account SID and Auth Token belong to a partner (publisher) account. Brand and agency accounts use different APIs, so a brand token won't validate here. For brand accounts, use the [impact.com source](/docs/cdp/sources/impact).
- **Missing older actions**: the impact.com API only returns actions from the last 3 years, so the initial backfill stops there.

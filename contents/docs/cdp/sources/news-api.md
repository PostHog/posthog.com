<AlphaRelease />

The NewsAPI connector syncs everything, top headlines, sources, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your NewsAPI key to pull live and historical news articles.

Create a free API key at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/register). The search query drives the `everything` and `top_headlines` tables; the `sources` table lists available publishers.

Note: NewsAPI's free Developer plan is limited to articles from the last month and is for development/testing only - a paid plan is required for production use and older articles.

You'll be asked for:

- **API key**
- **Search query**: for example `e.g. bitcoin OR ethereum`.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

Some NewsAPI tables sync incrementally, so later runs only fetch new or updated rows. The rest are full refresh.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The Baton connector syncs activity, companies, milestones, and more into the PostHog data warehouse, so you can analyze them alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

Credentials that can read the data you want to sync. PostHog only reads data, so read access is enough.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

Enter your Baton (Hellobaton) company instance and API key to pull your onboarding and implementation data.

Your company instance is the subdomain of your Baton URL - for `yourcompany.hellobaton.com`, enter `yourcompany`.

Generate an API key in Baton under the **API** section of your account settings. The key inherits your account permissions, so it can read every record you can see.

You'll be asked for:

- **Company instance**: for example `yourcompany`.
- **API key**

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All Baton tables are full refresh. Each sync replaces the contents of the table.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails with an authorization error, the API key is wrong, expired, or has been revoked. Create a new one, then reconnect the source.
- If a table syncs no rows, the credential may not have access to that data. Check its permissions, then reconnect the source.

<AlphaRelease />

The BigMailer connector syncs your email marketing data into the PostHog Data warehouse, so you can analyze your campaigns and contacts alongside your product data.

## Prerequisites

You need a BigMailer account with API access so you can create an API key. The key has account-wide access, so no extra scopes need to be granted.

## Adding a data source

<SourceSetupIntro />

When linking BigMailer, you'll need:

- **API key** – create one in your BigMailer console under **Account Settings → API Keys**.

## Sync modes

<SyncModes />

All BigMailer tables are full refresh only, since the API exposes no incremental sync filter.

## Configuration

<SourceParameters />

## Supported tables

<SourceTables />

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails, your BigMailer API key is invalid or lacks the required permissions. Create a new key in your BigMailer console, then reconnect.

Support is enabled via the Support product settings. Once enabled, the `posthog.conversations` API becomes available (if you have `posthog-js` installed).

### How to enable

1. Go to **Support** in PostHog and click **Settings**
2. Click **Enable conversations** – this enables the conversations API
3. To show the chat widget, go to **In-app widget** section and enable it
4. Configure your greeting message, button color, and other settings
5. Save your settings

If you enabled the widget, it will appear on your site for users to start conversations.

> **Note:** You can enable just the API without the widget if you want to build a custom support UI. Simply skip step 3.

Once enabled, visit your site and look for the chat button in the bottom-right corner.

1. Click the chat button to open the widget
2. Enter your name and email (if required)
3. Send a test message
4. Check your PostHog inbox to see the ticket

The widget automatically captures:
- **Session ID** - Links to events and exceptions from the user's session
- **Session Replay ID** - Links to the user's session recording (if replay is enabled)
- **Current URL** - The page they were on
- **User identity** - If they're identified via `posthog.identify()`

</QuestLogItem>

<QuestLogItem
    title="View and respond to tickets"
    subtitle="Required"
    icon="IconInbox"
>

All tickets appear in the Support inbox within PostHog.

### What you'll see for each ticket

- **Chat thread** - The conversation with the customer
- **Session recording** - Watch what the user was doing (if available)
- **Recent events** - Events from around when they submitted
- **Exceptions** - Any errors from their session
- **Previous tickets** - Other conversations with this user

This context helps you understand and resolve issues faster.

Don't want to use the default widget? Use the JavaScript API to build your own support experience.

```javascript
// Check if conversations are available
if (posthog.conversations.isAvailable()) {
  // Send a message
  const response = await posthog.conversations.sendMessage(
    'Hello, I need help!',
    { name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' }
  )
  
  // Fetch messages
  const messages = await posthog.conversations.getMessages()
}
```

The API gives you full control over the UI while PostHog handles the backend.

Support is completely free while in alpha. No usage limits, no credit card required.

We'll introduce pricing once we're out of alpha – we'll give you plenty of notice before that happens.

That's it! You're ready to start helping your users.

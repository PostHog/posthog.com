Support is enabled in your PostHog project settings. Once enabled, the widget and JavaScript API become available.

### How to enable

1. Go to **Settings > Conversations** in PostHog
2. Toggle **Enable conversations** on
3. Toggle **Enable widget** on to show the chat widget

The widget will automatically load on your site when you have `posthog-js` installed. You can also explicitly control this in your init config:

```javascript
posthog.init('YOUR_API_KEY', {
  disable_conversations: false // default - set to true to disable
})
```

</QuestLogItem>

    subtitle="Recommended"
    icon="IconColor"
>

Make the widget match your brand and set up a greeting for your users.

In **Settings > Conversations**, configure:

- **Button color** - Match your brand (hex value)
- **Greeting message** - The welcome text users see when they open the widget
- **Allowed domains** - Restrict which domains can show the widget (optional)

You can also collect user information before they start chatting by enabling the identification form.

    subtitle="Required"
    icon="IconFlask"

Visit your site and look for the chat button in the bottom-right corner. Click it to open the widget and send a test message.

### What to check

1. The widget appears on your site
2. You can open and close the chat panel
3. You can send a message
4. The greeting text shows correctly

If you don't see the widget, check that:
- Support is enabled in project settings
- The widget is enabled
- Your domain is in the allowed list (if you've set domain restrictions)
- `posthog-js` version is >= v1.230.0

After sending a test message, go to **Support** in PostHog to see your new ticket.

The inbox shows all tickets with:

- **Status** - New, open, pending, on hold, or resolved
- **Last message** - Preview of the most recent message
- **Unread count** - Messages you haven't seen yet

Click a ticket to view the full conversation and respond. Your response will appear in the user's widget.

Support is completely free while in alpha. No usage limits, no credit card required.

We'll introduce pricing once we're out of alpha – we'll give you plenty of notice before that happens.

The Support widget is a chat interface that appears on your website, allowing users to start conversations with your team. It loads automatically when enabled and captures session context for each ticket.

## Enabling the widget

1. Go to **Support** in PostHog and click **Settings**
2. Click **Enable conversations** (if not already enabled)
3. Go to the **In-app widget** section and enable it
4. Configure your settings (see below)
5. Save

The widget appears as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site.

## Widget configuration

These settings are configured in the **In-app widget** section of Support settings.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable widget** | Show the chat widget on your site | `false` |
| **Button color** | Primary color for the widget (hex) | `#5375ff` |
| **Greeting message** | Welcome text shown when widget opens | `"Hi! How can we help?"` |
| **Allowed domains** | Restrict which domains can show the widget | `[]` (all domains) |

## Domain restrictions

You can restrict which domains the widget appears on for security:

```javascript
// Configured in PostHog settings
domains: [
  "example.com",              // Exact match
  "*.example.com",            // Wildcard: matches sub.example.com
  "https://app.example.com"   // With protocol (protocol is stripped)
]
```

If `domains` is empty or not set, the widget shows on all domains.

## Controlling widget visibility

Use the JavaScript API to programmatically show or hide the widget:

```javascript
// Show the widget (renders it if not already rendered)
posthog.conversations.show()

// Hide and remove the widget from DOM
posthog.conversations.hide()

// Check if widget is currently visible
const isVisible = posthog.conversations.isVisible()
```

This is useful for:
- Showing the widget only on certain pages
- Triggering the widget from a custom button
- Hiding the widget during specific user flows

## Disabling the widget via config

You can disable conversations entirely via the PostHog init config:

```javascript
posthog.init('YOUR_API_KEY', {
  disable_conversations: true  // Prevents loading the conversations module
})
```

This is different from hiding the widget – it completely disables the feature.

## Email notifications

Configure your team to receive email alerts when new tickets arrive.

### Setting up notifications

1. Go to **Settings > Support** in PostHog
2. Find the **Email notifications** section
3. Select team members who should receive alerts

### What emails include

- Team name
- Ticket number
- First message preview
- Direct link to the ticket

Recipients must have access to the team to receive notifications.

## Public token

The widget uses a public token for authentication. This token is automatically generated and shown in your Support settings. It's safe to expose in client-side code.

If you need to reset the token:

1. Go to **Support > Settings**
2. Click **Regenerate token**

> **Warning:** Resetting the token will stop current chats. Users will need to refresh the page to reconnect with the new token.

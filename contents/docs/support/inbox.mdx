The Support inbox is where your team manages all customer conversations. Access it by clicking **Support** in the PostHog navigation.

## Ticket list

The inbox shows all tickets with key information at a glance:

- **Ticket number** - Unique identifier (e.g., #1, #2, #3)
- **Customer** - Name and email if provided
- **Status** - Current ticket status
- **Last message** - Preview of the most recent message
- **Unread count** - Messages you haven't seen yet

## Ticket properties

Each ticket has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ticket number** | Auto-incremented unique number per team |
| **Status** | `new`, `open`, `pending`, `on_hold`, `resolved` |
| **Priority** | `low`, `medium`, `high` (optional) |
| **Assignee** | User or role responsible for the ticket |
| **Session ID** | The PostHog session associated with this ticket |
| **Distinct ID** | PostHog distinct_id for person linking |
| **Customer traits** | Name, email, and other info captured from the widget |

## Status workflow

Use statuses to track where each ticket is in your support process:

| Status | Meaning | When to use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `new` | Just created, not yet viewed | Automatically set when ticket is created |
| `open` | Being actively worked on | When you start working on a ticket |
| `pending` | Waiting for customer response | After you've replied and need more info |
| `on_hold` | Paused for external reason | When blocked by something outside your control |
| `resolved` | Issue resolved, conversation closed | When the issue is fully addressed |

To change a ticket's status, open the ticket and use the status dropdown in the sidebar.

## Filtering and search

Find tickets quickly using the filter and search options:

**Filter by:**
- Status (new, open, pending, on hold, resolved)
- Priority (low, medium, high)
- Assignee (unassigned, specific user, specific role)
- Date range

**Search by:**
- Ticket number (e.g., "42" or "#42")
- Customer name
- Customer email

## Assignment

Assign tickets to team members or roles to distribute workload and ensure accountability.

### Who can be assigned

Tickets can be assigned to:

1. **Individual users** - A specific team member
2. **Roles** - A group of users (the role itself, not individual members)

> **Note:** Assignment is currently manual – there's no automatic routing. Only one assignment per ticket is supported.

### How to assign a ticket

1. Open a ticket
2. Click the **Assignee** dropdown in the sidebar
3. Search for and select a user or role
4. The assignment is saved automatically

### Filtering by assignee

Use the assignee filter in the ticket list:

- **Unassigned** - Show tickets with no assignment
- **User: [name]** - Show tickets assigned to a specific user
- **Role: [name]** - Show tickets assigned to a specific role

## Messages

### Message types

| Author type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Customer** | Messages sent by the end user via the widget |
| **Support** | Messages sent by your team from PostHog |
| **AI** | Messages from AI (reserved for future use) |

### Sending replies

To reply to a customer:

1. Open a ticket
2. Type your message in the input at the bottom
3. Press Enter or click Send

Your reply will appear in the customer's widget.

### Private messages

Messages can be marked as private for internal communication. Private messages:

- Are only visible to your team in PostHog
- Are hidden from customers in the widget
- Useful for internal notes, handoff context, or documenting steps taken

To send a private message, toggle the "Private" option before sending.

### Unread tracking

The system tracks unread messages separately for customers and your team:

- **For customers** - Messages from your team they haven't seen yet
- **For your team** - Messages from customers you haven't seen yet

Unread counts reset when:
- Your team views a ticket in PostHog
- The customer views the widget (via the mark as read endpoint)

## Ticket detail page

When you open a ticket, you see the full conversation along with helpful context panels.

### Chat thread

The main area shows the conversation history with the customer. Messages are displayed chronologically with:
- Author name and type
- Timestamp
- Message content
- Private message indicator (if applicable)

### Context panels

The sidebar shows additional context to help you understand the customer's situation:

#### Recent events panel

Shows events from approximately ±5 minutes around when the ticket was created. This helps you see:
- What pages they visited
- What actions they took
- Any errors that occurred

#### Exceptions panel

Displays any errors or exceptions from the user's session. This is especially helpful for debugging issues the customer is reporting.

#### Previous tickets panel

Shows other tickets from the same person (matched by distinct_id). This helps you:
- See their support history
- Avoid asking for information they've already provided
- Understand recurring issues

#### Session recording

If session replay is enabled and available, you can watch the user's session recording inline. This shows exactly what the user was doing when they reached out.

> **Note:** Session recording requires [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay) to be enabled in your project.

## Best practices

### Responding quickly

- Use the unread filter to prioritize new messages
- Assign tickets to specific team members to avoid duplicate work
- Set up [email notifications](/docs/support/widget#email-notifications) so you don't miss new tickets

### Using statuses effectively

- Move tickets to `pending` after replying so you can focus on tickets that need action
- Use `on_hold` when waiting for something external (deployment, third-party, etc.)
- Mark as `resolved` when the issue is fully addressed – the customer can always reply to reopen

### Leveraging context

- Check the recent events panel before asking "what were you doing?"
- Look at exceptions first for bug reports
- Review previous tickets to understand the customer's history

The Support inbox is where your team views and responds to customer conversations. Each ticket includes rich context from PostHog to help you understand and resolve issues quickly.

## Accessing the inbox

Go to **Support** in the main PostHog navigation to access your inbox.

## Ticket properties

Each ticket has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ticket number** | Auto-incremented unique number (e.g., #1, #2, #3) |
| **Status** | `new`, `open`, `pending`, `on_hold`, `resolved` |
| **Priority** | `low`, `medium`, `high` (optional) |
| **Channel** | Where the ticket came from (currently `widget` only) |
| **Assignee** | User or role responsible for the ticket |
| **Session ID** | The PostHog session for events and exceptions |
| **Session Replay ID** | The session recording (if replay is enabled) |
| **Distinct ID** | PostHog distinct_id for person linking |

## Status workflow

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `new` | Just created, not yet viewed by team |
| `open` | Being actively worked on |
| `pending` | Waiting for customer response |
| `on_hold` | Paused for external reason |
| `resolved` | Issue resolved, conversation closed |

## Filtering and search

The ticket inbox supports filtering by:

- **Status** - Filter by ticket status
- **Priority** - Filter by priority level
{/*- **Channel source** - Filter by where the ticket came from*/}
- **Assignee** - Unassigned, specific user, or specific role
- **Date range** - Filter by creation date
- **Search** - Search by ticket number, customer name, or email

## Assignment

Tickets can be assigned to:

1. **Individual users** - A specific team member
2. **Roles** - A group of users (the role itself, not individual members)

### How to assign a support ticket

1. Open a ticket
2. Click the **Assignee** dropdown in the sidebar
3. Search for and select a user or role
4. The assignment is saved automatically

Assignment is manual with no automatic routing. Each ticket supports one assignee.

</CalloutBox>

### Filtering by assignee

In the ticket list, use the assignee filter:
- **Unassigned** - Show tickets with no assignment
- **User: [name]** - Show tickets assigned to a specific user
- **Role: [name]** - Show tickets assigned to a specific role

## Messages

### Author types

| Author type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Customer** | Messages sent by the end user via the widget |
| **Support** | Messages sent by your team from PostHog |
| **AI** | Messages from AI (reserved for future use) |

### Unread tracking

The system tracks unread messages separately for:
- **Customer** - Messages the customer hasn't seen (from your team)
- **Team** - Messages your team hasn't seen (from the customer)

Unread counts reset when:
- Team views a ticket in PostHog
- Customer calls the "mark as read" endpoint from the widget

## Ticket detail page

When you open a ticket, you'll see several panels with context:

### Chat thread

The main conversation with the customer. Send replies here – they'll appear in the customer's widget.

### Session recording panel

If the user has session replay enabled, you can watch their session directly in the ticket view. This shows what they were doing before and when they reached out.

### Recent events panel

Events from ±5 minutes around when the ticket was created. This helps you understand:
- What actions led to the support request
- What the user was trying to accomplish
- Any errors or unusual patterns

### Exceptions panel

Any errors or exceptions from the user's session. If they encountered a bug, you'll see the stack trace here.

### Previous tickets panel

Other tickets from the same person. Useful for:
- Understanding their history with support
- Identifying recurring issues
- Seeing how previous issues were resolved

## Tips for efficient support

1. **Check [session replay](/docs/session-replay)** before asking the user to describe what happened
2. **Look at exceptions** to quickly identify bugs
3. **Review previous tickets** to avoid asking repeat questions
4. **Set status to pending** after you respond to track who's waiting for a reply

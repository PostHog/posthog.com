A conversion goal is a key event or action you want users to do. It can be seen as the main focus your website is driving towards. These are known as **conversion actions** in Google Ads and **key events** in GA4. Examples include:

- Signup
- Book a demo
- Subscribe
- Download
- Form submission

In web analytics, these are higher-level goals that work well in the overview. To dive deeper, visualize multiple steps, and use breakdowns, you can use [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels). 

## How to set up a conversion goal

To set up a conversion goal, first, you need to either capture a custom event or create an action for your goal.

- For help capturing a custom event, see our guide on [capturing custom events](/docs/getting-started/send-events#2-capture-custom-events).
- For help creating an action, see our guide on [creating an action from autocapture events](/docs/getting-started/actions-and-insights).

Once created, head to the [web analytics dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/web) and click on **Add conversion goal** next to filters. Search and select your custom event or action. This adds conversion metrics to your dashboard.

> **Note:** There is also a **goals** section at the bottom of the dashboard that contains recent and popular actions that can potentially be used as conversion goals.

## Conversion goal metrics

Adding a conversion goal adds the following metrics to the [web analytics dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard):

- **Total conversions:** Total count of the conversion goal event or action.
- **Unique conversions:** Total count of unique persons who did the conversion goal.
- **Conversion rate:** The percentage of visitors who do the conversion goal.

Each of these also can be visualized on the graph below.

## How to improve your conversion

Once you set up your conversion goal, what else is there to do other than improve it? Here are some recommendations:

- Add filters to your web analytics dashboard to get conversion for sections of your site, demographics, marketing channels, and more.
- Watch [session replays](/docs/session-replay) that include your conversion goal to identify friction, confusion, and other issues.
- Set up a destination to send conversions to ad platforms like [Google Ads](/docs/cdp/destinations/google-ads) to optimize your ad spend.
- Run [A/B tests](/docs/experiments) related to the conversion goal such as changing the copy, checkout flow, or subscription form.

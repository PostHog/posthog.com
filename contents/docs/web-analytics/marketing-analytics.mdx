**Marketing analytics** enables you to track marketing campaigns, costs, and performance from multiple advertising platforms in your [marketing analytics dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/web/marketing).

## Marketing dashboard

The marketing dashboard contains multiple pre-built insights that help you understand your campaigns and costs. 

### Marketing costs over time

    alt="Marketing analytics dashboard showing marketing costs over time"
    classes="rounded"
/>

The marketing costs chart displays your total advertising spend across all configured data sources:

- **Stacked area visualization** shows the contribution of each platform to your total marketing spend
- **Time-based trends** help identify spending patterns and budget allocation over the selected date range
- **Date range filtering** allows you to analyze costs for specific periods using the date picker
- **Real-time updates** reflect new cost data as it syncs from your configured marketing sources (based on your source sync configuration)
- **Currency conversion** automatically converts all costs to your configured base currency for consistent reporting

### Campaign breakdown

    alt="Campaign costs breakdown table showing detailed performance metrics"
    classes="rounded"
/>

The campaign breakdown table provides detailed performance metrics by individual campaign:

- **Campaign**: Campaign identifier from your advertising platform (must match the `utm_campaign` value in your conversion events)
- **Source**: Ad platform name (e.g., `google`, must match the `utm_source` value in your conversion events)
- **Total cost**: Total spend for the campaign in your base currency
- **Total clicks**: Number of clicks received during the selected period
- **Total impressions**: Number of impressions served
- **Cost per click**: Average cost per click (total cost รท total clicks)
- **CTR**: Clickthrough rate percentage (total clicks รท total impressions ร 100)
- **Conversion goals**: Performance against your defined conversion goals
- **Cost per conversion**: Cost efficiency for conversions (total cost รท conversions)

## Settings and configuration

### Data source configuration

PostHog supports three types of data sources for marketing analytics. All sources are configured through a unified interface that shows the connection status, required table syncing, and column mapping for each source type.

#### Native sources

PostHog can automatically sync marketing data from supported advertising platforms. You'll need to sync the required tables for each source to enable the functionality.

**Supported native sources:**

| Platform | Setup Guide | Required Tables |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Google Ads | [Setup guide](/docs/cdp/sources/google-ads) | `campaign` and `campaign_stats` |
| LinkedIn Ads | [Setup guide](/docs/cdp/sources/linkedin-ads) | `campaigns` and `campaign_stats` |
| Meta Ads | [Setup guide](/docs/cdp/sources/meta-ads) | `campaigns` and `campaign_stats` |
| TikTok Ads | [Setup guide](/docs/cdp/sources/tiktok-ads) | `campaigns` and `campaign_report` |
| Reddit Ads | [Setup guide](/docs/cdp/sources/reddit-ads) | `campaigns` and `campaign_report` |

Each native source automatically handles data formatting and provides the required campaign and performance data. The configuration interface shows which tables are syncing and which still need to be enabled.

#### Data warehouse sources

You can _optionally_ connect external data warehouse sources (currently BigQuery) to display marketing analytics. You'll need to map the required columns for each table to enable the functionality.

**Required field mappings:**
- **Campaign**: Campaign identifier or name (mapped to `utm_campaign` query param)
- **Cost**: Cost amount for the period
- **Date**: Date of the data record
- **Source**: Platform name (mapped to `utm_source` query param)

**Optional field mappings:**
- **Clicks**: Number of clicks received
- **Currency**: Currency code for cost values
- **Impressions**: Number of impressions served

#### Self-managed sources

You can configure self-managed sources from S3, GCS, Cloudflare R2, and Azure. Like data warehouse sources, you'll need to map the required columns for each table to enable the functionality.

> **Note:** We strongly recommend using JSON format for better support and troubleshooting. You simply need to create a connection between PostHog and your marketing source, map the desired fields, and PostHog will use the marketing data directly from that source.

Please refer to the [data pipeline docs](/docs/cdp/sources) for more information on configuring external data sources.

### Conversion goals

    alt="Conversion goals configuration"
    classes="rounded"
/>

Define conversion goals by selecting events, actions, or data warehouse tables. These goals are used to track and analyze user conversions in your marketing analytics.

To configure conversion goals, select:

| Configuration Field | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Conversion goal name | Descriptive name (e.g., purchase, sign up, download) |
| Event, action or data warehouse table | Select what to track for conversions |
| Schema mapping | For data warehouse tables, map campaign and source attribution fields. For events, PostHog uses UTM parameters: `utm_campaign` and `utm_source` |

For data warehouse table conversion goals, you'll need to map the following required fields:

| Required Field | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| UTM Campaign Name | Maps to the `utm_campaign` parameter for attribution |
| UTM Source Name | Maps to the `utm_source` parameter for attribution |
| Timestamp Field | Date/time field for the conversion event |
| Distinct ID Field (optional) | User identifier for conversion tracking |

### Base currency

    imageDark="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/bc_dark_c6547dfdb9.png"
    alt="Base currency configuration"
    classes="rounded"
/>

PostHog converts currency values for the entire team to the base currency you set in [your project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project#base-currency) before displaying them. If we can't properly detect your currency from the source data, we'll assume it's in the base currency as well.

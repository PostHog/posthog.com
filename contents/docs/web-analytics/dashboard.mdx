The web analytics dashboard provides an overview of your website's traffic. 

For the selected time range, it starts with the number of visitors, views, sessions, along with trends for each, as well as average session duration and bounce rate. Each of these is compared with the previous time range, showing how much they increased or decreased.

## Bounce rate

A bounce is a session where the user only had one pageview, no autocaptures, and spent less than 30 seconds on the page. Your bounce rate is the percentage of sessions that resulted in a bounce.

PostHog uses autocaptured events to calculate this. To make sure this value is accurate, make sure you enable [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) and are capturing both `$pageleave` and `$autocapture` events.

## Paths

Top paths and top entry paths drill down into specific pages on your site to show their views, visitors, bounce rate, and scroll depth. You can click on any of the paths to filter the dashboard for that path.

### Scroll depth

Both average scroll and deep scroll rate are calculated using how far a user has scrolled down the page and how much content has scrolled into view.

- **Average scroll depth** is the average scroll percentage across pageviews.
- **Deep scroll rate** is the percentage of users who scroll far enough down a page to view 80% of the content.

## Referrers, channels, UTMs

To get an idea of where users are visiting your site from, you can see top referrers, channels, and UTM values.

### Channel types

Based on UTMs, referring domains, and more, PostHog automatically classifies traffic into specific channel types such as:

- Direct
- Email
- Referral
- Organic Search
- Paid Search
- Organic Social
- Paid Social
- Organic Video
- Paid Video
- Organic Shopping
- Paid Shopping
- Other
- Paid Other

  alt="Web analytics channel types"

/>

We base these [definitions on GA4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en) and add logic to handle edge cases they don't.

You can find a full list of what mediums and sources relate to which channel type in the [PostHog repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/models/channel_type/channel_definitions.json).

### UTMs

UTMs include source, medium, campaign, content, and term. Each are set as URL parameters and autocaptured by PostHog. For example, the following URL has the source of `twitter`, medium of `social`, and `campaign` of `twitter-campaign`:

`https://posthog.com/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=twitter-campaign`

Setting UTMs correctly is crucial for accurately classifying your traffic, not only for UTMs, but for channel types as well.

## World map

The world map shows where your users are located, but you can also select it to show top countries, regions (like California, England, or Ontario), or cities.

## Retention

Retention creates a cohort of unique users who performed any event for the first time in the last week. It then tracks the percentage of users who return to perform any event in the following weeks.

## Filtering your dashboard

Like other dashboards in PostHog, the web analytics dashboard is filterable. This means you can filter for data with certain event or person property values. Options include browser, path name, device type, country, and UTMs. Just click the "Add filter" button next to the date range at the top of the dashboard.

This enables you to dive into specific stats for regions, parts of the site, and specific marketing campaigns. 

For more complex queries, you can still use the product analytics tab as usual.

> Web analytics is currently an [opt-in public beta](/docs/getting-started/enable-betas). This means it's not yet a perfect experience, but we'd love to know your thoughts. Please [share your feedback](http://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal) and [follow our roadmap](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/18547).

Web analytics enables you to easily track and monitor many of the most important metrics for your website. 

Unlike product analytics, web analytics offers a more streamlined and focused experience. This is especially useful for marketers, content creators, or anyone used to tools like Google Analytics. It includes a dashboard that offers essential metrics, such as visitors, views, sessions, session duration, bounce rate, paths, referrers, and more.

## Get started with web analytics

Getting started is a simple three-step process.

### 1. Install PostHog on your website

Follow the [installation instructions](/docs/product-analytics/installation) to setup either the JavaScript snippet or the JavaScript Web SDK for the website you want to track.

Web analytics works without capturing [person profiles](/docs/data/persons). This means if you are primarily using PostHog for web analytics, it can be significantly cheaper for you. To do this, set your [JavaScript Web](/docs/libraries/js) `process_person` config option to `identified_only` or `never` like this:

```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        process_person: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```

> [Single page apps](/tutorials/single-page-app-pageviews) might require you to manually implement `$pageview` and `$pageleave` event capture for every navigation change. See our tutorials on how to do this in [React](/tutorials/single-page-app-pageviews), [Next.js](/docs/libraries/next-js#client-side-setup), [Vue](/docs/libraries/vue-js#capturing-page-views), and [Svelte](/tutorials/svelte-analytics#capturing-pageviews-and-pageleaves).

### 2. Enable the web analytics beta

In PostHog, click your profile icon in the top right and then click "Feature preview." In the [feature preview modal](https://app.posthog.com/home#panel=feature-previews), enable "Web Analytics Dashboard"

<ProductVideo
    videoLight = {webAnalyticsVideoLight}
    videoDark = {webAnalyticsVideoDark}
    alt = "Enable web Analytics video"
    classes = "rounded"
/>

### 3. Go to the web analytics dashboard

Now, you can click the newly added [web analytics tab](https://app.posthog.com/web) to go to the [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard).

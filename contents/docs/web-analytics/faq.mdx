## What is the difference between web analytics and product analytics?

Web analytics is a streamlined experience for tracking and monitoring your most important website metrics. Product analytics is a more powerful and flexible experience for tracking your product.

<ComparisonTable column1="Web analytics" column2="Product analytics">
  <ComparisonRow column1={"One, pre-built"} column2={"Unlimited, customizable"} feature="Dashboards" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Custom insights" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Pageview, pageleave"} column2={"Any, custom"} feature="Events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Limited, pre-defined"} column2={"Any, custom"} feature="Properties" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Small teams, marketers"} column2={"Engineering, product, data teams"} feature="Built for" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"At-a-glance view of website traffic"} column2={"Analysis of product usage and user behavior"} feature="Use case" />
</ComparisonTable>

Web analytics relies on a subset of the events and properties used by product analytics. This means you can use both in tandem.

## How much does web analytics cost?

Web analytics is no additional cost on top of product analytics. Events are used between both, and follow [product analytics' pricing](/product-analytics#pricing).

## Where is my world map?

All good web analytics dashboards need to include a world map. Ours includes it too. If you can't see it, you need to enable the [GeoIP app](https://app.posthog.com/project/apps/74).

## Do stats include bots and crawlers?

No, we automatically block bots and crawlers. You can see exactly which ones [we block here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/master/src/utils/blocked-uas.ts).

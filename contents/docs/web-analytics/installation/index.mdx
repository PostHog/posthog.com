Web analytics enables you to easily track and monitor many of the most important metrics for your website.

Unlike [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics), web analytics offers a more streamlined and focused experience. This is especially useful for marketers, content creators, or anyone used to tools like [Google Analytics](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog). It includes a [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard) that offers essential metrics, such as visitors, views, sessions, session duration, bounce rate, [conversions](/docs/web-analytics/conversion-goals), paths, referrers, and more.

After installing PostHog and ensuring [autocapture](/docs/data/autocapture) is enabled, head to your [web analytics dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard) to see your data. And then check out our [getting started](/docs/web-analytics/getting-started) guide.

> **PostHog tip:** Web analytics works with [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events). This means if you are primarily using PostHog for web analytics, it can be significantly cheaper for you.

After installing PostHog and ensuring [autocapture](/docs/data/autocapture) is enabled, head to your [web analytics dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard) to see your data. And then check out our [getting started](/docs/web-analytics/getting-started) guide.

> **PostHog tip:** Web analytics works with [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events). This means if you are primarily using PostHog for web analytics, it can be significantly cheaper for you.

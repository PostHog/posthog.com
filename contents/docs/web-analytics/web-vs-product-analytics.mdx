[Web analytics](/web-analtyics) is a streamlined experience for tracking and monitoring your most important website metrics. [Product analytics](/product-analytics) is a more powerful and flexible experience for tracking your product.

When people talk about web analytics, they're referring to tracking visitors on your marketing website. They care about things like page views, bounce rate, and top sources of traffic. And product analytics is the place to find insights about your product or application.

## When should you use web analytics?

Web analytics gives you a single, pre-built [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard) for a high-level overview of your site. It's about collecting data in the aggregate, as opposed to tracking specific interactions from specific users.

## When should you use product analytics?

When you want to dive deeper into the usage of your product, you should use product analytics.

![Product analytics examples](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/f_webp,h_1080,w_1920,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1/posthog.com/contents/templates/thumbnails/featured/prodcut-analytics?_a=AXAH4nI0)

Product analytics is all about _how_ people are interacting with your product, as well as _who_ is using it. It gives you insights into metrics such as feature adoption rate, user retention, and churn.

You can use product analytics to:

- Build custom dashboards <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>
- Analyze specific users or groups of users <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>
- Visualize user cohorts <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>
- Examine retention metrics <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>

Using product analytics helps you understand the usage of specific products, the behavior of specific users, etcâ€¦

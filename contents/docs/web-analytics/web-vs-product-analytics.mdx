import { ComparisonRow } from 'components/ComparisonTable/row'

In a nutshell:

- [Web analytics](/web-analytics) is good for tracking and monitoring high-level website metrics like page views, bounce rate, and the top sources of traffic. It's a pre-defined dashboard, so it's easy to quickly dip into and find what you need.

- [Product analytics](/product-analytics) is good for diving deep into how specific users, or groups of users, behave. There are [dashboard templates](/templates) to help you get started, but you can build custom insights and dashboards to your precise needs, and use [notebooks](/docs/notebooks) for adhoc analysis.

Here's a quick comparison:

<ComparisonTable column1="Web analytics" column2="Product analytics">
  <ComparisonRow column1={"One, pre-built"} column2={"Unlimited, customizable"} feature="Dashboards" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Custom insights" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Pageview, pageleave, conversions"} column2={"Any, custom"} feature="Events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Limited, pre-defined"} column2={"Any, custom"} feature="Properties" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Small teams, marketers"} column2={"Engineering, product, data teams"} feature="Built for" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={"At-a-glance view of website traffic"} column2={"Analysis of product usage and user behavior"} feature="Use case" />
</ComparisonTable>

## When should you use web analytics?

Web analytics gives you a single, pre-built [dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/web) for a high-level overview of your site. It's about collecting data in the aggregate, as opposed to tracking specific interactions from specific users.

It can help you figure out which pages and products are most popular and resonate the most with people.

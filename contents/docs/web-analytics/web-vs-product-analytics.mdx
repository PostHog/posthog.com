[Web analytics](/web-analtyics) is a streamlined experience for tracking and monitoring your most important website metrics. [Product analytics](/product-analytics) is a more powerful and flexible experience for tracking your product.

When people talk about web analytics, they're referring to tracking visitors on your marketing website. They care about things like page views, bounce rate, and top sources of traffic. And product analytics is the place to find insights about your product or application.

## When should you use web analytics?

You should use web analytics when you want a high-level overview of your site. It gives you a tailor-made [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard).

![Web analytics dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/web_analytics_top_light_mode_2024_10_be53cf5325.png)

Web analytics is about collecting aggregate data (how many people visited in total), as opposed to specific interactions (which users clicked on a CTA).

When people talk about web analytics, they're referring to tracking visitors on your marketing website. They care about things like page views, bounce rate, and top sources of traffic.

### Dashboard

Web analytics gives you a single [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard) (as opposed to multiple customizable dashboards with product analytics).

## When should you use web analytics?

You should use web analytics when you want a high-level overview of your site.

Web analytics is about collecting aggregate data (how many people visited in total), as opposed to specific interactions (which users clicked on a CTA).

### Dashboard

Web analytics gives you a single [dashboard](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard) (as opposed to multiple customizable dashboards with product analytics).

You can use web analytics to answer questions based on your website traffic.

- **Visitors**
  - how many people are currently online right now?
  - how many people visited in the last N days?
- **Paths**
  - which pages are they visiting?
  - what's the bounce rate?
  - scroll depth?
- **Sources**
  - what are the different sources of traffic to your website?
  - PostHog automatically classifies traffic into specific acquisition [channel types](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard#channel-types).
- **Locations**
  - where are visitors located geographically?
- **Devices**
  - did they use a desktop or tablet or phone?
- **Browsers**
  - what browser were they using?
- **OS**
  - which operating systems are they using?
- **Bounce rates**
  - end path, outbound clicks
- Session durations
  - how long do sessions last?
- **Conversion goals**
 - how many people are completing important tasks AKA converting
 - how many people "showed consideration" by visiting specific pages?

Using web analytics helps you figure out what content to work on next, what products are most popular, etc.

## When should you use product analytics?

You should use product analytics when you want to dive deeper into the usage of your product.

- Analyze specific users or groups of users
- User cohorts
- retentions
- Building custom dashboards

Using product analytics helps you understand the usage of specific products, the behavior of specific users, etcâ€¦

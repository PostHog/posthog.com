[Web analytics](/web-analytics) is a streamlined experience for tracking and monitoring your most important website metrics. [Product analytics](/product-analytics) is a more powerful and flexible experience for tracking your product.

When people talk about web analytics, they're generally referring to tracking visitors on your marketing website (e.g. `posthog.com` sessions). They care about things like page views, bounce rate, and top sources of traffic.

Product analytics is the place to find insights about your application based on usage (e.g. `app.posthog.com` user behavior).

## When should you use web analytics?

Web analytics gives you a single, pre-built [dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/web) for a high-level overview of your site. It's about collecting data in the aggregate, as opposed to tracking specific interactions from specific users.

## When should you use product analytics?

When you want to dive deeper into the usage of your product, you should use product analytics.

Product analytics is all about _how_ people are interacting with your product, as well as _who_ is using it. It gives you insights into metrics such as feature adoption rate, user retention, and churn.

You can use product analytics to:

- Build custom [Dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>
- Analyze [Trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends/overview) and patterns in usage data <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>

- Follow users along their journey through your product with [User paths](/docs/product-analytics/paths) <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>
- Look for particularly engaging features with [Stickiness](/docs/product-analytics/stickiness) <details style="display:inline;"><summary style="padding:0;">ðŸ‘€</summary>Screenshot goes here...</details>

In a nutshell:

-   [Web analytics](/web-analytics) is good for tracking and monitoring high-level website metrics like page views, bounce rate, and the top sources of traffic. It's a pre-defined dashboard, so it's easy to quickly dip into and find what you need.

-   [Product analytics](/product-analytics) is good for diving deep into how specific users, or groups of users, behave. There are [dashboard templates](/templates) to help you get started, but you can build custom insights and dashboards to your precise needs, and use [notebooks](/docs/notebooks) for adhoc analysis.

Here's a quick comparison:

<ComparisonTable column1="Web analytics" column2="Product analytics">
    <ComparisonRow column1={'One, pre-built'} column2={'Unlimited, customizable'} feature="Dashboards" />
    <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Custom insights" />
    <ComparisonRow column1={'Pageview, pageleave, conversions'} column2={'Any, custom'} feature="Events" />
    <ComparisonRow column1={'Limited, pre-defined'} column2={'Any, custom'} feature="Properties" />
    <ComparisonRow
        column1={'Small teams, marketers'}
        column2={'Engineering, product, data teams'}
        feature="Built for"
    />
    <ComparisonRow
        column1={'At-a-glance view of website traffic'}
        column2={'Analysis of product usage and user behavior'}
        feature="Use case"
    />
</ComparisonTable>

## Why do the numbers differ?

You might notice that metrics like unique visitors or pageviews show different numbers in web analytics compared to a similar query in product analytics. This is expected and happens because the two tools count things differently.

### Session-based vs event-based counting

Web analytics groups data by **sessions** and counts metrics based on when the session started. Product analytics counts **events** based on when they occurred.

**Example:** A visitor starts browsing your site at 11:55 PM on December 31st and views 3 pages, with the last pageview at 12:05 AM on January 1st.

- **Web analytics** (for Jan 1-7): The session started on Dec 31st, so this visitor may not be counted in your January range
- **Product analytics** (for Jan 1-7): The pageview at 12:05 AM is counted because the event occurred on January 1st

### Date boundary handling

Web analytics attributes all metrics to the session start time, not when individual events occurred. To calculate accurate session metrics (like duration and bounce rate), it fetches session data with a 3-day buffer around your selected date range, but only counts sessions that actually started within your range.

**Example with sample data:**

Suppose you're looking at data for **February 1st, 2025** and have these pageviews:

| Session | User | Session start | Pageview time | Path |
|---------|------|---------------|---------------|------|
| A | Alice | 2025-01-31 23:50 UTC | 2025-01-31 23:50 UTC | /pricing |
| A | Alice | 2025-01-31 23:50 UTC | 2025-02-01 00:05 UTC | /docs |
| A | Alice | 2025-01-31 23:50 UTC | 2025-02-01 00:10 UTC | /signup |
| B | Alice | 2025-02-01 14:00 UTC | 2025-02-01 14:00 UTC | /dashboard |
| B | Alice | 2025-02-01 14:00 UTC | 2025-02-01 14:15 UTC | /settings |
| C | Bob | 2025-02-01 10:00 UTC | 2025-02-01 10:00 UTC | /blog |
| C | Bob | 2025-02-01 10:00 UTC | 2025-02-01 10:15 UTC | /pricing |
| C | Bob | 2025-02-01 10:00 UTC | 2025-02-01 10:30 UTC | /demo |
| D | Carol | 2025-02-01 23:55 UTC | 2025-02-01 23:55 UTC | /home |
| D | Carol | 2025-02-01 23:55 UTC | 2025-02-02 00:10 UTC | /features |

**Web analytics results** (session-based, for Feb 1):

| Metric | Count | Explanation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Unique users | 3 | Alice, Bob, Carol. Session A excluded (started Jan 31), but Alice still counted via session B. |
| Pageviews | 6 | Sessions B (2) + C (3) + D (1). Session A's Feb 1 pageviews excluded because session started Jan 31. |

**Product analytics results** (event-based, for Feb 1):

| Metric | Count | Explanation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Unique users | 3 | Alice, Bob, Carol—all had events on Feb 1. |
| Pageviews | 8 | Alice: 4 (2 from session A + 2 from B), Bob: 3, Carol: 1. Counts all Feb 1 events regardless of session start. |

The key difference: web analytics groups by session start time, while product analytics counts events by when they occurred. Alice's pageviews at 00:05 and 00:10 on Feb 1 are counted in product analytics but excluded from web analytics because her session started on Jan 31.

### Which number is "correct"?

Both are correct—they're just measuring different things:

- **Web analytics** answers: "How many sessions happened during this period?"
- **Product analytics** answers: "How many events occurred during this period?"

For most website metrics, the session-based approach in web analytics gives you a more accurate picture of user behavior. For precise event counting or custom analysis, use product analytics.

## When should you use web analytics?

Web analytics gives you a single, pre-built [dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/web) for a high-level overview of your site. It's about collecting data in the aggregate, as opposed to tracking specific interactions from specific users.

It can help you figure out which pages and products are most popular and resonate the most with people.

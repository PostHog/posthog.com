Site apps enable you easily add functionality to your site without extra code. They are injected through the `posthog-js` library or snippet and can be used to show content or banners on your site.

## Enabling apps

Head to **Data pipelines** and click the [Site apps](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/site-apps) tab. Here you can install official PostHog apps by clicking **+ New site-app**.

PostHog Cloud is our hosted and managed version of the PostHog open-source platform. It always runs on the latest release with updates and migrations managed for you.

## Getting started

With PostHog Cloud there is no deployment required. So, the steps we recommend to get started are:

1. [Sign up](https://app.posthog.com/signup?src=cloud-index) for a free PostHog Cloud account.
2. Begin [integrating PostHog](/docs/integrate) into your applications.
3. Once integrated you'll see [events](/docs/user-guides/events) coming into PostHog from your app. Also see our [complete guide to event tracking](/docs/tutorials/event-tracking-guide).
4. With events and [actions](/docs/user-guides/actions) defined you're in a great place to define your first [funnel](/docs/user-guides/funnels).

Once you've defined your first funnel, you're in a great position to start exploring the rest of PostHog.

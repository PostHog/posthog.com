PostHog Cloud is our hosted and managed version of the PostHog open-source platform. It always runs on the latest release with updates and migrations managed for you. We recommend PostHog Cloud for users where ease of use is a priority, or for non-technical users. 

## Getting started

With PostHog Cloud there is no deployment required - you simply [sign up](https://app.posthog.com/signup?src=cloud-index) for a PostHog Cloud account, with a generous free tier included.

## Next steps

-   Begin [integrating PostHog](/docs/integrate) into your applications.
-   Check out our [tutorials](/tutorials) for the most popular use cases for PostHog, and our [reference manuals](/docs/user-guides) if you want to go deeper on a particular feature.

If you want tracking data to be sent first to your domain then to PostHog to help with tracker blockers, you can set up a [reverse proxy](/docs/cloud/proxy) to PostHog Cloud.

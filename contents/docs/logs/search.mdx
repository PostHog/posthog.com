title: Search logs
---

The logs search accepts multiple tokens and quoted phrases to help you find the exact log lines you need.

- **Space-separated words** are combined with implicit AND: the log must contain all positive tokens
- **Prefix a token with `!`** to exclude logs that contain that token. You can use multiple negative tokens to exclude several different terms
- **Wrap text in double quotes** to search for an exact phrase (an exact substring match)

## How to use search

### Require multiple words

**Type:** `bug frontend`

**Result:** Shows logs that contain both the words `bug` and `frontend` anywhere in the line.

### Exclude words

**Type:** `error !timeout`

**Result:** Shows logs that contain `error` but excludes any log that also contains `timeout`.

### Combine require + exclude

**Type:** `api "server error" !403 !timeout`

**Result:** Must contain `api` and the exact phrase `server error`, and must not contain `403` or `timeout`.

### Search exact phrases

**Type:** `"failed to connect"`

**Result:** Matches logs that include the substring `failed to connect` exactly as written.

## More examples

| Query | What it finds |
|-------|---------------|
| `login timeout` | Logs that contain both `login` and `timeout` |
| `login !debug` | Logs that contain `login` and excludes logs that contain `debug` |
| `"database error"` | Logs with the exact phrase `database error` |
| `"payment failed" !trace !debug` | Logs that contain the exact phrase `payment failed` and excludes any that contain `trace` or `debug` |

## Tips

- **Special characters:** If a token contains spaces or special characters, wrap it in double quotes to treat it as a single search item
- **Standalone exclamation mark:** A standalone `!` by itself is ignored — use `!` followed by text to exclude that text
- **Multiple negative tokens:** List multiple `!tokens` (e.g., `!debug !trace`) to exclude logs that contain any of those tokens
- **Punctuation:** Quotes and escapes are handled using shell-like parsing rules, so complex tokens should be quoted if they contain spaces or special characters

PostHog logs is a powerful logging solution that works with the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). 
You don't need any vendor specific SDKs â€“ just use standard OpenTelemetry libraries.

Install and configure your logging client to send logs to PostHog:

- Use the HTTP endpoint: `https://us.i.posthog.com/logs`
- Authenticate with your project token (same token as events/exceptions)
- Include the token in the Authorization header or as a `?token=` query parameter
- Use the standard [OTLP log format](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)

Once your logs are flowing into PostHog, you can:

- **Search through logs** by level, message content, or custom attributes
- **Filter by time ranges** to find specific events
- **Correlate logs with events** from your PostHog analytics

Navigate to the Logs section in your PostHog dashboard to start exploring your log data.

Common issues you might encounter when setting up logging:

- **Authentication errors** - Make sure you're using your correct project token
- **Connection issues** - Verify the HTTP endpoint is accessible
- **Log format problems** - Ensure you're using the standard [OTLP log format](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/)

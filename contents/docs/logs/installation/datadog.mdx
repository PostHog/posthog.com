If you're already using Datadog to collect logs, you can forward them to PostHog by configuring your existing Datadog log exporters (like the Datadog Agent) to send logs to PostHog's Datadog-compatible endpoint.

<Steps>

<Step title="Get your project API key" badge="required">

You'll need your PostHog project API key to authenticate log requests. This is the same API key you use for capturing events and exceptions.

You can find your project API key in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project).

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Datadog Agent" badge="required">

Set the Datadog logs URL to point to PostHog's Datadog-compatible endpoint. The endpoint format is:

```
https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs/datadog/<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>
```

For the **Datadog Agent**, set the `DD_LOGS_CONFIG_LOGS_DD_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export DD_LOGS_CONFIG_LOGS_DD_URL="https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs/datadog/<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>"
```

Alternatively, you can set this in your `datadog.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
logs_config:
  logs_dd_url: "https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs/datadog/<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>"
```

Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>` with your actual PostHog project API key.

</Step>

<Step title="Other Datadog log exporters" badge="optional">

If you're using other Datadog log exporters or forwarders, configure them to send logs to the same endpoint:

```
https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs/datadog/<YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY>
```

The endpoint accepts logs in the standard Datadog log format, so existing integrations should work without additional changes.

</Step>

<Step title="Test your setup" badge="recommended">

Once everything is configured, test that logs are flowing into PostHog:

1. Restart the Datadog Agent (or your log forwarder) to apply the configuration
2. Generate some log entries in your application
3. Check the PostHog logs interface for your log entries
4. Verify the logs appear in your project

PostHog logs works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible client. Check the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) for your specific language or framework.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install OpenTelemetry packages" badge="required">

The key requirements are:
- Use OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) for log export over HTTP
- Send logs to your PostHog logs endpoint (see configuration step below)
- Include your project API key in the Authorization header or as a `?token=` query parameter

Find the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language in the [official registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/).

</Step>

<Step title="Get your project API key" badge="required">

You'll need your PostHog project API key to authenticate log requests. This is the same key you use for capturing events and exceptions with the PostHog SDK.

> **Important:** Use your **project API key** which starts with `phc_`. Do **not** use a personal API key (which starts with `phx_`).

You can find your project API key in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project) under "Project Variables" → "Project API key".

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the SDK" badge="required">

Configure your OpenTelemetry SDK to send logs to PostHog.

**Endpoint:**

```
<ph_client_api_host>/i/v1/logs
```

**Authentication:** Include your project API key either as an Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <ph_project_api_key>
```

Or as a query parameter on the endpoint:

```
<ph_client_api_host>/i/v1/logs?token=<ph_project_api_key>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Test your setup" badge="recommended">

Once everything is configured, test that logs are flowing into PostHog:

1. Send a test log from your application
2. Check the PostHog logs interface for your log entries
3. Verify the logs appear in your project

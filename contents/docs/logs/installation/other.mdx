PostHog logs works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible client. Check the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) for your specific language or framework.

<Steps>

<Step title="Install OpenTelemetry packages" badge="required">

The key requirements are:
- Use OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) for log export over HTTP
- Send logs to `https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs` (or your self-hosted endpoint)
- Include your project token in the Authorization header or as a `?token=` query parameter

Find the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language in the [official registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/).

</Step>

<Step title="Get your project token" badge="required">

You'll need your PostHog project token to authenticate log requests. This is the same token you use for capturing events and exceptions.

You can find your project token in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project).

</Step>

<Step title="Configure the SDK" badge="required">

Configure your OpenTelemetry SDK to send logs to PostHog:

- **Endpoint:** `https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs`
- **Authentication:** Include your project token either:
  - In the Authorization header: `Bearer {your-project-token}`
  - As a query parameter: `?token={your-project-token}`

</Step>

<Step title="Test your setup" badge="recommended">

Once everything is configured, test that logs are flowing into PostHog:

1. Send a test log from your application
2. Check the PostHog logs interface for your log entries
3. Verify the logs appear in your project

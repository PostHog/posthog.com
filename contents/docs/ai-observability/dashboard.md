It can be filtered like any dashboard in PostHog, including by event, person, and group properties. Our SDKs autocapture especially useful properties like provider, tokens, cost, model, and more.

## Customizing the dashboard

The AI Observability dashboard is fully customizable. You can add your own insights, add text cards, and more. To customize the dashboard:

Learn more about customizing dashboards in our [dashboard docs](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards).

## What can you do with the dashboard?

This dashboard is a great starting point for understanding your LLM usage and performance. You can use it to answer questions like:

- Are users using our LLM-powered features?
- What are my LLM costs by customer, model, and in total?
- Are generations erroring?
- How many of my users are interacting with my LLM features?
- Are there generation latency spikes?

To dive into specific generation events, click on the [generations](https://app.posthog.com/ai-observability/generations), [traces](https://app.posthog.com/ai-observability/traces), or [sentiment](https://app.posthog.com/ai-observability/sentiment) tabs to explore your LLM data.

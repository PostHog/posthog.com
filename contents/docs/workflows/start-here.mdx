Workflows are made up of the following building blocks:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Triggers](/docs/messaging/workflow-builder#triggers) | What starts the workflow. We let you start a workflow when an event is performed (e.g. a user signs up), or programmatically via a webhook. |
| [Dispatches](/docs/messaging/workflow-builder#dispatches) | The messages you send, mail, slack, SMS, webhook, or any PostHog real time destinations. |
| [Delays](/docs/messaging/workflow-builder#delays) | Wait steps such as "wait 2 days" or "wait until condition is true." |
| [Audience splits](/docs/messaging/workflow-builder#audience-splits) | Target and split the users you message with more specificity or try a/b testing with random branching. |
| [PostHog actions](/docs/messaging/workflow-builder#posthog-actions) | Change a person's properties, or trigger other events, once a person reaches a specific point in your workflow. |

Familiarize yourself with these components to explore the full power of the workflow builder.

Workflows is PostHog's no-code drag-and-drop tool for automating a process or delivering messages to your users.
If you want to send your users a message you will need to use a preconfigured destination or configure a messaging channel yourself. This guide shows you how.

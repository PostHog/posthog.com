<Step title="Create a new workflows channel" badge="required">

Before you can design a workflow, you need to configure a workflows channel. Channels let you dispatch actions or messages to your users.

To create a new channel, go to workflows > [**Channels** tab](https://app.posthog.com/workflows/channels) > click **+ New channel**, and select the channel you want to configure:

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="CDP channels" type="fyi">

Other than the channels shown below, you can also dispatch to any [realtime destination](/docs/cdp/destinations) in CDP. If you plan to use a CDP destination, you can configure them directly when you [design a workflow](/docs/workflows/workflow-builder).
</CalloutBox>

Email is the default workflows channel in PostHog.  

You can use it to send **[drip campaigns](/docs/workflows/email-drip-campaign), transactional messages, or announcements** directly from the [workflow builder](/docs/workflows/workflow-builder).

To configure the channel, you need to provide the following details:

- Enter your **from name** (e.g. `PostHog Team`).
- Enter your **from email** (e.g. `team@yourdomain.com`).

This is the address that recipients will see in their inbox.

To maximize deliverability and avoid spam folders, you must verify your domain.

1. After adding your email address, PostHog shows DNS records for **SPF** and **DKIM**.
2. Copy these into your domain host (e.g. Cloudflare, GoDaddy).
3. Verification may take a few minutes to propagate.

Once verified, you'll see a green check mark in your settings.

A Slack connection enables you to deliver messages to a Slack channel.

Twilio enables you to send SMS messages to your users. To configure the channel, you need to provide the following details:

| Field             | Example                                           | More info                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Account SID**   | `AC5e66a2da9f32addea17ffe6d58891bf`               | [Twilio docs](https://help.twilio.com/articles/14726256820123-What-is-a-Twilio-Account-SID-and-where-can-I-find-it-) |
| **Auth Token**    | `4C2d86b28811*****111111111111111`                | [Twilio docs](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223136027-Auth-Tokens-and-How-to-Change-Them) |

Once configured, you'll be able to use the channel in a workflow to send SMS messages to your users.

<Step title="Create a template" badge="recommended">

If you plan to send email messages, you can create a template to reuse across your workflows. If you only plan to send Slack and SMS messages, you do not need to create a template.

Navigate to **Workflows** > **Library** tab > click **New template**.

- Give your template a name.
- Write your subject line and body content (HTML and text versions are supported).
- Use variables like `{{ person.name }}` to personalize your message. See the [template builder](/docs/workflows/template-builder) documentation for more information on available variables.

Save your template â€” you'll be able to select it later when you design a workflow.

You'll still be able to edit the message directly in the workflow builder.

</Step>

<Step title="Use in a workflow" badge="required">

Once your channel is created, you can use it in a workflow to deliver messages to your users.

<Step checkpoint title="Troubleshooting" subtitle="Common issues you may encounter">

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Emails not sending? | Check that your domain is verified and you've added the DNS records correctly. |
| Spam folder issues? | Ensure SPF/DKIM are valid, and consider setting up DMARC. |
| Variables not populating? | Confirm the property exists on the person profile (e.g. `person.name`). |

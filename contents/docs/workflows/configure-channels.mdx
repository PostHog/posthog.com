<Step title="Create a new messaging channel" badge="required">

Before you can design a workflow, you need to configure a messaging channel. Workflows that send messages use messaging channels to deliver messages to your users.

To create a new channel, go to workflows > [**Channels** tab](https://app.posthog.com/workflows/channels) > click **+ New channel**, and select the channel you want to configure:

<Tab.Group tabs={[
'Email', 
'Slack', 
'Twilio']}>
<Tab.List>
<Tab>Email</Tab>
<Tab>Slack</Tab>
<Tab>Twilio</Tab>
</Tab.List>
<Tab.Panels>
<Tab.Panel>

Email is the default messaging channel in PostHog.  

You can use it to send **[drip campaigns](/docs/workflows/email-drip-campaign), transactional messages, or announcements** directly from the Workflow Builder.

### Configure the channel

To configure the channel, you need to provide the following details:

- Enter your **from name** (e.g. `PostHog Team`).
- Enter your **from email** (e.g. `team@yourdomain.com`).

This is the address that recipients will see in their inbox.

### Verify your domain

To maximize deliverability and avoid spam folders, you must verify your domain.

1. After adding your email address, PostHog shows DNS records for **SPF** and **DKIM**.
2. Copy these into your domain host (e.g. Cloudflare, GoDaddy).
3. Verification may take a few minutes to propagate.

Once verified, you'll see a green check mark in your settings.

<Step title="Create a template" badge="recommended">

Navigate to **Workflows** > **Library** tab > click **+ New template**.

- Give your template a name.
- Write your subject line and body content (HTML and text versions are supported).
- Use variables like `{{ person.name }}` to personalize your message. See the [template builder](/docs/workflows/template-builder) documentation for more information on available variables.

Save your template â€” you'll be able to select it later when you design a workflow.

You'll still be able to edit the message directly in the workflow builder.

</Step>

<Step title="Use in a workflow" badge="required">

Once your channel is created, you can use it in a workflow to deliver messages to your users.

<Step checkpoint title="Troubleshooting" subtitle="Common issues you may encounter">

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Emails not sending? | Check that your domain is verified and you've added the DNS records correctly. |
| Spam folder issues? | Ensure SPF/DKIM are valid, and consider setting up DMARC. |
| Variables not populating? | Confirm the property exists on the person profile (e.g. `person.name`). |

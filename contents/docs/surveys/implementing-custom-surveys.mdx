If you're using PostHog's [survey API](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#display-mode) to create a custom survey UI, there are 2 steps to integrating with PostHog:

## Step 1: Fetch active surveys

To fetch the surveys currently enabled for a user, call `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()`. 

Alternatively, if you wish to do survey targeting yourself, you can call `posthog.getSurveys()` to return a list of all surveys from PostHog.

Both methods return a callback with a `surveys` object:

```json
// Example surveys object:
[{
  "id": "your_survey_id",
  "name": "Your survey name",
  "description": "Metadata describing your survey",
  "type": "api", // can be either "api" or "popover"
  "linked_flag_key": null, //Linked feature flag key, if any.
  "targeting_flag_key": "your_survey_targeting_flag_key",
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "single_choice",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "question": "Are you enjoying PostHog?"
    }
  ],
  "conditions": null,
  "start_date": "2023-09-19T13:10:49.505000Z",
  "end_date": null
}]
```

Thus you can use show your user a survey using code like this:

```js-web
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys((surveys) => {
    // Make sure you filter for surveys that are of type `"api"`. 
    // This prevents accidentally showing popover surveys to your users.
    const filteredSurveys = surveys.filter(survey => survey.type === 'api'));
    if (filteredSurveys.length > 0) {
        // show the survey using your custom UI
        showSurvey(filteredSurveys[0]);
    }
})
```

> **Important:** `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()` will always true if a user meets the targeting conditions, even if a user has already seen, dismissed or responded to a survey. 

> **Note:** If you're using a URL or selector targeting options, you'll need to poll `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()` to get the most updated results.

## Step 2: Capture survey events

To show survey results in PostHog, you need to capture user interactions with your surveys using the following 3 events:

```js-web
// 1. When a user is shown a survey
posthog.capture("survey shown", {
    $survey_id: {survey.id} // required
})

// 2. When a user has dismissed a survey
posthog.capture("survey dismissed", {
    $survey_id: {survey.id} // required
})

// 3. When a user has responded to a survey
posthog.capture("survey sent", {
    $survey_id: {survey.id} // required
    $survey_response: {survey_response} // required
})
```

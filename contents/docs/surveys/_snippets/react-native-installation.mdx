## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

> üöß **NOTE:** Mobile surveys is **currently available on [React Native](/docs/surveys/installation?tab=React%20Native)**, which is in beta. We'd love to hear your feedback on betas via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Asurveys%3Alow) or one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

> Requires PostHog React Native SDK version >= [3.12.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.

import ReactNativeInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-react-native.mdx"

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Step two: Add the Surveys Provider

Add `PostHogSurveyProvider` to your app anywhere inside `PostHogProvider`. This component fetches surveys. It also acts as the root for where popover surveys are rendered.

```ts
<PostHogProvider /*... your config ...*/>
  <PostHogSurveyProvider>{children}</PostHogSurveyProvider>
</PostHogProvider>
```

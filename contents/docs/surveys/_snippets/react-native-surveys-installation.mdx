## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

> 🚧 **Note:** Mobile surveys for React Native for is currently in **beta**. We'd love to hear your feedback on betas via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Asurveys%3Alow) or one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

Using surveys requires PostHog's React Native SDK version >= [3.12.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/releases). It's recommended to always use the latest version.

import ReactNativeInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-react-native.mdx"

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Step two: Install surveys dependencies

```bash
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context react-native-svg
# or
npm i -s react-native-safe-area-context react-native-svg
```

## Step three: Add the surveys provider

Add `PostHogSurveyProvider` to your app anywhere inside `PostHogProvider`. This component fetches surveys. It also acts as the root for where popover surveys are rendered.

```ts
<PostHogProvider /*... your config ...*/>
  <PostHogSurveyProvider>{children}</PostHogSurveyProvider>
</PostHogProvider>
```

If you're not using the `PostHogProvider`, add `PostHogSurveyProvider` to your app anywhere inside your app root component.

```ts
<YourAppRoot>
  <PostHogSurveyProvider>
</YourAppRoot>
```

You can also pass your `client` instance to the `PostHogSurveyProvider`.

```ts
<PostHogSurveyProvider client={posthog}>
```

## Troubleshooting

- Update your SDK.
- Run a clean build if you experience issues.
- For surveys not shown, be sure to set up the [surveys provider](/docs/surveys/installation#step-three-add-the-surveys-provider).
- If you have enabled surveys using feature flags, the flags are evaluated on the device once the PostHog SDK starts as early as possible. The SDK might be using the cached flags from the previous SDK start. If you have changed the flag or its condition, kill and reopen the app to force a new SDK start at least once.
    - This will also happen in production, and you might experience some delay for the new flag/conditions to take effect on your users.
    - Survey feature flag evaluation does not capture `$feature_flag_called` events, so the `Usage` tab on the feature flag page won't show anything.

## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

> üöß **Note:** Mobile surveys for React Native for is currently in **beta**. We'd love to hear your feedback on betas via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Asurveys%3Alow) or one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

Using surveys requires PostHog's React Native SDK version >= [3.12.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/releases). It's recommended to always use the latest version.

import ReactNativeInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-react-native.mdx"

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Step two: Install surveys dependencies

```bash
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context react-native-svg
# or
npm i -s react-native-safe-area-context react-native-svg
```

## Step three: Add the surveys provider

Add `PostHogSurveyProvider` to your app anywhere inside `PostHogProvider`. This component fetches surveys. It also acts as the root for where popover surveys are rendered.

```ts
<PostHogProvider /*... your config ...*/>
  <PostHogSurveyProvider>{children}</PostHogSurveyProvider>
</PostHogProvider>
```

If you're not using the `PostHogProvider`, add `PostHogSurveyProvider` to your app anywhere inside your app root component.

```ts
<YourAppRoot>
  <PostHogSurveyProvider>
</YourAppRoot>
```

You can also pass your `client` instance to the `PostHogSurveyProvider`.

```ts
<PostHogSurveyProvider client={posthog}>
```

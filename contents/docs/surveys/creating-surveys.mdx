To create a new survey, go to the [surveys tab](https://us.posthog.com/surveys) in the PostHog app, and click on the "New survey" button in the top right. This presents you with a collection of [survey templates](/templates?filter=type&value=survey) or you can click "Create blank survey" in the top right to create your own.

After choosing one, you are brought to a form where you can complete the details of your new survey:

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={newSurveyLight}
    imageDark={newSurveyDark}
    alt="Create a survey"
    classes="rounded"
/>

Here's a breakdown of each field in the form:

### Presentation

There are three options for displaying a survey:

1. **Popover:** Use PostHog's prebuilt user interfaces to show surveys as a popover in the bottom corner of the screen.

2. **API:** Implement your own survey UI and use PostHog to handle display logic, capturing results, and analytics.

3. **Feedback button:** Set up a survey based on your own custom button or our prebuilt feedback tab.

### Steps

Steps is where you set up your question(s), label, choice(s), description, button text, and confirmation message. You must [subscribe](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing) to surveys to add multiple questions.

You can also add [conditional logic](/docs/surveys/conditional-questions) to display certain questions.

> **Tip:** The description supports HTML, so you can do things like add images with an `<img>` tag.

PostHog supports multiple question types which are all available for both popover and API display modes.

### Customization

Customization enables you to change the look, feel, and timing of your popover survey:

- The color of the background, border, and buttons.
- The position of the popover at the bottom of the screen.
- The placeholder text.
- The visibility of the PostHog branding.
- Whether to shuffle the order of the choices and questions.
- The delay (in seconds) before the survey appears on the page.
- Whether the confirmation message auto disappears after 5 seconds.

### Display conditions

This specifies the conditions a user must meet to be shown the survey. A user must meet **ALL** the conditions to be eligible.

You can display your survey to specific users based on:

- **Linked feature flag:** Whether a user has a specific [feature flag](/docs/feature-flags) enabled. For example, if you're rolling out a new landing page using a feature flag `new-landing-page`, you can gather feedback only from users who have that flag enabled. This is also a way to show surveys to cohorts (but it must be a [non-behavioral one](/docs/feature-flags/common-questions#why-cant-i-use-a-cohort-with-behavioral-filters-in-my-feature-flag)).

- **URL targeting:** Show when URL either contains a string, exactly matches a string, matches a regex. The URL targeting is evaluated against `window.location.href`.

- **Device types targeting:** Show when the device type either contains a string, exactly matches a string or matches a regex. The device type targeting is evaluated by parsing the [userAgent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/userAgent) on the client-side, possible values are: Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, Console, and Wearable. You can also target device types using *Person and group properties* (Latest or Initial Device type), but these properties aren't immediately available on the first page load for unidentified persons. Only available from posthog-js version 1.214.0 forward.

- **Selector matches:** Whether a specific element exists or appears on the page with the specified class name or ID. For example, you can display a survey with `#my-button` or `.my-button` selector. This is useful for showing a survey after a user action.

- **Wait period**: Hide surveys from users who have seen a survey in the last X days. Note that a user who completes a survey are never shown the same survey again, even if no wait period is set.

- **Person and group properties:** If you are capturing identified events, you can display a survey to users who have specific [person](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties) or [group properties](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics#how-to-set-group-properties). For example, you can target a survey to users who have a property `is_paying=true`. This also includes a percentage rollout option. The person and group properties are evaluated with internal feature flags.

- **User sends events:** Display a survey to users who have sent a specific event during their session.

### Completion conditions

This enables you to stop your survey once you receive a specific number of responses. Note that because it takes time for PostHog to process responses, this is a rough guideline. Your survey might receive slightly more responses than you set. The completion conditions properties are evaluated with internal feature flags.

## Repeating surveys

By default, surveys are shown once to each user until they either dismiss it or complete it. After that, they won't see the survey again.

You can also configure surveys to repeat at specific intervals, which is useful for gathering feedback from users on a regular basis.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={repeatingSurveyLight}
    imageDark={repeatingSurveyDark}
    alt="Repeating surveys"
    classes="rounded"
/>

For example, you can configure settings like:
- **Repeat this survey `3` times, once every `30` days**: The survey will be shown to a user up to 3 times total, with a 30-day gap between each showing.

| Date | Event | Explanation |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Jan 1 | Survey shown and completed | First showing of the survey. User completes it, starting the 30-day timer |
| Jan 2-30 | No survey shown | Within 30-day waiting period after first completion |
| Jan 31 | Survey becomes eligible | 30 days have passed since first completion |
| Feb 15 | Survey shown and completed | User visits site and completes survey for the second time |
| Feb 16-Mar 16 | No survey shown | Within 30-day waiting period after second completion |
| Mar 17 | Survey becomes eligible | 30 days have passed since second completion |
| Apr 1 | Survey shown and completed | User completes survey for the third and final time |
| After Apr 1 | Survey never shown again for this user | Maximum number of repetitions (3) reached |

A survey is considered "shown" when a user either completes or dismisses it. The repeat interval timer starts from that moment. For example, if you set a survey to repeat every 90 days and a user completes it on January 1st, they won't see it again until April 1st, regardless of how many times they visit your site in between.

> **Note:** Users must still match any display conditions you've set each time the survey becomes eligible to show again.

## Launching your survey

Once you've set up your survey, click "Save as draft" to save your survey. This enables you to review any changes before launching. Then, when you're ready to launch, click the "Launch" button.

If you've created a [popover survey](#presentation), your survey will begin showing immediately to users matching your display conditions.

If you've created an [API survey](#presentation), you'll need to add your [custom survey code](/docs/surveys/implementing-custom-surveys) before launching.

## How PostHog handles partial survey responses

You can enable partial responses in the "Completion conditions" section of the survey. This option is enabled by default for all new surveys. Please note that partial responses require `posthog-js` version `1.240.0` or higher and are currently only supported in `posthog-js` library.

**If partial responses are disabled, PostHog sends a single `survey sent` event**. This event is triggered once the user answers the last question of the survey. It contains all the user's responses. The `$survey_completed` property in this event will be `true`.

**When partial responses are enabled (default behavior for new surveys):**
If partial responses are enabled, PostHog tracks user progress as follows:

1.  **Initial Response:** The first `survey sent` event is triggered as soon as the user answers at least one question. This initial event includes the answer(s) provided up to that point. The `$survey_completed` property in this event will be `false`.
2.  **Subsequent Responses:** For each *additional* question the user answers, another `survey sent` event is captured. Each of these events will contain *all* responses submitted by the user for that survey instance up to that point, and `$survey_completed` will remain `false`.
3.  **Full Completion:** When the user fully completes and submits the survey, a final `survey sent` event is sent. This event will again include all their answers, and the `$survey_completed` property will now be `true`.

**The `$survey_submission_id`:**
All `survey sent` events triggered during a single user's attempt to complete a survey (whether partial or complete) share the same unique `$survey_submission_id`.

**Billing for partial responses:**
We charge based on unique survey submissions, not individual `survey sent` events. Therefore, you are charged only once per unique `$survey_submission_id`. For example, if your survey has 5 questions and a user answers 3 of them (triggering multiple `survey sent` events with `$survey_completed: false`), you will still be charged for only one survey response, as all those events will share the same `$survey_submission_id`.

It is useful to be able to display survey questions conditionally. For example, you may want to ask certain questions based on the responses received. PostHog offers several ways to do this:

## Simple branching

For every question type, you can now define the next step to navigate to after a question is completed. Click on __After this question, go to:__, then choose the next step you want to transition to. The options are:

- Next question
- Any specific question
- Confirmation message (if present) or End

After the given question is completed, the chosen next step will be followed.

## Response-based conditions

For the **single choice** and **rating** question types, you can define the next step based on the response received. 

Click on **After this question, go to:**, and then choose **Specific question based on answer**. Depending on your question type, this will present the following options:

1. For the __Single choice__ question type, you can specify the next step based on the selected answer.

2. For the __Rating__ question type, you can specify the next step based on the response bucket received. For example, for a rating question with a scale from 1 to 5, the responses will be bucketed into categories: _negative_, _neutral_, and _positive_. The conditions are executed based on which bucket the individual response falls into.

__Note__: If you intend for a question to be the last one, but it is not the final question in the list, you need to explicitly set the branching to the __Confirmation message__ (if present) or __End__. By default, a question will branch to the next question unless specified otherwise.

## Testing
We currently don't have the ability to test the survey flow interactively via preview, but we will add this feature soon. In the meantime, we recommend testing the branching flows by first releasing the survey to yourself.

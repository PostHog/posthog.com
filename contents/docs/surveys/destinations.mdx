It can be useful to send survey responses to external [destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations). For example, to receive [Slack](/tutorials/slack-surveys) notification or send a [Zapier zap](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/destinations/zapier) whenever a user responds to your survey. 

To do this:

1. Go to the [data pipeline destinations tab](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/destinations) 

2. Search for the destination you want and click **+Create** (or click **Create** on **HTTP Webhook** for custom destinations) 

3. Follow the steps to integrate with destination.

4. Under **Match event and actions**, select **survey sent**.

You can extract the following properties from surveys:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `event.properties.$survey_name` | The name of the survey |
| `event.properties.$survey_response_{response_key}` | The response to a specific question. To find the response key, go to your survey page and click on the button **Copy survey response key**. There's one for each question in your survey. |
| `person.name` and other person properties | The name of the person who responded and other properties |

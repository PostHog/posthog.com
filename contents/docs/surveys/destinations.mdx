It can be useful to send survey responses to external [destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations). For example, you can receive [Slack](/tutorials/slack-surveys) notifications or trigger [Zapier zaps](/tutorials/zapier-surveys) whenever users responds to your survey.

To do this:

1. Go to the [data pipeline destinations tab](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/destinations).

2. Search for the destination you want and click **+ Create** (or click **Create** on **HTTP Webhook** for custom destinations).

3. Follow the steps to integrate with destination.

4. Under **Match event and actions**, select **survey sent**.

## Available properties

You can extract the following properties from surveys:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `event.properties.$survey_name` | The name of the survey |
| `event.properties.$survey_questions` | An array of objects containing the following survey question properties: `id`, `index`, and `question` |
| `event.properties.$survey_response_{response_key}` | The response to a specific question. To find `response_key`, go to your survey page and click on the button **Copy survey response key**. There's one for each question in your survey. `response_key` is identical to the corresponding survey question ID |
| `event.properties.$survey_completed` | Whether the survey was completed. Relevant for surveys with partial responses. This will be `true` if the user has answered all questions. |

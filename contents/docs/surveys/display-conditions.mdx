## Survey display conditions

When you create a survey, it'll save as a draft until you're ready to launch it. You can display your survey to specific users based on:

1. **Page URL contains.** You can display a survey to a specific page URL, or a page URL that contains a specific string. For example, you can display a survey on `https://posthog.com/docs` or `https://posthog.com/docs/*` with the string "/docs".
2. **Selector.** You can display a survey based on whether a specific element appears on your page with either class name or ID. For example, you can display a survey based on the presence of `#my-button` or `.my-button`.
3. **Linked feature flag.** You can display a survey to users who have a specific feature flag enabled. For example, you're rolling out a new feature flag "new-landing-page" and want to gather feedback only from users who have that flag enabled.
4. **User/group properties.** You can display a survey to users who have a specific user or group property. For example, you can display a survey to users who have a property `is_paying` set to `true`.

> All display conditions behave in a "AND" manner, meaning that a survey will only be shown to a user if _all_ of the above conditions are met.

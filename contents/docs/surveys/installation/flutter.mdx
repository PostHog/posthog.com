<Step title="Add PostHog to your app" badge="required">

Using it requires PostHog's Flutter SDK version >= 5.8.0, but it's recommended to always use [the latest version](/docs/sdk-doctor).

> **Note:** For mobile surveys, you must setup the SDK manually.

<Step title="Install PosthogObserver" badge="required">

For surveys to be shown, you need to add the `PosthogObserver` to your app. The observer allows PostHog to determine the appropriate context for displaying surveys.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PostHogWidget(
      child: MaterialApp(
        navigatorObservers: [PosthogObserver()],
        title: 'My App',
        home: const HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

If you're using `go_router`, check [this page](/docs/libraries/flutter#capturing-screen-views) to learn how to set up the `PosthogObserver`.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Configuration

> **Important:** For Flutter Web, surveys are powered by the JavaScript Web SDK, so any Flutter-specific survey configuration will be ignored. Please refer to the [Web installation guide](/docs/surveys/installation/web) for proper setup.

Surveys are enabled by default. If you want to disable surveys, you can do so when setting up your SDK instance:

```dart
final config = PostHogConfig('<ph_project_api_key>');

config.surveys = false; // Disable surveys
```

## Limitations

- On Android, requires API >= 26.
- On iOS, minimum deployment target is [iOS13](/docs/libraries/ios).
- On Web, surveys are powered by the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/surveys/installation/web).
- Requires PostHog Flutter SDK version >= 5.8.0

## Troubleshooting

- Update your SDK and iOS Pods.
- Make sure to set the minimum platform version to iOS 13.0 in your Podfile.
- Make sure you have disabled automatic SDK initialization.
- Run a clean build if you experience issues.
- If surveys are not being displayed when triggered, make sure you have installed the [PosthogObserver](/docs/surveys/installation/flutter#step-two-install-posthogobserver).
  - Using [navigationObservers](/docs/libraries/flutter#capturing-screen-views#using-navigatorobservers)
  - Using [go_router](/docs/libraries/flutter#capturing-screen-views#using-go-router)
- If you are using multiple navigation observers and encounter a log message `[PostHog] Cannot show survey: No valid context found...`, try placing `PosthogObserver` first in the list of observers. We've noticed that order sometimes matters due to potential interference.

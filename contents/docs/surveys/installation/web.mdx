> **Important:** When installing PostHog via a package manager, surveys require `posthog-js v1.81.1+`. It's recommended to install the latest version.

To get started with surveys, add PostHog to your web app by installing our [Javascript web SDK](/docs/libraries/js) (if you haven't already). There are two methods to do so:

import WebInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-web.mdx'

<WebInstall />

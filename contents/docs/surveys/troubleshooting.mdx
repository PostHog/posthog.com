Having trouble with surveys? Below are some tips for getting past some common issues

The most common solution is...

### Update the PostHog snippet or JavaScript Web SDK

Surveys requires either the latest version of the [PostHog snippet](/docs/libraries/js#option-1-add-the-javascript-snippet-to-your-html) or version 1.81.3 or greater of `posthog-js` to be installed on your website.

We're always making improvements to the surveys feature, so you'll want to make sure that you're running the latest version.

To check the version that you're using, you can run the following in your browser console:

```js
window.posthog.LIB_VERSION
```

## Surveys still not showing up

If updating PostHog doesn't solve your problem, there are a few reasons why your survey might not be showing up:

### 1. Configuration is off

Surveys are enabled through the surveys opt in toggle in the [app](https://app.posthog.com/surveys). If you're not seeing any surveys, make sure that this toggle is enabled.

You can read more about [`posthog-js` configurations here](/docs/integrate/client/js#config).

> **Note:** Surveys make use of feature flags internally when determining if a user should be presented with a survey. If your SDK configuration sets `advanced_disable_feature_flags` to `true`, this will also disable surveys for all users.

### 2. Content security policy

When surveys are enabled, `posthog-js` will fetch a `survey.js` script from the PostHog server. It is not included in the default `posthog-js` installation to minimize the default bundle size.

Depending on your content security policy, this script may be blocked. If you have a `default-src`, `script-src`, `script-src-elem`, or `connect-src` directive in your CSP, you may need to ensure that PostHog domains are permitted (see [CSP documentation](/docs/advanced/content-security-policy)).

If PostHog is being blocked by your content security policy, you should see an error message in your developer console with more details.


### 3. Proxies

If you're running behind a proxy, the `/static/survey.js` endpoint may be blocked. Read more about [how to configure your proxy to allow this endpoint](/docs/self-host/configure/running-behind-proxy#public-endpoints).

### 4. Ad or tracking blockers

Some ad or tracking blockers block PostHog from fetching `posthog-js`. If you're testing your app locally, you may need to disable any ad/tracking blockers that you're running in your browser.

In production, using a [reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy) can help prevent this.

## Debugging surveys in console

You can call `getActiveMatchingSurveys` in your browser console to see which surveys are currently active for the user. If the method doesn't exist, it means that you're not running the latest version of `posthog-js`.  

```js
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys(surveys => console.log(surveys))
```

### I set a survey activate based on an event, why does it show up to users who haven't sent that event?

Check your `posthog-js` version. If its lower than `v1.143.0`, please upgrade your installation of `posthog-js` to the latest to support event based surveys.

The event must be captured on the user's session by the `posthog-js` SDK.

Backend events aren't supported yet, upvote this [issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/25433) if that would be useful for you.

### I set a survey to be activated based on an action. Why does it shows up to users who haven't performed that action?

Check your `posthog-js` version.  If its lower than `v1.151.0`, please upgrade your installation of `posthog-js` to the latest to support action based surveys.

### Why am I getting a feature flags error on my survey?

If you're seeing: `Update survey failed: Cohort with behavioral filters cannot be used in feature flags.` or similar, it's because surveys are powered by feature flags for person property targeting.

Currently we do not support behavioral cohorts in flags which is why you might see an error if setting a person property that contains a behavioral cohort in your survey.

#### Will I be double charged for feature flags if I use surveys?

No, you will not.

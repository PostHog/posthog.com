title: Surveys (beta)
---

Surveys are a great way to collect qualitative feedback from your users. Qualitative feedback enables you to gain more insight into your users' and how they view their experience with your product.

With PostHog, you can target surveys based on page URL, selectors, feature flag, and user properties. Then, you can analyze the results right in PostHog too!

## Enable the survey beta

To access the survey beta, click your profile icon in the top right of your PostHog instance, select "Enable beta features," then activate "Surveys."

## Setting up surveys

Setting up surveys is easy, and there are two ways to do it. The first option will enable you to get started quickly with a pre-built survey, while the second option involves creating your own UI components.

### Option 1 (recommended)

1. Make sure you've enabled and are up to date with the surveys app in your project's apps.

2. You must have the `opt_in_site_apps` option enabled in your PostHog initialization code.

```js-web
posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", { 
    "api_host": "<ph_instance_address>",
    "opt_in_site_apps": true 
})
```

3. That's it! Now you can go [create a survey in PostHog](https://app.posthog.com/surveys).

### Option 2 (custom UI component)

1. Make sure you're up to date on PostHog's [JavaScript web library](/docs/libraries/js). Surveys requires version 1.67.1, or later.

2. Call `posthog.getSurveys()` and get a list of all surveys back, and `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()` to get a list of active matching surveys that should display for the current user client.

```js-web
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys((surveys) => {
    // do something with surveys
})
```

> **Note:** You'll need to handle whether a user has seen a survey already or not manually if you're using this option. The [survey app](https://github.com/PostHog/feature-surveys/blob/main/site.ts) uses `localStorage` to keep track of this, which you can implement similarly in your code.

3. In order for survey responses to be recorded, you'll need to send in a "survey sent" capture call event with the survey's name, ID, and any properties you'd want.

For example, if the survey's name is "New feature beta interest", you'd send in a capture call like this:

```js-web
posthog.capture("New feature beta interest survey sent", {
    $survey_id: {survey.id} // required
    $survey_response: {survey_response} // required
    $survey_name: {survey.name} // optional
})
```

## Creating a survey

To create a new survey, go to the surveys page in PostHog and click "New survey". You'll be prompted to enter a name for your survey, optional description, and what type of survey you'd like to create.
On the right side of the page, you'll see a preview of what your survey will look like along with appearance customization options.

### Survey targeting

When you create a survey, it'll automatically save as a draft until you're ready to launch it. You can target your survey to specific users based on:

1. Page url contains. You can target a survey to a specific page url, or a page url that contains a specific string. For example, you can target a survey to `https://posthog.com/docs` or `https://posthog.com/docs/*` with the string "/docs".
2. Selector. You can target a survey based on whether a specific element appears on your page with either class name or ID. For example, you can target a survey with `#my-button` or `.my-button`.
3. Linked feature flag. You can target a survey to users who have a specific feature flag enabled. For example, you're rolling out a new feature flag "new-landing-page" and you want to gather feedback from users who have that flag enabled.
4. User/group properties. You can target a survey to users who have a specific user or group property. For example, you can target a survey to users who have a property `is_paying` set to `true`.

All of the above properties behave in a "AND" manner, meaning that a survey will only be shown to a user if all of the above conditions are met.

## Survey events

When survey responses are collected, they're simply stored as PostHog events. We provide an easy way for you to view the responses on the survey page, but you can also view them in any manner you'd like with the PostHog UI.

We have "survey shown", "survey dismissed", and "survey sent" events. All three events will contain the `$survey_id` and `$survey_name` properties, and "survey sent" will also contain the `$survey_response` property.

title: Surveys (beta)
---

Surveys are a great way to collect qualitative feedback from your users. Qualitative feedback allows you to gain more descriptive insight into your users' experience.

With surveys you'll be able to ask your users questions, target based on page url, selectors, feature flag, and user properties, and then analyze the results.

## Getting started

Setting up surveys is easy! We recommend option 1 if you're just getting started, but if you want to build your own custom survey components, option 2 will let you do that.

### Option 1 (recommended)

1. Make sure you've installed and enabled the surveys app in your project's apps.

2. You must have the `opt_in_site_apps` option enabled in your PostHog's initialization code.

```js
posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", { 
    "api_host": "<ph_instance_address>",
    "opt_in_site_apps": true 
})
```

3. That's it! Now you can create surveys in the PostHog UI.

### Option 2

1. Make sure you're up to date on PostHog's [JavaScript library](/docs/libraries/js), or at least on version 1.67.1.

2. You should be able to call `posthog.getSurveys()` and get a list of all surveys back, and `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()` to get a list of active matching surveys that should display for the current user client.

```js
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys((surveys) => {
    // do something with surveys
})
```

Note: You'll need to handle whether a user has seen a survey already or not manually if you're using this option. The [survey app](https://github.com/PostHog/feature-surveys/blob/main/site.ts) uses localStorage to keep track of this, which you can implement similarly in your code.

3. In order for survey responses to be recorded, you'll need to send in a capture call event with the survey's name and and any properties you'd want.

For example, if the survey's name is "New feature beta interest", you'd send in a capture call like this:

```js
posthog.capture("New feature beta interest survey sent", {
    $survey_id: {survey.id} // required
    $survey_response: {survey_response} // required
})
```

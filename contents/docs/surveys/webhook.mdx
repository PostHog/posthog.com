It can be useful to receive notifications whenever a user responds to your survey. For example, messages containing their response can be sent to Slack, Discord, or Teams. 

To set this up, follow the below steps:

## Step 1: Set up your PostHog Webhook

First you need to set up an [webhook endpoint](/docs/webhooks) where you'll receive survey responses. You can use your own custom endpoint, or you can follow our guides to set one up for [Slack](/docs/webhooks/slack), [Discord](/docs/webhooks/discord), or [Teams](/docs/webhooks/microsoft-teams).

## Step 2: Create an action for survey responses

Next, set up an [action](/docs/data/actions) to post survey events to our webhook. To do this: 

1. Navigate to the [actions tab in Data Management](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/actions) and click **New action** in the top right.
2. Select **From event or pageview** when prompted.
3. Under **Match Group #1**, click **All events** and select `survey sent` as the event name.
4. Check the box which says `Post to webhook when this action is triggered`.
5. In the **message format** text field, set the text to `New response for [event.properties.$survey_name] from user [person]: "[event.properties.$survey_response]"`

Save your action and you will now begin receiving notifications whenever users respond to your survey.

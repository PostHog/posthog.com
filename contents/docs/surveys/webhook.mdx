It can be useful to receive notifications whenever a user responds to your survey. For example, messages containing their response can be sent to [Slack](/tutorials/slack-surveys), Discord, Teams, or your own custom destination.

## Using webhooks

For Slack, Discord, and Teams, you can set up and use our webhook. To set this up, follow the below steps:

### Step 1: Set up your PostHog Webhook

First you need to set up an [webhook endpoint](/docs/webhooks) where you'll receive survey responses. You can use your own custom endpoint, or you can follow our guides to set one up for [Slack](/docs/webhooks/slack), [Discord](/docs/webhooks/discord), or [Teams](/docs/webhooks/microsoft-teams).

### Step 2: Create an action for survey responses

Next, set up an [action](/docs/data/actions) to post survey events to our webhook. To do this: 

1. Navigate to the [actions tab in Data Management](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/actions) and click **New action** in the top right.
2. Select **From event or pageview** when prompted.
3. Under **Match Group #1**, click **All events** and select `survey sent` as the event name.
4. Check the box which says `Post to webhook when this action is triggered`.
5. In the **message format** text field, set the text to `New response for [event.properties.$survey_name] from user [person]: "[event.properties.$survey_response]"`

Save your action and you will now begin receiving notifications whenever users respond to your survey.

## Using realtime destinations

Our new [realtime destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations) are currently in preview. These provide customizable destinations, more formatting options, a revamped configuration UI. We can use them to send survey responses to Slack or any other destination that supports webhooks.

To do this, start by enabling the **Pipeline destinations 3000** feature preview.

Next, go to the [data pipeline destinations tab](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/destinations) and search for the **Slack** destination (or **HTTP Webhook** for custom) and click **+ Create**. On the creation screen:

1. Follow the steps to integrate with your Slack workspace if you haven't already and then select it.

2. Make sure the PostHog integration is added to the channel you want to send messages to and select it.

3. Under **Match event and actions**, select **survey sent**. 

4. Under **Blocks**, modify the text to include the survey name and response. For example:

```json
{
  "text": {
    "text": "*{person.name}* sent a response to {event.properties.$survey_name}: {event.properties.$survey_response}",
    "type": "mrkdwn"
  },
  "type": "section"
},
```

5. Customize the name and description, and press **Create & enable**.

You can then test the destination and it will start sending survey responses to Slack.

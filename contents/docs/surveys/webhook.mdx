It can be useful to receive notifications whenever a user responds to your survey. For example, messages containing their response can be sent to [Slack](/tutorials/slack-surveys), Discord, Teams, or your own custom destination.

To do this, go to the [data pipeline destinations tab](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/destinations) and search for the **Slack** destination (or **HTTP Webhook** for custom) and click **+ Create**. On the creation screen:

1. Follow the steps to integrate with your Slack workspace if you haven't already and then select it.

2. Make sure the PostHog integration is added to the channel you want to send messages to and select it.

3. Under **Match event and actions**, select **survey sent**. 

4. Under **Blocks**, modify the text to include the survey name and response. For example:

```json
{
  "text": {
    "text": "*{person.name}* sent a response to {event.properties.$survey_name}: {event.properties.$survey_response}",
    "type": "mrkdwn"
  },
  "type": "section"
},
```

5. Customize the name and description, and press **Create & enable**.

You can then test the destination and it will start sending survey responses to Slack.

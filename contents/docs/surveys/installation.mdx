Surveys are a great tool to collect qualitative feedback from your users.

To get started with surveys, add PostHog to your web app by installing our JavaScript snippet or the `posthog-js` library via a package manager.

> **Important:** When installing PostHog via a package manager, surveys require `posthog-js v1.67+`.

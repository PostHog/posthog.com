title: Initial setup
---

There are two ways to set up surveys:

1. Get started quickly with a pre-built survey
1. Create your own UI components

## Option 1 (recommended): Pre-built survey

1. Make sure you've enabled the surveys app in your project's apps.

2. You must have the `opt_in_site_apps` option enabled in your PostHog initialization code and `posthog-js` version 1.67.1+ or the [JavaScript snippet](/docs/getting-started/install#add-to-your-website--app) that includes `getActiveMatchingSurveys` and `getSurveys`.

```js-web
posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", { 
    "api_host": "<ph_instance_address>",
    "opt_in_site_apps": true 
})
```

3. That's it! Now you can go [create a survey in PostHog](https://app.posthog.com/surveys).

## Option 2: Custom UI components

1. Make sure you're up to date on PostHog's [JavaScript web library](/docs/libraries/js). Surveys requires version 1.67.1, or later.

2. After creating your survey on PostHog app, call `posthog.getSurveys()` and get a list of all surveys back if you wish to do your own matching, or `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()` to get a list of active matching surveys that should display for the current user client.

2.5. Make sure you filter for surveys that are of the type "api".

```js-web
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys((surveys) => {
    // do something with surveys
    // handleSurveys(surveys.filter(survey => survey.type === 'api'))
})
```

> **Note:** You'll need to handle whether a user has seen a survey already or not manually if you're using this option. The [survey app](https://github.com/PostHog/feature-surveys/blob/main/site.ts) uses `localStorage` to keep track of this, which you can implement similarly in your code.
> **Note:** If you're using a URL or selector targeting option, you'll need to poll with `posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys()` to get the most updated survey results.

3. In order for survey responses to be recorded, you'll need to send in a "survey sent" capture call event with the survey's name, ID, and any properties you'd want.

```js-web
posthog.capture("survey sent", {
    $survey_id: {survey.id} // required
    $survey_response: {survey_response} // required
    $survey_name: {survey.name} // optional
})
```

Surveys that are shown should be captured with a "survey shown" event and those that are dismissed, with a "survey dismissed" event similar to the above.

> PostHog currently supports surveys with either a single text input, or a link to another page (such as a form, or scheduling platform), so be sure to use the syntax above in order to track results. We'll be adding more survey types soon!

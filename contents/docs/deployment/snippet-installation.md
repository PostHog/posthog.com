The easiest way to get going is to add a JavaScript snippet to your application.

### Finding the Snippet

This snippet will be provided to you during setup, but, if you need to access it afterwards, you can find it under 'Project' -> 'Settings':

### Adding the snippet to your website

Having copied the snippet from the Settings page, you should now paste this within the `<head>` tags of your website, ideally just above the closing `</head>` tag. You will need to do this for all pages that you wish to track. 

## Website vs App

We recommend adding the PostHog snippet both on your homepage and your application (if you have one). That means you'll be able to follow a user from the moment they come onto your website, all the way through Sign Up and their actual usage of your product.

## Adding Multiple URLs 

PostHog supports tracking across multiple URLs and domains. Also on your Project Settings page, you are able to add more URLs that you wish to track.

###  Ignore/Censure elements
PostHog puts a great amount of effort into making sure it doesn't capture any sensitive data from your website. If there are other elements you don't want to be captured, you can add the `ph-no-capture` class name.

```html
<button class='ph-no-capture'>Sensitive information here</button>
```

### Alternatives to the snippet

You can choose not to use a JavaScript snippet, and can instead use one of our [many integrations](/docs/integrations) or our [API](/docs/api/overview).

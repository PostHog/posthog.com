## Step By Step Installation

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/render-examples/posthog)

1. Click Deploy to Render above.

2. Follow the prompts to create an account if you haven't already and approve the creation of your Posthog services.

    `Note: Because Posthog requires a higher tier plan, you will be asked to add a card. You won't be charged for your services until your trial ends.`

3. That's it! Once your deploy has completed, you will be able to access your Posthog instance by going to the URL found on the service dashboard.

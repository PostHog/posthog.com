> Looking to filter, transform, or export data in PostHog? Check out our [data pipeline docs](/docs/cdp) for all the details.

Site apps enable you easily add functionality to your site without extra code. They are injected through the `posthog-js` library or snippet and can be used to show content or banners on your site.

## Enabling apps

Head to 'Data pipelines' -> 'Apps' on the left sidebar in the PostHog app. Here you can install official PostHog apps.

If you're self-hosting, you can install a custom app by pasting a link to its public repository, or write your own app directly in PostHog.

## Self-host app troubleshooting

If you're having issues getting apps to work on your self-hosted instance of PostHog, check out our [troubleshooting guide](/docs/cdp/enabling).

### What does the PagerDuty Connector do?

This app alerts PagerDuty when a PostHog insights/trends graph goes below or above a threshold.

Example use cases:

-   Alert when there is no $pageviews captured on my site the past hour,
-   Alert when the rate of $billing_error events crosses a threshold.

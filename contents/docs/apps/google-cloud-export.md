### What does the Google Cloud Storage Export app do?

The Google Cloud Storage Export app enables you to send events from PostHog to a Google Cloud Storage bucket upon ingestion.

The Google Cloud Storage Export app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket you want to export to.

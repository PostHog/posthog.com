This app enhances incoming events by including browser & OS details from the `$useragent` property.

> **Note: ** This app is generally only needed when using clients that don't already set these properties, or when sending events directly from the server.

This app extracts the following properties from the provided `$useragent`:

| Property | Description | Example|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$browser` | Name of the browser for the user | Chrome, Firefox |
| `$browser_version` | The version of the browser that was used | 70, 79 |
| `$os` | The operating system of the user | Windows, Mac OS X |
| `$browser_type` | The type of client that made the request | bot, browser |

### Using the User Agent Populator

This app works by parsing the `$useragent` property on events as they are ingested.
As a result, if an event is ingested without the `$useragent` (or `$user-agent`) property set, this app will do nothing.
This property can be set using any of our [client](/docs/integrate#client-libraries) or [server](/docs/integrate#server-libraries) libraries.

> **Note: ** Most of our client libraries will already automatically extract the `$browser`, `$browser_version`, and `$os` properties, so there is no need to set the `$useragent` property when using these libraries.

One common use-case for this app is populating client information when sending events from the server-side. Typically, a `UserAgent` header will be set when a client sends a request to your server, which your server can then forward to PostHog with the `$useragent` property.
This gives you an idea of what types of clients are using your service and allows you to create insights that filter based on these properties.

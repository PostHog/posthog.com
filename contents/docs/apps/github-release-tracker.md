### What does the GitHub Release Tracker do?

This app enables you to tracker releases in GitHub as events in PostHog. This is useful for correlating releases with user behaviour or performance issues, for example.

### What are the requirements for this app?

The GitHub Release Tracker requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

If you want to track releases from a private GitHub repo, you'll also need access to it.

1. Log in to your PostHog instance

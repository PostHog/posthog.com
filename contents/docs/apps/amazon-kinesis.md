## What does the Amazon Kinesis Import app do?

This app imports event data into PostHog from an Amazon Kinesis stream. Kinesis Records must be delivered in a JSON schema in order to be imported.

## What are the requirements for this app?

Using the Amazon Kinesis Import app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

## How should I configure the Kinesis Record schema?

Kinesis Records must be delivered in a JSON schema.

You need to configure an `eventKey` that maps to the event name in PostHog. The `eventKey` can refer to a nested key.

You can optionally configure a comma-separated list of `additionalPropertyMappings`, that will map Kinesis Record keys to PostHog Event properties. The Kinesis Record keys can be nested keys, while the corresponding PostHog mapped keys cannot be nested.

For example, take the following Kinesis Record

```
// Kinesis Record
{
    ...
    "properties: {
        "eventName": "my posthog event",
        "userId": "$userId",
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

And the following configuration:

```
eventKey = properties.eventName
additionalPropertyMappings = properties.userId:distinct_id,properties.foo:foo
```

Will be parsed as:

```
// PostHog Event
{
    "event": "my posthog event",
    "properties: {
        "distinct_id": "$userId",
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

## What is the correct IAM policy?

You need to provide an AccessKeyID and a SecretAccessKey for a AWS IAM user with at least the following Kinesis Action rights:

```
DescribeStream
GetShardIterator
GetRecords
```

## What app parameters are available?

3. Follow the steps to configure the app.
4. Watch events roll in to PostHog.

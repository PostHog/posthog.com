### How do I configure the Intercom Connector for PostHog?

After you've pressed 'Install', you need to add your Intercom API key at the configuration step, as well as add triggering events you want to send to Intercom.

-   Intercom API Key (required): you can get this one from the [Intercom Developer Hub](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/), by creating a new app and receiving an API Key
-   Triggering events (required): A comma-separated list of PostHog events you want to send to Intercom (e.g.: `$identify,mycustomevent` ).

Additionally, you can set the following optional parameters:

-   Emails domain to skip (optional): A comma-separated list of email domains to ignore and not send events for in Intercom (e.g. `posthog.com,dev.posthog.com`).
-   Send events to European data storage (optional, default: False): Send events to api.eu.intercom.com, if you are using Intercom's European Data Hosting.

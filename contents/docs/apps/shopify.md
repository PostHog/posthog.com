### What does the Shopify Connector app do?

The Shopify Connector for PostHog enables you to sync customer and order data from Shopify, into PostHog.

This app will:

-   Associate your Shopify customers with PostHog users
-   Create a PostHog user from a Shopify customer if it doesn't exist
-   Create events for every new order

If there is an error while fetching orders, the next run of `runEveryMinute()` will try to re-read information from where it was previously interrupted.

Using this app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

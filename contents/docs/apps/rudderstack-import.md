### What does the Ruddestack Connect app do?

The Ruddestack Connect app enables you to send events to PostHog, via Rudderstack.

RudderStack is an open-source, customer data platform for developers. It allows you to collect and deliver customer event data to a variety of destinations across your growth, product, and marketing stack.

Using the Rudderstack connector requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

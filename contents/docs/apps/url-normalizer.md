### What does the URL Normalizer app do?

This app normalizes the format of URLs so you can more easily compare them in insights.

By default, the URL Normalizer converts all URLs to lowercase and strips trailing /s, overriding the old `current_url` property.

### What are the requirements for this app?

The URL Normalizer app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

### How do I install the URL Normalizer?

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'URL Normalizer' and select the app, press Install.

### How do I configure the URL Normalizer?

No configuration is needed. The URL Normalizer will automatically convert all URLs to lowercase and remove any trailing slashes.

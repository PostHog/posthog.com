Insights are the main building blocks of product analytics. 

They enable you visualize your [events](/docs/data/events) and [actions](/docs/data/actions) and analyze how people use your products.

## Types of insight

### Trends

<ProductScreenshot

  imageDark={ImgTrendsDark} 
  alt="Trends insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

[Trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends) enable you to track how metrics change over time and use formulas to create custom metrics.

### Funnels

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgFunnelLight} 
  imageDark={ImgFunnelDark} 
  alt="Funnels insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

Use [funnels](/docs/user-guides/funnels) to understand conversion between steps, identify possible causes of success or failure, and track how conversion changes over time.

### Retention

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgRetentionLight} 
  imageDark={ImgRetentionDark} 
  alt="Retention insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

[Retention](/docs/user-guides/retention) insights enable you to see how often users return and compare retention for between [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts).

### User Paths

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgUserPathsLight} 
  imageDark={ImgUserPathsDark} 
  alt="User paths insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

[Users paths](/docs/user-guides/paths) help you understand how users navigate your app or website, where they get stuck, or why they aren't discovering new features.

### Stickiness

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgStickinessLight} 
  imageDark={ImgStickinessDark} 
  alt="Stickiness insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

Use [stickiness](/docs/product-analytics/stickiness) insights to analyze how deeply users are engaging with your product, identify your most engaged users, and which features drive the most engagement.

### Lifecycle

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgLifecycleLight} 
  imageDark={ImgLifecycleDark} 
  alt="Lifecycle insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

[Lifecycle](/docs/user-guides/lifecycle) insights are helpful for checking your product's health by breaking users down by new, returning, resurrecting, and dormant.

### SQL (beta)

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgSQLLight} 
  imageDark={ImgSQLDark} 
  alt="SQL insight" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

Use [SQL](/docs/product-analytics/sql) insights to create custom tables based on your data using SQL.

## How to create an insight

To create a new insight, navigate to the [product analytics tab](https://us.posthog.com/insights) and click on `New insight`. You can also select the type of insight you'd like to create from the dropdown.

<ProductVideo
  videoLight={NewInsightLight} 
  videoDark={NewInsightDark} 
  classes="rounded"
/>

You can then customize the insight and save it. You can change the type of insight you're creating by clicking on the tabs at the top.

### Other ways to create new insights

1. By clicking the "+" symbol next to "Product analytics" in the sidebar.

2. By clicking "Add insight" in the top right of any [dashboard](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards). Insights you create this way are automatically added to the dashboard.

3. Inside any notebook. Insights created in a Notebook aren't saved to 'Your Insights' automatically â€“ see our Notebook docs for more.

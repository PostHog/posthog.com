The Toolbar is like the 'Inspect Element' dev tool, but specifically for PostHog features and data. When enabled, the Toolbar appears as an overlay **on your product or website** (it is not visible to your users). With it you can seamlessly interact with the elements to [create Actions](/tutorials/how-to-capture-events-the-easy-ways), visualize heatmaps, override feature flags, and more.

## How to launch the Toolbar

1. Go to 'Launch Toolbar' in the left-hand menu
2. Click 'Enable PostHog Toolbar'
3. Add the URLs you wish to enable the toolbar for. Only you will be able to see it â€“ not your users.
4. Click Save and then Launch.    
5. A new window will open with toolbar on your website. Click on the toolbar to interact with it.

## Heatmaps 

Heatmaps is a feature in the toolbar that shows you how users are interacting with elements on your website or app. 

> Note that to use the heatmaps feature, [autocapture](/docs/data/autocapture) must be enabled

To view your heatmaps, click on the toolbar and then click on the red fire (ðŸ”¥) icon.

![Launch Toolbar](../../images/tutorials/toolbar/toolbar-options.png)

With the heatmap on, clickable elements on your website will have a red overlay with numbers on them. Here's an example of our website with the heatmap enabled:

![An example from the PostHog website showing the heatmap highlighting a number of page elements. Some showing a count of clicks and one also showing a rage-click](../images/tutorials/toolbar/posthog-heatmap-example.png)

Each number in the top right box of each element represents the number of clicks it received. The number in the top left of the element is the number of rage-clicks.

You can change the date range of the heatmap by clicking on the number next to the (ðŸ”¥) icon on the toolbar. This displays a menu where you can select a new date range.

You can also load more data, change how links are matched, and view a list of the most clicked on elements in descending order.

### Loading more data

If you have many events, you may need to load more data to see everything on the heatmap. To do this, click on the load more button in the menu.

### Matching links within the page



## Toolbar features
  
-   **Inspect.** With the PostHog Toolbar, you are able to get the `class` and `id` of an element much faster and without any extra noise. Click the element to inspect and you'll have access to everything you need to know about that element.
-   **Heatmap.** Easily see the ranking of which parts of the page your users are interacting with the most.
-   **Actions.** Inspect an element, see how often it has triggered an event, and immediately create an [Action](/docs/user-guides/actions) with that data. With the Toolbar, everything you need to tailor your analytics is right in front of you: your website, the user data, and the functionality to create an Action.
-   **Feature flags.** See which feature flags are turned on for a particular page.

## Troubleshooting and FAQ
## Toolbar not loading or displaying?

When launched, the toolbar injects an API token in the format `#__posthog=JSON` in your site's URL, like this: `http://mysite.com/#__posthog=JSON`.

The toolbar won't load if you have a frontend that overrides the injected API token (the information after the #) before the `posthog-js` library (or snippet) loads and has a chance to read the API token.

To solve this, get the `__posthog` JSON from the URL before it is overridden and call `posthog.loadToolbar(JSON)`:

```js
const toolbarJSON = new URLSearchParams(window.location.hash.substring(1)).get('__posthog')
if (toolbarJSON) {
    posthog.loadToolbar(JSON.parse(toolbarJSON))
}
```

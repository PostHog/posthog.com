## Create groups

## Capture group events

<JSLinkEventsToGroups />

### Advanced (server-side only): Capture group events without a user

If you want to capture group events but don't want to associate them with a specific user, we recommend using a single static string as the distinct ID to capture these events. This can be anything you want, as long as it's the same for every group event:

<MultiLanguage >

```node
posthog.capture({
    event: 'group_event_name',
    distinctId: 'static_string_for_group_events',
    groups: { company: 'company_id_in_your_db' }
})
```

```python
posthog.capture('static_string_for_group_events', 
    'group_event_name', 
    groups={'company': 'company_id_in_your_db'}
)
```

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "static_string_for_group_events",
    Event: "group_event_name",
    Groups: posthog.NewGroups().
        Set("company", "company_id_in_your_db"),
})
```

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => 'static_string_for_group_events',
    'event' => 'group_event_name',
    '$groups' => array("company" => "company_id_in_your_db")
));
```

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "group_event_name",
    "distinct_id": "static_string_for_group_events",
    "properties": {
        "$groups": {"company": "company_id_in_your_db"}
    }
}' <ph_client_api_host>/i/v0/e/
```

</MultiLanguage >

## Using groups in PostHog

Now that we have created our first group type, we can take a look at how to use groups within PostHog.

### View groups and their properties

To view groups and their properties:

1. Go to the **People** tab on the navigation bar.
2. Select the **group type** you are interested in and view the groups and properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {viewGroupLight}
    imageDark = {viewGroupDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="View groups"
/>

### View group insights

You can use groups in [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) to view aggregated events based on group type.

For example, let's say that we wanted to see a graph showing how many different organizations have signed up recently:

1. Expand the menu next to the event you've chosen. This lists of all the group types 
available. 
2. Select the option for **Unique** with your group type name, such as 
"Unique organizations." This shows a graph with the total number of groups (organizations) that 
have signed up (as opposed to individual users).

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {groupInsightsLight}
    imageDark = {groupInsightsDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Analyze group insights"
/>

### Use groups with funnels

Another place where group analytics can be used is within funnels.

For example, you may want to understand how organizations move from their first visit to eventually signing up. You can do this by setting the "Aggregating by" field to "Unique organizations."

This shows how many organizations have made it through, as well as the percentage of organizations that dropped off. It's also possible to see exactly which specific groups dropped off at each step.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {funnelsGroupAggregationLight}
    imageDark = {funnelsGroupAggregationDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Group funnels"
/>

### Use groups with feature flags

To do this, [create a feature flag](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags.mdx) as you normally would, and select the group type you wish to "Match by", using the drop down in the "Release conditions" section:

<ProductVideo
    videoLight = {groupsInFeatureLight} 
    videoDark = {groupsInFeatureDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Feature flags for groups"
/>

You also need to update your event tracking code for the feature flag to determine the groups of the current user.

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
// Make sure you have called posthog.group() earlier in that session

if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature')) {
    // Do something
}
```

```python
if posthog.feature_enabled("new-groups-feature", "user_distinct_id", groups={"company": "company_id_in_your_db"}):
    # Do something
```

```php
if (PostHog::isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature', 'user_distinct_id', false, array("company" => "company_id_in_your_db"))) {
    // Do something
}
```

```node
const isFlagEnabled = await posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature', 'user_distinct_id', false, { company: 'company_id_in_your_db' })

if (isFlagEnabled) {
    // Toggle feature-flag specific behavior
}
```

</MultiLanguage>

### Rename group types

You can change how group types are displayed in the insights interface and throughout PostHog in **Settings** > **Customer analytics**.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/Screenshot_2025_11_18_at_5_05_01_PM_f6d855ed9e.png"
    imageDark = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/Screenshot_2025_11_18_at_5_05_28_PM_ad3b9f13b4.png"
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Groups in project settings"
/>

## Delete groups

To delete a group type:

1. Go to the **People** tab in the navigation bar.
2. Select **Menu options**, then **Delete group type**.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {deleteGroupsLight}
    imageDark = {deleteGroupsDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="View groups"
/>

<CalloutBox icon="IconWarning" title="Important notes about deleting groups" type="caution">

- When you delete a group, the underlying event data remains unchanged. The group data is filtered out from queries based on a deletion timestamp, which means deleted groups do not count toward your usage limits.
- Historical events associated with the deleted group are preserved in the database. If new events come in with the same group key, the group will reappear in the interface.
- The group key can be reused after deletion to create a new group, and any new events with that group key will cause it to show up again.
- Deleting a group is permanent and cannot be undone through the interface.

</CalloutBox>

## Limitations

-   A maximum of 5 group types can be created per project.
-   Multiple groups of the same type cannot assigned to a single event (e.g., Company A & Company B).
-   Groups are not currently supported for the following insights:
    -   Lifecycle - Expected soon.
    -   User paths - These only support user level analytics.
- Only groups with known properties are shown under [People](https://app.posthog.com/persons).

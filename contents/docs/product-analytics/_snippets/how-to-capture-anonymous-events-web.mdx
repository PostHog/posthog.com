PostHog captures anonymous events by default. However, this may change depending on your [`person_profiles` config](/docs/libraries/js#config) when initializing PostHog:

1. `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` _(recommended)_ _(default)_ - Anonymous events are captured by default. PostHog only captures identified events for users where [person profiles](/docs/data/persons) have already been created. 

2. `person_profiles: 'always'`  - Capture identified events for all events.

3. `person_profiles: 'never'` - Capture anonymous events for all events.

For example:
```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```

PostHog captures identified events by default. To change this and capture anonymous events, change the `person_profiles` [config](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/android#all-configuration-options) when initializing PostHog:

1. `personProfiles: 'PersonProfiles.ALWAYS'` _(default)_ - We capture identified events for all events.

2. `personProfiles: PersonProfiles.IDENTIFIED_ONLY` _(recommended)_ - Anonymous events are captured by default. We only capture identified events for users where [person profiles](/docs/data/persons) have already been created.

For example:

```kotlin
val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(
   apiKey = POSTHOG_API_KEY,
   host = POSTHOG_HOST,
   personProfiles = PersonProfiles.IDENTIFIED_ONLY
)
```

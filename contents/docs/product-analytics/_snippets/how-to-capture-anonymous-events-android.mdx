The Android SDK captures anonymous events by default. However, this may change depending on your `personProfiles` [config](/docs/libraries/android#all-configuration-options) when initializing PostHog:

1. `personProfiles = PersonProfiles.IDENTIFIED_ONLY` _(recommended)_ _(default)_ - Anonymous events are captured by default. PostHog only captures identified events for users where [person profiles](/docs/data/persons) have already been created.

2. `personProfiles = PersonProfiles.ALWAYS` - Capture identified events for all events.

3. `personProfiles = PersonProfiles.NEVER` - Capture anonymous events for all events.

For example:

```kotlin
val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(
   apiKey = POSTHOG_API_KEY,
   host = POSTHOG_HOST,
).apply {
   personProfiles = PersonProfiles.IDENTIFIED_ONLY
}
```

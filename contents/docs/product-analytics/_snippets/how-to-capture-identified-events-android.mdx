Identified events are captured by default if you've set the `personProfiles` [config](/docs/libraries/android#all-configuration-options) to `ALWAYS` (the default option).

If you've set the `personProfiles` to `IDENTIFIED_ONLY`, anonymous events are captured by default. Then, to capture identified events, call any of the following functions:

- [`identify()`](/docs/product-analytics/identify)
- [`alias()`](/docs/product-analytics/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user)
- [`group()`](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics)

When you call any of these functions, it creates a [person profile](/docs/data/persons) for the user. Once this profile is created, all subsequent events for this user will be captured as identified events.

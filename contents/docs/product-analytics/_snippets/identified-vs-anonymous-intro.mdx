PostHog captures two types of events: [**anonymous** and **identified**](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events)

**Identified events** enable you to attribute events to specific users, and attach [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties). They're best suited for logged-in users.

Scenarios where you want to capture identified events are:

- Tracking logged-in users in B2B and B2C SaaS apps
- Doing user segmented product analysis
- Growth and marketing teams wanting to analyze the _complete_ conversion lifecycle
   
**Anonymous events** are events without individually identifiable data. They're best suited for [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) or apps where users aren't logged in. 

Scenarios where you want to capture anonymous events are:

- Tracking a marketing website
- Content-focused sites
- B2C apps where users don't sign up or log in

Under the hood, the key difference between identified and anonymous events is that for identified events we create a [person profile](/docs/data/persons) for the user, whereas for anonymous events we do not.

 > **💡 Tip:** Under our current [pricing](/pricing), anonymous events can be up to 4x cheaper than identified ones (due to the cost of processing them), so it's recommended you only capture identified events when needed.

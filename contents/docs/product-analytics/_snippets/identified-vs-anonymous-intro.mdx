PostHog captures two types of events: **anonymous** and **identified**:

**Identified events** enable you to attribute events to specific users, and attach [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties). They're best suited for logged-in users.

Examples of scenarios where you want to capture identified events are:

- Tracking logged-in users in B2B and B2C SaaS apps
- Doing user segmented product analysis
- Growth and marketing teams wanting to analyze the _complete_ conversion lifecycle
   
**Anonymous events** are events without individually-identifiable data. They're best suited for [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) or mobile apps where users aren't logged in. 

Examples of scenarios where you want to capture anonymous events are:

- Tracking a marketing website
- Content-focused sites
- B2C apps where users don't sign up or log in

Under the hood, the key difference between identified and anonymous events is that for identified events we create a [person profile](https://posthog.com/docs/data/persons) for the user, whereas for anonymous events we do not.

 > **ğŸ’¡ Tip:** Under our current [pricing](/pricing), anonymous events can be up to 4x cheaper than identified ones (due to the cost of processing them), so it's recommended you only capture identified events when needed.

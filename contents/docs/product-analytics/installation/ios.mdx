PostHog is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) or as a Swift Package Manager dependency.

<IOSInstallationWrapper />

### Swift Package Manager

Add PostHog as a dependency in your Xcode project **Package Dependencies** and select the project target for your app.

For Swift Package Manager projects, add PostHog to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift file=Package.swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios.git", from: "3.0.0")
],
```

Then add it as a dependency for your target:

```swift file=Package.swift
.target(
    name: "myApp",
    dependencies: [.product(name: "PostHog", package: "posthog-ios")]),
```

### SwiftUI configuration

If you're using SwiftUI lifecycle, initialize PostHog in your app's `init()`:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import PostHog

@main
struct YourGreatApp: App {
    init() {
        let POSTHOG_API_KEY = "<ph_project_api_key>"
        let POSTHOG_HOST = "<ph_client_api_host>" // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'

        let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: POSTHOG_API_KEY, host: POSTHOG_HOST)
        PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

For more advanced options, see the [configuration page](/docs/libraries/ios/configuration).

import { ReactNativeInstallationWrapper } from './_snippets/react-native-installation-wrapper.tsx'

Our React Native library enables you to integrate PostHog with your React Native project. For Expo projects, there are no mobile native dependencies outside of supported Expo packages.

### React Native Web and macOS

If you're using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) or [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), don't use [expo-file-system](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system) since Web and macOS targets aren't supported. Use [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) instead.

### Without the PostHogProvider

If you prefer not to use the provider, initialize PostHog in its own file and import the instance:

```react-native file=posthog.ts
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

export const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  host: '<ph_client_api_host>' // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
})
```

Then access PostHog by importing your instance:

```react-native
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp() {
    useEffect(() => {
        posthog.capture('event_name')
    }, [])

    return <View>Your app code</View>
}
```

You can also use this instance with the PostHogProvider:

```react-native
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp() {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{/* Your app code */}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

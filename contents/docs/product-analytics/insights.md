-   [Funnels](/docs/user-guides/funnels)
-   [Retention](/docs/user-guides/retention)
-   [Paths](/docs/user-guides/paths)
-   [Stickiness](/docs/product-analytics/stickiness)
-   [Lifecycle](/docs/user-guides/lifecycle)
-   [SQL](/docs/product-analytics/hogql#sql-insights)

## How to create an insight

To create a new Insight, navigate to the [insights tab](https://app.posthog.com/insights) and click on `New insight`. Then select the type of insight you'd like to create, customize it, and press save.

You can then create [dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) to collect and present multiple insights in one place.

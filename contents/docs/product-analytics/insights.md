Insights enable you to visualize your Events and Actions. There are several different types of insights:

-   [Trends](/docs/user-guides/trends)
-   [Funnels](/docs/user-guides/funnels)
-   [Retention](/docs/user-guides/retention)
-   [Paths](/docs/user-guides/paths)
-   [Lifecycle](/docs/user-guides/lifecycle)

## How to create an insight

To create a new Insight, navigate to the [insights tab](https://app.posthog.com/insights) and click on `New insight`. Then select the type of insight you'd like to create, customize it, and press save.

You can then create [Dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) to collect and present multiple insights in one place.

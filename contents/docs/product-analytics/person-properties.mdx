Person properties enable you to capture, manage, and analyze specific data about a user. You can use them to create [filters](/docs/product-analytics/trends#filtering-events-based-on-properties) or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts), which can then be used in [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), [surveys](/docs/surveys), and more.

Person properties are stored on [person profiles](/docs/data/persons). When setting properties, a person profile is created if it doesn't already exist.

## How to set person properties

### How to remove person properties

Similarly to how you set properties, you can use `$unset` to remove properties from person profiles with any event and including an array of property keys:

<MultiLanguage selector="tabs">

```js-web
posthog.capture(
    'event_name', 
    { 
        $unset: ['email'],
    }
)
```

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        $unset: ['email'],
    },
})
```

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct_id',
    event='event_name',
    properties={
        '$unset': ['email'],
    }
)
```

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => 'distinct_id',
    'event' => 'event_name',
    'properties' => array(
        '$unset' => array(
           'email'
        )
    )
));
```

```ruby
posthog.capture({
    distinct_id: 'distinct_id',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        '$unset': ['email']
    }
})
```

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "distinct_id",
    Event:      "event_name",
    Properties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$unset": []string{"email"},
    },
})
```

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$unset", new String[]{"name"});
  }
});
```

</MultiLanguage>

## How to view and edit a person profile and properties

To view the person profile and properties for a particular person, go to [Persons & Groups](https://app.posthog.com/persons) in the PostHog app. Then, click on any person in the list to view their properties. 

On a person's property list, you can add properties to them by clicking the "New property" button, and then adding a key, type, and value. You can also delete a custom property for a user by clicking the red garbage bin icon on the right side of the property listing.

    videoLight = {viewUserPropertiesLight} 
    videoDark = {viewUserPropertiesDark}

## Person display name

The display name is the person property value shown in the PostHog UI to represent a user. It is their person `distinct_id` by default, but can be configured in [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#person-display-name).

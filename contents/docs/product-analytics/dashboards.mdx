Dashboards are the easiest way to track all your most important product and performance metrics.

Unlike [notebooks](/docs/notebooks), which are ideal of adhoc and one-off analysis, dashboards are designed for tracking common metrics over time. 

You can create a new dashboard from scratch, but we also offer numerous [pre-made dashboard templates](/templates) for tracking things like [common website metrics](/templates/website-dashboard), [product health metrics](/templates/health-dashboard), and important [metrics for large language models](/docs/ai-engineering/llm-insights).

## Creating a new dashboard

1. Click on 'Dashboards' in the left hand navigation and then 'New Dashboard'.
1. You can create a dashboard from a list of [available templates](/templates), or select 'Blank Dashboard' to start from scratch.
1. Name your dashboard, add some optional details if desired.
1. Your dashboard will be empty – click '+New insight' to create an insight to add.
1. There are several types of Insight you can now create - [Trends](/docs/user-guides/trends), [Funnels](/docs/user-guides/funnels), [Retention](/docs/user-guides/retention), [Paths](/docs/user-guides/paths), and [Lifecycle](/docs/user-guides/lifecycle)
1. Click 'Save & add to dashboard' when you've created your insight.

If you already have some insights set up, an alternative approach is to click 'Add to dashboard' in any insight. 

> **Important:** Insights can appear on multiple dashboards at the same time, so you don't have to create multiple copies of the same insight. Chnages to the insight will be reflected in all the dashboards it's used in.

## Dates and filters

### Date range overides

New dashboards are set to 'No date range overide' by default. This means all insights will use the date range applied in their configuration. 

Changing the date range on a dashboard forces all the insights to use the same date range, but this doesn't impact the date range that's shown when viewing an individual insights.

### Dashboard filters

Dashboards also support most of the same filters as individual insights, including:

- **Event properties:** Properties stored on event, such as the `Current URL` when the event was triggered.
- **Person properties:** Properties of individual users, such as `company_name`.
- **Feature flags:** Filtering for users with a specific feature flag enabled.
- **Group properties:** Account-level properties, like `organization_id`, which are only avilable if you have the [group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) add-on.
- **Cohorts:** Filtering by [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) of users you've already created.

Using filters on dashboards is a useful way to compare usage between different types of users without recreating insights over and over.

You can, for example, duplicate a dashboard – click on the '...' menu and click 'Duplicate' – and apply different filters to each version of the dashboard.

## Dashboard options

### Editing the layout

You can move and resize all the insights on a dashboard by entering the 'Edit layout' mode. 

You can do this in three ways:

- Tap 'E' on your keyboard
- Click on the '...' icon at the top of the dashboard and click 'Edit layout'
- Click on the '...' icon on any insight card and click 'Edit layout'

Tapping 'F' enabled fullscreen mode.

### Sharing a dashboard

By clicking 'Share' in the top right corner you can:

-   Restrict edit access to certain members within a project. Dashboards can be shared either by members with administrator privileges, or by the dashboard creator. ([Teams add-on](/pricing) required).

-   Create a link to share your dashboard publicly, or embed your dashboard on a website. Read more about this in our [sharing and embedding docs](/docs/product-analytics/sharing).

### Auto refresh

You can manually refresh a dashboard at any time, but you can also set it to automatically refresh.

To do so, click the dropdown arrow next to refresh button, turn on auto refresh and choose your refresh interval.

This is useful if you have a PostHog dashboard on a TV screen for others to see.

> Note: Auto refresh only works when the tab is active

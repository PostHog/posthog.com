Retention shows you how many users return during subsequent periods. It's useful for answering questions like:

- Are new sign ups coming back to use your product after trying it?
- Is a new feature or user experience getting people to return? 
- What type of user retains the best?

Retention insights are also a vital tool for evaluating whether you've [achieved product-market fit](/founders/product-market-fit-game).

## Creating a retention insight

Retention insights support both [events](/docs/data/events) and [actions](/docs/data/actions).

When you create a retention insight, you're defining two things:

1. A start event - an event or action that determines if the user or group should be included in the retention cohorts.
2. A return event - an event or action that the same user or group *returns* to perform. This tells us if they were *retained*.

It often, but not always, makes sense to use the same event or action for both.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/retention_product_interactions_light_5deef6c314.png"} 
    imageDark = {"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/retention_product_interactions_dark_d3c93467e9.png"}
    alt="Retention config" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

In the example above, we use an action called **Product Interactions** for both. We group by **Unique users** and chose users who did the **Product Interactions** action for the first time during a seven-week period.

You can also:

- Analyze retention for groups of users, such as all users in the same organization, company, or account. This is useful if your customers are companies with many users, but not all of them are active. This [requires group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics).

- Define the retention period by any number of hours, days, weeks, or months. To analyze retention across a whole year, for example, you should configure your insight to say "in the last 12 months".

- Configure [custom return time brackets](#custom-return-time-brackets) to measure retention at specific time intervals that align with your product's engagement patterns or business milestones, rather than using evenly-spaced periods.

- Use [24-hour time window mode](#24-hour-time-window-mode) to calculate retention using rolling 24-hour periods from each user's start event, rather than calendar-based periods. This ensures consistent measurement windows for all users regardless of when they sign up.

- Filter your retention insights using filter groups, such as event properties (country, device, etc.), person properties (job title, company name, etc.), feature flags (users who have a flag enabled), and existing [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) (pre-defined groups of users).

- Choose between **first time** and **recurring** retention. **Recurring retention** counts a user or group as part of a cohort if they performed the start event during that time period, irrespective of if it was their first time or not. **First time retention** only counts a user or group as part of the cohort if it was their first time performing the start event.

- Add [breakdowns](#breakdowns) to see how retention varies across different properties.

- Set up a bunch more [advanced calculation options](#retention-calculation-options) like relative retention.

## Understanding retention insights

Retention insights are visualized in two ways:

1. A **retention graph**, where each cohorts retention is rendered in a comparable line or bar graph.
2. A **cohort retention table**, where the same data is shown in a table.

By default, both show the percentage of users who retained in each cohort relative to 'Week 0'.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/retention_light_805120c74c.png"} 
    imageDark = {"https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/retention_dark_c319006162.png"}
    alt="Retention config" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

Here's a breakdown of the columns in the table:

- **Column A** denotes the cohort. This retention insight is grouped by week, so it shows the date range of the six most recent weeks, and the seventh currently incomplete week. 

- **Column B** shows the size of each individual cohort. As noted earlier, retention insights default to unique users, but they can also use groups.

- **Column C** is 'Week 0' - i.e. the week in which the start event or action first took place. This is always 100% because all users in that cohort must perform the event to be included. This would be 'Hour 0', 'Day 0', or 'Month 0' if you choose a different time period.

- **Column D** is Week 2 - i.e. the second week after the cohort was created. In this example, 27.4% of the 'May 20 to May 26' cohort retained, or 372 users.

### Tips for analyzing retention insights

- Users cannot exist in more than one cohort - i.e. a user in the 'May 20 to May 26' won't also appear in the 'Jun 3 to Jun 9' cohort.

- Users can appear in more than one retention period - i.e. they could be counted in both 'Week 1' and 'Week 3', or all six weeks. This means that it's possible for a later period to have higher retention than an earlier period. This could suggest that users tend to return in a regular pattern - i.e. every few days or weeks - to perform a specific task.

- Retention insights only show you whether users performed an action or event, not how often. For that, create a [stickiness insight](/docs/product-analytics/stickiness).

- Periods in progress are marked with a tooltip indicating they're not yet complete. These periods will update as more data comes in.

- Clicking on a retention cell opens a modal with details about the specific users retained in that period, allowing for deeper analysis.

## Retention calculation options

- Select between two **retention reference** options: "Period 0" (default) and "Previous period". The reference determines how percentages are calculated - either relative to the initial cohort or the previous period.

- Choose between **weighted mean** (default) and **simple mean** for retention calculation. Weighted mean accounts for different cohort sizes when calculating the average retention, while simple mean treats all cohorts equally.

### Relative retention

There are two options for calculating retention percentage over time:

1. **Starting cohort size (default)**. The percentage of users or groups who returned compared to the *initial cohort size*. For example, if Day 3 shows 25% for a cohort, it means that 25% of the users who performed the start event returned on Day 3.

2. **Previous period**. The percentage of users or groups who returned compared to the *previous period*. With this option if Day 3 shows 40%, it means that 40% of the number of users who returned on Day 2 returned on Day 3. The option helps to see which time interval has the biggest percentage increase/drop offs in users.

    alt="Retention reference toggle" 
    classes="rounded"

### Returning time criteria

There are two options for calculating who is included in the returning cohort:

1. **On (default)**. Only users who returned (performed 'return event') **on** the specific time interval are included. This is useful when you feature requires users to come back in each and every time interval.

2. **On or after**. Also known as cumulative, rolling or unbounded retention. When selected, the retention number for a specific time interval, say Day 2, includes user who returned **on or after** Day 2 (i.e. users who returned on Day 3, Day 4,... are also counted in Day 2). This is essentially the inverse of your overall churn rate. It shows how many people used your product and eventually returned to find more value. This is useful for evaluating features that don't require users to come back in every time period.

### Custom return time brackets

By default, retention insights show evenly-spaced time periods (e.g., Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4...). With custom return time brackets, you can define specific time intervals that align with your product's unique engagement patterns or business milestones.

**When to use custom brackets:**

- **Non-standard engagement cycles**: If your users engage with your product on irregular schedules that don't align with standard daily or weekly patterns. For example, a subscription service where users typically renew every 45 days can create a custom 45-day bracket to measure retention aligned with their subscription cycle.

- **Product lifecycle milestones**: When you want to measure retention at specific product milestones. For example, if your app has a 21-day free trial, you can create custom brackets for Day 1, Day 7, Day 21, and Day 30 to track retention at key trial stages and conversion points.

- **Event-specific analysis**: For products with seasonal or event-driven usage patterns. For example, an e-commerce platform running sales every 60 days can create custom brackets (Day 1, Day 30, Day 60, Day 90) to assess how many users return for each sale event.

- **Long-term retention focus**: When you're primarily interested in long-term retention rather than daily patterns. Instead of tracking Day 1 through Day 30, you might create custom brackets like Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90, Day 180 to focus on key retention milestones.

Custom brackets help you focus on the time periods that matter most for your business, making it easier to identify trends and make data-driven decisions about user engagement.

### 24-hour time window mode

By default, retention insights use calendar-based periods (e.g., Day 1 refers to the first calendar day after the start event, Day 2 refers to the second calendar day, etc.). With 24-hour time window mode, retention is calculated using rolling 24-hour periods from when each user first performed the start event.

**When to use 24-hour time windows:**

- **Precise timing requirements**: When you need exact 24-hour measurement periods regardless of when users sign up. For example, if a user signs up at 11 PM, calendar-based Day 1 only gives them 1 hour, while 24-hour mode ensures they get a full 24 hours to return.

- **Global products with timezone complexity**: For products with users across multiple time zones, calendar days can create inconsistent measurement windows. 24-hour windows provide uniform measurement regardless of a user's location or when they first engage.

- **Time-sensitive features**: When measuring retention for features where the exact time elapsed matters more than calendar alignment. For example, a messaging app might want to measure if users return within 24 hours of sending their first message, regardless of what time of day that occurred.

- **Consistent user experience windows**: When you want to ensure all users get the same amount of time to return, regardless of when they started. This is particularly useful for onboarding flows, trial periods, or time-limited features where fairness and consistency matter.

**Example**: With calendar-based periods, a user who signs up at 11:59 PM on Monday would have only 1 minute counted as "Day 1", while a user who signs up at 12:01 AM on Tuesday gets a full 24 hours. With 24-hour time windows, both users get exactly 24 hours from their signup time, providing more accurate and fair retention measurement.

### Mean calculation logic

You can choose between two different calculation options for the mean/average retention for each time interval.

1. **Simple**. Calculates the average retention rate across all cohorts by giving equal weight to each cohort, regardless of its size.

2. **Weighted**. Calculates the average retention rate by giving more weight to larger cohorts, accounting for different cohort sizes in the final mean.

## Breakdowns

You can break down your retention numbers and graph on event, person, group properties, and more. For example, breaking down the retention numbers by **Country Name** can help to see which countries have higher retention for the feature.

When using breakdowns, you see the mean retention for each breakdown value and can click on each row to expand and show each cohort with that breakdown value. There is also a dropdown selector which lets you filter the graph and table for a specific breakdown value.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Clean_Shot_2025_04_29_at_15_05_11_57dcd61f8c.png"

    alt="Retention breakdown" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

The breakdown logic is implemented such that **both** the start and return event must have the same breakdown value. For example, when breaking down by browser, if the user performs the start event in Google Chrome but performs the return event in Firefox, the return event won't be counted in the breakdown results for Google Chrome. 

## Displaying retention insights

When saving a retention insight, there are two things to consider:

1. Whether you want it to show as a line or bar chart. Choose this on the chart when creating an insight.
2. Whether you want it to show as a chart or a table (or both) on a dashboard. Choose this after saving the insight by clicking on **Options** and then set it to **Show table only**, **Show graph only**, or **Show both**.

### Selecting specific periods to plot

By default, retention charts display all available retention periods (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4...). You can select a specific period to display in the chart, which helps reduce visual clutter and focus on the periods that matter most for your analysis.

{/* TODO: for when we support selecting more than one column
**When to use period selection:**

- **Focusing on key milestones**: When you want to highlight specific retention periods that align with important business milestones. For example, if you're analyzing a 30-day trial, you might select only Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 to focus on early retention and conversion points.

- **Reducing visual complexity**: When you have many retention periods (e.g., 12+ weeks) and want to create a cleaner, more readable chart. Selecting a subset of periods makes it easier to identify trends without overwhelming the visualization.

- **Comparing specific periods**: When you want to compare retention at particular intervals. For example, selecting Week 1, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 allows you to compare retention at monthly intervals without the noise of weekly data points.

- **Analyzing long-term patterns**: When you're primarily interested in long-term retention trends. Instead of showing all 52 weeks, you might select Week 1, Week 4, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 to see retention evolution at key intervals.
*/}

To select specific periods, click on the retention table column you want to display. The chart will update to show only the selected period, making it easier to focus on the data that matters most for your analysis. 
Note that period selection is not available for shared insights or embedded retention charts.

##  Retention vs. Stickiness

[Stickiness](/docs/product-analytics/stickiness) and retention insights can look very similar, but they tell you different things:

-  **Retention** measures the percentage of users who came back and performed an event within a given period **at least once**
-  **Stickiness** measures **how many** times within a period a user performed an event

Retention is good for seeing how well you're doing at keeping users engaged overall. Stickiness is useful for seeing deeply users are engaging with your product and helps you identify the most engaged users.

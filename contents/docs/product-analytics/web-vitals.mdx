PostHog can automatically capture [core web vitals](https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals) like largest contentful paint, first input delay, cumulative layout shift, and first contentful paint. This you means you don't need to manually add web vitals logging.

## How to enable web vitals autocapture

Go to your [Autocapture & heatmaps settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-autocapture#web-vitals-autocapture). Then, in the **Web vitals autocapture** section, click **Enable**.

> **Note:** Web vitals autocapture is separate from our regular [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) feature. Web vitals can be captured regardless of whether autocapture is enabled.

Once enabled, web vitals are captured under the `$web_vitals` event name. These events include properties for each of the metrics like `$web_vitals_FCP_value` and `$web_vitals_FCP_event`. 

You can choose which metrics to capture by using the toggles.

## Dashboard template

Once you've enabled the integration, we've created a dashboard template to help you quickly set up relevant insights. 

To create your own dashboard from a template:

1. Go the [dashboard tab](https://us.posthog.com/dashboard) in PostHog.
2. Click the **New dashboard** button in the top right.
3. Select **Web vitals** from the list of templates.

## Events captured

The SDK groups available metrics in order to reduce the cost. That means each `$web_vitals` event carries one or more metric result. By default we wait up to 5 seconds in order to try and catch all four metrics in one event. See the section on configuring web vitals capture below for how to change this behaviour.

Metrics are made available when the [web vitals library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) triggers them. This is different for different metrics.

[FCP](https://web.dev/articles/fcp) and [LCP](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) are relative to a page being rendered and are made available relatively soon after loading a page. [INP](https://web.dev/articles/inp) and [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls) are measures across the lifecycle of a page and don't have a fixed time they become available.

We wait until all allowed metrics have been triggered or `web_vitals_delayed_flush_ms` has passed and then send a single `$web_vitals` event with each of the triggered metrics.


## Configuring web vitals autocapture

You can provide client side config to tune web vitals autocapture. These are set on [the `capture_performance` key of PosthogConfig](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/38744a512abef2f4eb7327e7a3c23d184c3993ca/src/types.ts#L209)

| attribute | description|
|-|-|
|`__web_vitals_max_value`<br/>default: 15 minutes| We observe very large values reported by the Chrome web vitals library. These outliers are likely not real, useful values, and we exclude them. You can set this to 0 in order to include all values |
|`web_vitals_allowed_metrics`<br/>default: ['LCP', 'CLS', 'FCP', 'INP' ]| By default all 4 metrics are captured. You can set this config to restrict which metrics are captured. e.g. ['CLS', 'FCP'] to only capture those two metrics. NB setting this does not override whether the capture is enabled |
|`web_vitals_delayed_flush_ms`<br/>default: 5000|we delay flushing web vitals metrics to reduce the number of events we send. This is the maximum time we will wait before sending the metrics. |

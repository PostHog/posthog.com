PostHog can automatically capture [core web vitals](https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals) like largest contentful paint, first input delay, cumulative layout shift, and first contentful paint. This you means you don't need to manually add web vitals logging.

## How to enable web vitals autocapture

Go to your [Autocapture & heatmaps settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-autocapture#web-vitals-autocapture). Then, in the **Web vitals autocapture** section, click **Enable**.

> **Note:** Web vitals autocapture is separate from our regular [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) feature. Web vitals can be captured regardless of whether autocapture is enabled.

Once enabled, web vitals are captured under the `$web_vitals` event name. These events include properties for each of the metrics like `$web_vitals_FCP_value` and `$web_vitals_FCP_event`. 

You can choose which metrics to capture by using the toggles.

## Dashboard template

Once you've enabled the integration, we've created a dashboard template to help you quickly set up relevant insights. 

To create your own dashboard from a template:

1. Go the [dashboard tab](https://us.posthog.com/dashboard) in PostHog.
2. Click the **New dashboard** button in the top right.
3. Select **Web vitals** from the list of templates.

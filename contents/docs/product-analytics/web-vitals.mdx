PostHog can automatically capture [core web vitals](https://web.dev/explore/learn-core-web-vitals) like largest contentful paint, first input delay, cumulative layout shift, and first contentful paint. This you means you don't need to manually add web vitals logging.

## How to enable web vitals autocapture

Go to your [Autocapture & heatmaps settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-autocapture#web-vitals-autocapture). Then, in the **Web vitals autocapture** section, click **Enable**.

> **Note:** Web vitals autocapture is separate from our regular [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) feature. Web vitals can be captured regardless of whether autocapture is enabled.

Once enabled, web vitals are captured under the `$web_vitals` event name. These events include properties for each of the metrics like `$web_vitals_FCP_value` and `$web_vitals_FCP_event`. 

You can choose which metrics to capture by using the toggles.

## Dashboard template

Once you've enabled the integration, we've created a dashboard template to help you quickly set up relevant insights. 

To create your own dashboard from a template:

1. Go the [dashboard tab](https://us.posthog.com/dashboard) in PostHog.
2. Click the **New dashboard** button in the top right.
3. Select **Web vitals** from the list of templates.

## Events captured

The SDK attempts to send as many of the available metrics as possible in each `$web_vitals` event. By default, we wait up to 5 seconds since the page load or last `$web_vitals` event to try and catch all four metrics in one event. See the section on [configuring web vitals](#configuring-web-vitals-autocapture) capture to change this behaviour.

Metrics are made available when the [web vitals library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) triggers them:

- [FCP](https://web.dev/articles/fcp) and [LCP](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) are relative to a page being rendered and are made available relatively soon after loading a page. 
- [INP](https://web.dev/articles/inp) and [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls) are measures across the lifecycle of a page and don't have a fixed time they become available.

## Configuring web vitals autocapture

You can provide a client side config to tune web vitals autocapture. These are set on [the `capture_performance` key](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/src/types.ts#L209).

| Attribute | Description |
|-|-|
|`__web_vitals_max_value`<br/>default: 15 minutes| We observe very large values reported by the Chrome web vitals library. These outliers are likely not real, useful values, and we exclude them. You can set this to 0 in order to include all values |
|`web_vitals_allowed_metrics`<br/>default: ['LCP', 'CLS', 'FCP', 'INP' ]| By default all 4 metrics are captured. You can set this config to restrict which metrics are captured. e.g. ['CLS', 'FCP'] to only capture those two metrics. This does not override whether the capture is enabled |
|`web_vitals_delayed_flush_ms`<br/>default: 5000|We delay flushing web vitals metrics to reduce the number of events we send. This is the maximum time we will wait before sending the metrics. |

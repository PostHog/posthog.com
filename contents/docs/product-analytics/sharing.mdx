You can share a public link to a specific insight or embed an insight in a web page or application (where the insight will be displayed in an iframe).

## Share an insight's public link

## Embed an insight

In the same panel as above, copy the HTML code to embed the insight on a webpage.

### Refreshing

If your insight needs to be refreshed frequently, add `?refresh=true` to the end of the insight ID in the iframe code. Example:

```
<iframe width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://us.posthog.com/embedded/123456?refresh=true"></iframe>
```

### API

You can also embed an insight using the [insights API](/docs/api/insights).

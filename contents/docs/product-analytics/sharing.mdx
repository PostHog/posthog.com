You can share a public link to a specific insight or embed an insight in a web page or application (where the insight will be displayed in an iframe).

## Share an insight's public link

1. Choose _Share or embed_ from the `...` (more options) menu located at the top right corner of the page.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {shareOrEmbedLight} 
    imageDark = {shareOrEmbedDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Sharing an insight via the PostHog app"
/>

1. Toggle ON the option to share the insight publicly.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {sharePubliclyLight} 
    imageDark = {sharePubliclyDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Share PostHog insight publicly"
/>


1. Click _Copy public link_ to copy the link to your clipboard. This insight won't require authentication to view.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {embedInsightLight} 
    imageDark = {embedInsightDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Sharing an insight via the PostHog app"
/>

## Embed an insight

In the same panel as above, copy the HTML code to embed the insight on a webpage.

### Refreshing

If your insight needs to be refreshed frequently, add `?refresh=true` to the end of the insight ID in the iframe code. Example:

```
<iframe width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://us.posthog.com/embedded/123456?refresh=true"></iframe>
```

### API

You can also embed an insight using the [insights API](/docs/api/insights).

## Autocapture

You should enable [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) so you can define events retroactively.

## Custom events

You might also want to send some custom events since it's sometimes easier than defining an event using the [Toolbar](/docs/product-os/toolbar) than with autocapture.

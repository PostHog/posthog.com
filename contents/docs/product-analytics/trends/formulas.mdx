Formulas are custom mathematical expressions that you can use to compare and combine the value of multiple series.

To add a formula, click **Enable formula mode**. Then, within the input box, type out the expression you would like to evaluate.

This expression can contain any number of basic mathematical operators (+, -, \*, /) along with variables (`A`, `B`, `C`, ...), which correspond to the series with that letter.

If you have two series A and B, then the formula `A / B` will plot the value of series A divided by the value of series B at each point in time.

You can add multiple formulas to your insight, each will be shown as a separate series.

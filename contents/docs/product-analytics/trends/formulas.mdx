Formulas are custom mathematical expressions that you can use to compare and combine the value of multiple series.

To add a formula, click 'Enable formula mode'. Then within the input box, type out the expression you would like to evaluate.

This expression can contain any number of basic mathematical operators (+, -, \*, /) along with variables (`A`, `B`, `C`, ...), which correspond to the series with that letter.

If you have two series A and B, then the formula `A / B` will plot the value of series A divided by the value of series B at each point in time.

When using a formula, only one series will be displayed on the chart, which will show the output of the formula at each point in time.

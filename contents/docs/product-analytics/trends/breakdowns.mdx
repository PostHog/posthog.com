You can use breakdowns to split up trends insights by the values of a specific property, such as by `Current URL`, `Country`, or `email`, or a [cohort of users](#break-down-by-cohort) – pretty much anything you can imagine, really.

To add a breakdown, click on '+ Add breakdown' in the group filters section and search for your desired property. The supported properties are: 

| Name                   | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event properties       | Properties specific to a tracked event (e.g. `Current URL`)                             |
| Session properties     | Properties specific to a single session (e.g. `Entry URL`)                              |
| Person properties      | Properties stored on a user's person profile (e.g. `company_name`)                      |
| Feature flag           | Events where a specific feature flag was enabled                                        |
| Group properties| Properties stored on a group (requires [group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics)) |
| Cohorts                | Events performed by a pre-defined list of users                                   |
| HogQL                  | Custom breakdown using SQL (see our [advanced breakdowns tutorial](/tutorials/hogql-breakdowns)) |

Once you've selected a property, you should see your graph split into multiple series, each one corresponding to a distinct value of that property.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {breakdownGraphLight} 
    imageDark = {breakdownGraphDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Graph of an insight broken down by a property"
/>

For readability, PostHog only loads the first 25 values of a breakdown when you first load an insight. You can manually load more values by clicking the 'Load more breakdown values' button.

To just see the total count, switch to a total value bar chart or table like the one below.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {breakdownBarsLight} 
    imageDark = {breakdownBarsDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Sample breakdown bar chart"
/>

Breakdowns only support a single property at a time, unless you use HogQL. To breakdown by the combination of browser and operating system, for example, you can use the following expression:

```
concat(properties.$browser, ' - ', properties.$os)
```

See our [HogQL expression docs](/docs/hogql/expressions) for more information.

## Cohorts and breakdowns

You can also break down trends insights by [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) – a specific list of users you've created that is either static, or updated automatically based on pre-defined properties.

Unlike properties, you can break down insights by _multiple_ cohorts at a time. This is useful if you want to compare how often different groups of users trigger a specific event, or complete an action.

When you create a breakdown using a cohort, an 'Add cohort' button will appear where you can add more cohorts to your breakdown.

## Breaking down numerical values into bins

When breaking down based on a string value, your graph will be split up with separate series for _every distinct value_ of that property. This works well for text values, but it's often too granular when trying to analyze numeric or time properties 

To solve this, when breaking down a numeric property, you can select a number of 'Bins' to combine ranges of values into.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {breakdownIntoBinsLight} 
    imageDark = {breakdownIntoBinsDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Breaking down into 10 bins"
/>

PostHog will then break up your events into the specified number of bins based on the distinct values of the property. For example, if your property can take the values `20, 21, 22, ..., 40` and you split it up into `10` bins, it will break your events up into ranges of `20 - 22`, `22 - 24`, etc. This aggregates all breakdown values, not just the top 25 ones, like it happens for non-numeric values.

To have more customization over bins or to bin any type of property, use [HogQL](/tutorials/hogql-breakdowns#bin-events).

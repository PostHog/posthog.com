There are numerous ways to aggregate events and properties in trends, so you can go beyond just tracking the total number of events.

Aggregations enable you to answer questions like:

- What is the average session duration of users on my site?
- How many unique users have used a feature within the last month?
- What is the 95th percentile in time spent loading?
- How often do users perform a specific event or action?
- How do power users and a non-power users behave?

## Event aggregation

Event aggregation determines how the number of events within a certain period are formatted and calculated. In this case, the aggregation is done based on how events are grouped, so if events are grouped by 'Day', then all events on a given day are aggregated based on the chosen method.

| Event aggregation          | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Total count                | The total number of times this event was performed in a given period.                                                                                                |
| Count per user             | The total number of times a per users performs this event, broken down by Average, Minimum, Maximum, Median, or 90th/99th/99th percentile.                            |
| Unique users               | The total number of unique users who have performed this event in a given period. _Example: If the same user performs an event twice, this will only count it as 1_. |
| Weekly active users (WAU)  | The total number of unique users who have performed this event within the last 7 days. This is a rolling count for each period, counting the previous 7 days.        |
| Monthly active users (MAU) | The total number of unique users who have performed this event within the last 30 days. This is a rolling count for each period, counting the previous 30 days.      |
| Unique sessions            | The total number of unique sessions within the given period where this event was performed.                                                                          |
| Unique groups              | The total number of unique groups that performed these events within a period. See our [group analytics docs](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) for more. |

## Property value aggregation

Property aggregation enables you to combine and plot the values of a property. Property aggregation only works on properties with numerical values.

| Property aggregation | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Average              | The average value of a property                                                                        |
| Sum                  | The sum of values of a property                                                                        |
| Minimum              | The minimum value of a property                                                                        |
| Maximum              | The maximum value of a property                                                                        |
| Median               | The median of the distribution of property values                                                      |
| 90th percentile      | The 90th percentile of the distribution of values (90% of events have a property value less than this) |
| 95th percentile      | The 95th percentile of the distribution of values (95% of events have a property value less than this) |
| 99th percentile      | The 99th percentile of the distribution of values (99% of events have a property value less than this) |

## HogQL expressions

You can also create your own aggregation using [HogQL](/docs/hogql/expressions). This enables you to use SQL operators and functions to customize how data is formatted and calculated. For an example, see our tutorial on [the power of HogQLâ€™s sum() aggregation](/tutorials/hogql-sum-aggregation).

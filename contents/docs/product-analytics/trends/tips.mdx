## Using the persons modal

Clicking on a data point in a trends insight opens the persons modal, which shows you a list of users/organizations that performed that event during the selected time period.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {personsLight} 
    imageDark = {personsDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="All persons who performed an event"
/>

From this menu, you can:
- Watch specific session replays where the user performed the selected event
- Dive deep into the properties of each individual user
- Save the entire list of users as a cohort
- Export the list of users to a CSV for further analysis

## Creating insights in notebooks

WORDS TO GO HERE

## Add units / custom prefixes and postfixes

You can change the unit of any trends insights, or add custom prefixes/postfixes - e.g. with a prefix of `$`, 123.45 will be displayed as "$123.45".

Units include duration (seconds or miliseconds) and pertentage.

[SCREENSHOT HERE]

To do so, click on 'Options' dropdown next to the chart type and select you want.

Also under the 'Options' dropdown is the ability to enable values on trends, and the legend, like in the screenshot above.

## View source (Beta)

Insight filters follow a declarative format that you can view and edit. Open the insight editor by clicking on the `{}` icon next to the save insight button and you will see the source for the current insight configuration. Using this editor you can copy-and-paste complete or partial insights and understand what is going on under the hood. We admit this is a bit of a power user feature, but if you're so inclined you might even find it easier to edit insights this way.

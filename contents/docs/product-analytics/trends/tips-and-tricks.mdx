## Viewing individual users and cohorts

Clicking on a data point in a trends insight opens the person modal, which shows you a list of users/organizations that performed that event during the selected time period.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {personsLight} 
    imageDark = {personsDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="All persons who performed an event"
/>

From this menu, you can:
- Watch specific session replays where the user performed the selected event
- Dive deep into the properties of each individual user
- Save the entire list of users as a cohort
- Export the list of users to a CSV for further analysis

## View source (Beta)

Insight filters follow a declarative format that you can view and edit. Open the insight editor by clicking on the `{}` icon next to the save insight button and you will see the source for the current insight configuration. Using this editor you can copy-and-paste complete or partial insights and understand what is going on under the hood. We admit this is a bit of a power user feature, but if you're so inclined you might even find it easier to edit insights this way.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {insightsSourceLight} 
    imageDark = {insightsSourceDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="View insight configuration source"
/>

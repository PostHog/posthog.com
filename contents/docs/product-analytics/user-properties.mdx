User properties enable you to capture, manage, and analyze specific data about a user. You can use them to create [filters](/docs/product-analytics/trends#filtering-events-based-on-properties) or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts), which can then be used in [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), and more. 

## How to set user properties

### What is the difference between `set` and `set_once`?

### How to remove user properties

Similarly to how you set properties, you can use `$unset` to remove properties with any event and including an array of properties keys:

<MultiLanguage selector="tabs">

```js-web
posthog.capture(
    'event_name', 
    { 
        $unset: ['email'],
    }
)
```

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        $unset: ['email'],
    },
})
```

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct_id',
    event='event_name',
    properties={
        '$unset': ['email'],
    }
)
```

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => 'distinct_id',
    'event' => 'event_name',
    'properties' => array(
        '$unset' => array(
           'email'
        )
    )
));
```

```ruby
posthog.capture({
    distinct_id: 'distinct_id',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        '$unset': ['email']
    }
})
```

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "distinct_id",
    Event:      "event_name",
    Properties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$unset": []string{"email"},
    },
})
```

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$unset", new String[]{"name"});
  }
});
```

</MultiLanguage>

## How to view user properties

To view properties for a particular user, go to [Persons & Groups](https://app.posthog.com/persons) in the PostHog app. Then, click on any person in the list to view their properties. 

On a user's property list, you can add properties to them by clicking the "New property" button, then adding a key, type, and value. You can also delete a custom property for a user by clicking the red garbage bin icon on the right side of property listing.

<ProductVideo
    videoLight = {viewUserPropertiesLight} 
    videoDark = {viewUserPropertiesDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="How to view user properties"
/>

## Person display name

The person display name is the name that is shown in the PostHog UI. The person properties that are used as the display name can be configured in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = {changeDisplayNameLight} 
    imageDark = {changeDisplayNameDark}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Where to change the display name in project settings"
/>

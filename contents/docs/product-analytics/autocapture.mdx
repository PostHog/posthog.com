PostHog can automatically capture events as users interact with your app. This means you don't need to manually add tracking for individual components, links, buttons, divs, spans, or other parts of your product. Autocapture also provides data for [heatmaps](/docs/toolbar/heatmaps).

Autocapture is available in the following SDKs:  

- [JavaScript Web](/docs/libraries/js) - enabled by default
- [React](/docs/libraries/react) - enabled by default
- [React Native](/docs/libraries/react-native) - disabled by default
- [iOS](/docs/libraries/ios) - disabled by default

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Looking for session and exception autocapture?" type="fyi">

  You can also autocapture session and exception events. See [session replay](/docs/session-replay/installation) and [error tracking](/docs/error-tracking/start-here) for more information.

</CalloutBox>

## Events captured by autocapture

PostHog automatically captures the following events when autocapture is enabled:

import Tab from "components/Tab"

<Tab.Group tabs={['Web', 'iOS', 'React Native']}>
<Tab.List>
<Tab>Web</Tab>
<Tab>iOS</Tab>
<Tab>React Native</Tab>
</Tab.List>
<Tab.Panels>
<Tab.Panel>

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `$autocapture` | On interactions with: `a`, `button`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `label`, and elements with `contenteditable="true"`. Autocaptures are [displayed](https://app.posthog.com/activity/explore) with names like `clicked span with text "Delete"`, but filtering for **Autocapture** will show you all autocaptured events. |
| `$pageview` | When the user navigates to a new page. |
| `$pageleave` | When the user navigates away from a page. |
| `$rageclick` | A second click within 1000ms within 30px of the first click. |
| `$copy_autocapture` | Clipboard events. Disabled by default. See [clipboard autocapture](#clipboard-autocapture). |

Autocaptured events (and client-side custom events) have many default properties. These are distinguished by `$` prefix in their name, the PostHog logo next to them in the activity tab, and the verified event logo. You can find them in [PostHog](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/properties) or in [the references](https://posthog.com/docs/references/posthog-js/types/Properties).

## Configuring autocapture

> This covers configuring autocapture in the JavaScript and React SDKs. For the React Native SDK, see our [React Native docs](/docs/libraries/react-native#autocapture).

### Capturing pageviews in single-page apps

Because PostHog hooks to the `navigator` API, we'll automatically capture pageviews and pageleaves. Make sure you've set `defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>'` in your `posthog.init` call to opt-in to this behavior.

```js-web
posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", {
  api_host: "<ph_client_api_host>",
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
})
```

### Reducing events with an allow and ignorelist

Autocapture enables you to start capturing events on your site quickly, but this can lead to large numbers of events. To counteract this, you can configure autocapture using `allowlists` and `ignorelists` (NB some options use allow behavior and some use ignore behavior. 

These are an array of events, URLs, elements, and CSS selectors that you want autocapture to allow or ignore.

For example, to only capture clicks on buttons on the docs section of the website that contain the data attribute `ph-autocapture` and don't contain the data attribute `data-attr-pii="email"`, you can do the following:

import AutocaptureConfig from './_snippets/multilanguage/autocapture-config.mdx'

<AutocaptureConfig />

Allow and ignorelists only filter autocapture events. They don't affect the data collected by session recordings or custom events.

> **Note:** When using `element_allowlist` or `css_selector_allowlist`, PostHog considers the entire tree of elements from the root to the target element of the click event, not just the element that was directly clicked. If *any* element or selector is in the tree *and* allow list, the click is captured.

### Preventing sensitive data capture

For security reasons and to prevent sensitive data capture, PostHog is conservative about capturing `input` tags. We specifically only collect the `name`, `id`, and `class` attributes from `input` tags. If you need to collect more data from inputs, you should use [custom events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events).

If there are specific elements you _don't_ want to capture, add the `ph-no-capture` class name.

```html
<button class='ph-no-capture'>Sensitive information here</button>
```

## Disabling autocapture

You can disable autocapture in your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/settings) or by setting `autocapture: false` in the [config](/docs/libraries/js/config). If _one_ of these is disabled, autocapture is disabled.

> **Note:** Disabling autocapture in your project settings isn't instant. PostHog will continue to capture events where it is initialized. Instead, autocaptured events will taper off as users trigger reinitialization of PostHog (like when they reload your site). 
>
> Disabling autocapture does not disable capture of page views or page leaves.

You can disable pageviews and pageleaves by setting `capture_pageview: false`. To just disable pageleaves, keep `capture_pageview: true` and set `capture_pageleave: false`.

Disabling autocapture **does not disable [session recording](/docs/session-replay/manual)**. You can disable session recording by turning it off in your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) or using `disable_session_recording: true` in the config.

You can update any of these config options at runtime (e.g. to update an allowlist or disable autocapture) using the `posthog.set_config()` method like this:

```js-web
posthog.set_config({ capture_pageview: false })
```

## Capturing additional properties in autocapture events

If you add a data attribute onto an element in the format `data-ph-capture-attribute-some-key={someValue}`, then any autocapture event from that element or one of its children will have the property `some-key: 'someValue'` added to it. This can be useful when you want to add additional information to autocapture events. 

### Get the value of an element

As an example, say you have a notification bell with a value like this:

![a notification bell showing 1 unread notification](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/data/autocapture/notification-bell.png)

You can include the unread count in the autocapture event by adding the `data-ph-capture-attribute` class like this:

```HTML
<div
    onClick={toggleNotificationsPopover}
    data-ph-capture-attribute-unread-notifications-count={unreadCount}
>
```

The autocapture event for clicks on the bell will include the unread count as an `unread-notifications-count` property.

### Tracking metadata

You can also attach metadata to autocapture events by adding data attributes to the element that triggers the event. This helps you track something like a customer performing a transaction (adding an item to a cart or completing a purchase).

The below ecommerce example helps you understand _what_ users are interested in, even if they don't complete a transaction. It can also reveal which products users are interested in when correlated with information like marketing campaigns, regionality, or device type.

```HTML
<button
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-id={productId}
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-name={productName}
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-price={productPrice}
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-quantity={productQuantity}
>
    Add to cart
</button>
```
Replace the `{productXx}` values with the relevant information available on the webpage. Now when the _Add to cart_ button is clicked, the autocapture event will include the product information in the event's properties, like:

```json
properties: {
    "product-id": "12345678",
    "product-name": "Red t-shirt",
    "product-price": "30",
    "product-quantity": "1"
}
```

## Sending custom properties with autocaptured form submissions

To prevent accidental sensitive data capture, we do not automatically capture form values from form submissions. To add custom properties to form submissions, you can use the `data-ph-capture-attribute` attribute on the form element.

In this example, the `product-id` property will be sent with the form submission event. The `product-name` input will not be captured.

```HTML
<form
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-id="12345678"
>
    <input name="product-name" placeholder="this input will not be autocaptured"/>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

The following example shows how you can use the `data-ph-capture-attribute` attribute dynamically in a React component. The `product-name` property will be sent with the form submission event.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

const MyForm = () => {
  const [productName, setProductName] = useState('')
  return (
    <form
        data-ph-capture-attribute-name={productName}
    >
        <input name="product-name" onChange={(e) => setProductName(e.target.value)} value={productName}/>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Analyzing autocaptured events and properties

Autocapture events and properties can be used like any other [event type](/docs/data/events). You can use them in trends, funnels, cohorts, surveys, and more. Beyond this, they come with some special features:

- When using the autocapture event series, you can filter by the autocaptured element's tag name, text, `href` target, and/or CSS selector.

<ProductScreenshot

  imageDark="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/auto_dark_c52206511f.png"
  alt="Trends using autocapture properties" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

- Autocapture events can be organized and renamed using [actions](/docs/data/actions).

- You can query autocapture `elements_chain` using [SQL](/tutorials/hogql-autocapture).


## Clipboard autocapture

You can configure `posthog-js` to autocapture information that users copy or cut on your page with the `capture_copied_text` config option.

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
    autocapture: {
        capture_copied_text: true,
        // any other autocapture config
    },
})
```

We then report the copied or cut text as a "Clipboard autocapture" event. You can use the `$selected_content` property in analysis or use the [activity page](/docs/activity) to view the copied content in context.

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={ImgClipboardAuocaptureLight} 
  imageDark={ImgClipboardAuocaptureDark} 
  alt="The activity view showing the copied content highlighted in context" 
  classes="rounded"
/>

Clipboard autocapture respects other privacy settings. For example, won't capture content from a password field.

> **Note:** Browsers don't directly allow access to copied data for privacy reasons so when `posthog-js` sees a clipboard event, we capture any text currently selected in the browser.import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

## Dead clicks autocapture

A dead click (or slow click) is a click which isn't followed by a change to the page. 

Dead clicks are a great way to identify opportunities to improve your UI, showing you where your users expect to be able to interact with the page but cannot.

You can collect dead clicks with the Web SDK by enabling them in PostHog settings. 

Or by setting your config:

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
    capture_dead_clicks: true,
    // any other config
})
```

> **Note:** The PostHog heatmap captures dead clicks for free, collecting only the coordinates of dead clicks to display in heatmaps. Enabling the autocapture of dead clicks here allows for deeper analysis and is priced as a standard product analytics event.

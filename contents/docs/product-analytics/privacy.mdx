PostHog offers a range of controls to limit what data is captured by product analytics. They are listed below in order of least to most restrictive.

## EU-cloud hosting

PostHog offers hosting on EU cloud. To use this, sign up at [eu.posthog.com](https://eu.posthog.com).

If you've already created a US cloud instance and wish to migrate ticket, you must raise a [support ticket in-app](https://us.posthog.com/home#supportModal) with the **Data pipelines** topic for the PostHog team to do this migration for you. This option is **only available to customers on the team or enterprise plan** as it requires significant engineering time.  

## Disable sensitive information with autocapture

If you're using [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), PostHog automatically attempts to prevent sensitive data capture. We specifically only collect the `name`, `id`, and `class` attributes from input tags.

If there are specific elements you don't want to capture, add the [`ph-no-capture`](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#preventing-sensitive-data-capture) class name.

```html
<button class='ph-no-capture'>Sensitive information here</button>
```

## Sanitize properties on the client

You can sanitize properties on the client side by setting the `before_send` [config](/docs/libraries/js#config) option. This is a function that enables you to modify the properties before they are sent to PostHog. You can even reject events by returning `null`. For example:

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    before_send: function(event) {
        if (event.properties['$ip']) {
            event.properties['$ip'] = null;
        }

        return event;
    }
});
```

## Use the property filter app

You can use the [property filter app](/docs/cdp/property-filter) to prevent PostHog from certain properties on events. For example, you can configure the app to remove all GeoIP data from events.

We've also put together a [tutorial](/tutorials/property-filter) to help you get started with the app.

## Cookieless tracking

It's possible to use PostHog without cookies. Instead, PostHog can use in-memory storage. For more details on how to do this, read our tutorial on [how to set up cookieless tracking](/tutorials/cookieless-tracking).

## Complete opt-out

You can completely opt-out users from data capture. To do this, there are two options:

1. Opt users out by default in your PostHog initialization config.

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    opt_out_capturing_by_default: true,
});
```

```ios_swift        
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: <ph_project_api_key>, host: <ph_client_api_host>)
config.optOut = true
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
```

```android
val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(
    apiKey = <ph_project_api_key>,
    host = <ph_client_api_host> 
)
config.optOut = true
PostHogAndroid.setup(this, config)
```

```react-native
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    opt_out_capturing_by_default: true,
});
```

</MultiLanguage>

2. Opt users out on a per-person basis.

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
posthog.opt_out_capturing()
```

```ios_swift        
PostHogSDK.shared.optOut()
```

```android
PostHog.optOut()
```

```react-native
posthog.opt_out_capturing()
```

</MultiLanguage>

Similarly, you can opt users in:

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
posthog.opt_in_capturing()
```

```ios_swift        
PostHogSDK.shared.optIn()
```

```android
PostHog.optIn()
```

```react-native
posthog.opt_in_capturing()
```

</MultiLanguage>

To check if a user is opted out:

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
posthog.has_opted_out_capturing()
```

```ios_swift        
PostHogSDK.shared.isOptOut()
```

```android
PostHog.isOptOut()
```

```react-native
posthog.has_opted_out_capturing()
```

</MultiLanguage>

PostHog offers a range of controls to limit what data is captured by product analytics. They are listed below in order of least to most restrictive.

## EU-cloud hosting

PostHog offers hosting on EU cloud. To use this, sign up at [eu.posthog.com](https://eu.posthog.com).

If you've already created a US cloud instance and wish to migrate ticket, you must raise a [support ticket in-app](https://us.posthog.com/home#supportModal) with the **Data pipelines** topic for the PostHog team to do this migration for you. This option is **only available to customers on the boost, scale or enterprise** as it requires significant engineering time.  

## Disable sensitive information with autocapture

If you're using [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), PostHog automatically attempts to prevent sensitive data capture. We specifically only collect the `name`, `id`, and `class` attributes from input tags.

If there are specific elements you don't want to capture, add the [`ph-no-capture`](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#preventing-sensitive-data-capture) class name.

```html
<button class='ph-no-capture'>Sensitive information here</button>
```

## Sanitize properties on the client

You can sanitize properties on the client side by setting the `before_send` [config](/docs/libraries/js/config) option. This is a function that enables you to modify the properties before they are sent to PostHog. You can even reject events by returning `null`. For example:

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
    before_send: function(event) {
        if (event.properties['$current_url']) {
            event.properties['$current_url'] = null;
        }

        return event;
    }
});
```

## Use the property filter app

You can use the [property filter app](/docs/cdp/property-filter) to prevent PostHog from certain properties on events. For example, you can configure the app to remove all GeoIP data from events.

We've also put together a [tutorial](/tutorials/property-filter) to help you get started with the app.

## Cookieless tracking

It's possible to use PostHog without cookies. Instead, PostHog can use in-memory storage. For more details on how to do this, read our tutorial on [how to set up cookieless tracking](/tutorials/cookieless-tracking).

## Complete opt-out

You can completely opt-out users from data capture. To do this, there are two options:

1. Opt users out by default in your PostHog initialization config.

import OptOutDefault from './_snippets/multilanguage/opt-out-default.mdx'

<OptOutDefault />

2. Opt users out on a per-person basis.

import OptOutPerPerson from './_snippets/multilanguage/opt-out-per-person.mdx'

<OptOutPerPerson />

Similarly, you can opt users in:

import OptIn from './_snippets/multilanguage/opt-in.mdx'

<OptIn />

To check if a user is opted out:

import CheckOptOut from './_snippets/multilanguage/check-opt-out.mdx'

<CheckOptOut />

## FAQs

### How much does LLM analytics cost?

Your first 100,000 `$ai_model` events each month are free â€“ i.e. if you never exceed this number, you can use LLM observability for free.

After this, we charge a small amount for each `$ai_*` event you send.

Go to the [pricing page](/pricing) to use our calculator to get an estimate. You can also view an estimate on [your billing page](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing).

## Troubleshooting

### Why can't I see any of my LLM events?

There are a few reasons why you might not be seeing any LLM events:

- There might be a delay in the events being processed. You can check the status of our injestion [here](https://status.posthog.com/).
- If you are in a serverless enviroment make sure you are calling `posthog.shutdown()` before ending the request.

  LLM observability gives you x-ray vision into your LLM applications. You can track:

  - 🗣️ Every conversation (inputs, outputs, and tokens)
  - 🤖 Model performance (cost, latency and error rates)
  - 🔍 Full traces for when you need to go detective mode
  - 💰 How much each chat/user/organization is costing you


  The first step is to install a PostHog SDK to capture conversations, requests, and responses from an LLM provider.

  ### Platforms

  <LLMsInstallationPlatforms />

  ### Beta 🚧

  LLM observability is currently considered in `beta`. To access it, enable the [feature preview](https://app.posthog.com/settings/user-feature-previews#llm-observability) in your PostHog account.
  
  We are keen to gather as much feedback as possible so if you try this out please let us know. You can email [peter@posthog.com](mailto:peter@posthog.com) and [radu@posthog.com](mailto:radu@posthog.com), send feedback via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Aexperiments%3Alow), or use one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

  Once you've installed the SDK, every LLM call automatically becomes a **generation** – a detailed record of what went in and what came out. Each generation captures:

  - 📝 Complete conversation context (inputs and outputs)
  - 🔢 Token counts and usage metrics  
  - ⏱️ Response latency and performance data
  - 💸 Automatic cost calculation based on model pricing
  - 🔗 Trace IDs to group related LLM calls together


  PostHog's SDK wrappers handle all the heavy lifting – just use your LLM provider as normal and we'll capture everything automatically. You can also add custom properties like user IDs, conversation IDs, or feature flags to understand usage patterns.

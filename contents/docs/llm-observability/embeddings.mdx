Embeddings are calls to embedding models that convert text into vector representations for semantic search, RAG pipelines, and similarity matching.

While [generations](/docs/llm-observability/generations) track LLM conversations and [spans](/docs/llm-observability/spans) track operations, embeddings specifically monitor vector generation:

- **Search queries** - Converting user input for semantic search
- **Document indexing** - Embedding content for retrieval
- **RAG pipelines** - Query and document vectorization
- **Batch processing** - Multiple embeddings in one call

For technical implementation details, see [manual capture](/docs/llm-observability/manual-capture).

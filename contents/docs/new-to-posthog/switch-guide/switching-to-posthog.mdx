PostHog is an easy sell for new projects and companies: one login and one simple integration gets you everything you need to build great products.

But if you're already leaning on another tool, switching can require some planning and diplomacy. A little finesse. 

Our switching guide exists to support your journey. Start here and learn to pitch PostHog to your teammates. With your team on board, we'll walk through [how to plan your pilot deployment](/docs/new-to-posthog/switch-guide/planning-your-pilot), and then how to [nail your migration](/docs/new-to-posthog/switch-guide/migration-planning).

## Why everyone will love PostHog

PostHog is one login and one bill.

This means less headache for more power, with all your data available across a range of products that help you understand user behavior as it happens.

You'll get a responsive team that cares about user needs, delivering on customer feedback constantly.

PostHog is completely agnostic to the language, framework, and stack you build your product with. You can adopt it incrementally, adding new functionality as needed.

Best of all, PostHog is built so that you’ll actually enjoy using it. We really want you to have a good time.

## Why product teams love PostHog

PostHog gives product teams the power to understand users, improve adoption, and test assumptions. Once PostHog is in place, your product teammates can dive in immediately, with loads of power that doesn't require further engineering intervention.

**Visualize anything** with [charts and trend reporting](docs/product-analytics/insights), and [dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) that are easy to build, but also deeply customizable for SQL enthusiasts.

**Learn anything you want** about everything the user touches in the product without manual instrumentation with [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture).

**Get clarity about navigation** and user priorities with [heatmaps](/docs/toolbar/heatmaps).

**Use session replay to reveal bugs**, expose friction, and help instantly answer questions like “is this new design working?” We support both [web and mobile SDKS](/docs/session-replay/installation).

**Integrate revenue data** from [Stripe](/docs/cdp/sources/stripe) and other sources using data warehouse, so you can get a clear picture of what changes really move the needle.

**Send events and other details to any other tool**, powering automations and keeping data in sync, with setup you can accomplish in seconds, fully customizable for any API or webhook. [Data pipelines](/docs/cdp) makes it easy.

**Gather feedback and book user interviews** from exactly the users you want to reach with no-code [surveys](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys) that deploy instantly.

**Get unblocked by PostHog’s helpful sales and support teams**, ensuring you get the insights and information you need quickly.

## Why engineers love PostHog

PostHog is designed for developers.

The project is [developed in the open](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), with a [public roadmap](/roadmap) and [dozens of pull requests landing](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) each week. While other products are low-velocity black boxes, we’re constantly making PostHog better.

 We’ve got a dedicated technical staff standing by to help keep you on track. If you ever do need support, you’ll be talking to someone who knows the technical details of the product really well.

Giving other teams the data they want becomes much easier with PostHog in the mix, lowering the burden on engineering. Once a basic integration is in place, there are loads of features everyone can use without a developer's intervention.

**Consolidate the tools your company needs**, with one login, one integration, one bill.

**Comprehensive documentation** developers love for every stack, framework, and language. You can also view [our source code directly](http://github.com/postHog/) if you can't find what you need. 

**Get a data platform that encourages tinkering**: if something doesn’t fit quite right for your team, it’s easy to customize everything. We'll host all these customizations for you. You don't need to worry about infrastructure or uptime.

**Integrating PostHog with other tools or even your own services is easy**, thanks to [data pipelines](/docs/cdp).

**Roll features out gradually** using [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags) that are easy to target with fine-grained queries across everything PostHog knows about your users.

We also care about the technical details of switching over. 

No matter your stack or existing tools, **complete integration and [migration docs](/docs/migrate)** mean a clear path instead of a puzzle to solve. Our experienced Sales and CS team can even provide backup for more complex cases.

## Why executives love PostHog

We’re in this for a long-term relationship, so **PostHog wants you to spend as little money as possible**. 

Our sales team actually works with customers to reduce bills and optimize consumption. Instead of sneaky billing, we’d prefer to make more money as a result of you winning more business.

There’s just no sneaky stuff going on here. You can get started immediately with no shenanigans, no calls with the sales team if you don't want them.

**Your team will like PostHog**. It’s fresh, always getting fixes, improvements, and additional power. An investment in PostHog today means even more capabilities by next year.

**There's no per-seat charge**, so PostHog makes it easy for everyone on your team to make data-driven decisions. No matter how quickly you scale your team, your costs remain fixed to the actual usage of your product. 

**PostHog’s sales process is transparent and so is the whole company**: the company [handbook is public](/handbook), *even documenting the ways we can offer [discounts](/handbook/growth/sales/billing#coupons-and-discounts)*. Everything you want to know about pricing, processes, and our product is publicly documented.

**You can have a free trial** to fully vet the costs and impact of your integration. Trying PostHog is low-risk, no cost, and fully reversible.

**PostHog doesn’t require a contract**. You can save money with one, but it’s not a blocker to trying things out.

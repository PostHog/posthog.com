For new projects and companies, PostHog is an easy sell: one login and simple integration gets you everything you need to build great products.

But convincing your teammates to switch horses later in a product's life can require some planning and diplomacy. We made you a cheatsheet to help make the case.

## Sharing social proof

We’ve published [customer stories](/customers) with loads of companies who have loved their switch to PostHog. If you want to share a bit of social proof, these are a great place to start. Here are some choice quotes.

## Advantages for everyone

PostHog is one login and one bill.

That means less headache for more power, with all your data available across a range of products that help you understand user behavior as it happens.

You'll get a responsive team that cares about user needs, delivering improvements and customer requests constantly.

PostHog is completely agnostic to the language, framework and stack you build your product with. You can adopt it incrementally, adding more as needed.

Best of all, PostHog is modern, fast, and built so that you’ll actually enjoy using it.

## Persuading product teams

PostHog gives product teams the power to understand users, improve adoption and test assumptions. Your product teammates can get dive in immediately without having to wait for engineers to write new code or hook up an integration.

**[Report anything](/docs/product-analytics/insights)** with charts, trend reporting and [dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) that are easy to build, but also deeply customizable for SQL enthusiasts.

**Learn anything you want** about everything the user touches in the product with [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture).

**Get clarity about navigation** and user priorities with [heatmaps](/docs/toolbar/heatmaps).

Use [session replay](/docs/session-replay/installation) to **reveal bugs, expose friction, and help instantly answer questions** like “is this new design working?”

**Send events and other details to any other tool**, powering automations and keeping data in sync, with setup you can accomplish in seconds, fully customizable for any API or webhook. [Data pipelines](/docs/cdp) makes it easy.

**Gather feedback** from exactly the users you want to reach with no-code [surveys](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys) that launch instantly.

**Integrate revenue data** from [Stripe](/docs/cdp/sources/stripe) and other sources using data warehouse, so you can get a clear picture of what changes really move the needle.

**Get unblocked by PostHog’s helpful sales and support teams,** ensuring you get the insights and information you need quickly.

## Good news for engineering teams

PostHog is designed for developers. We’ve got a dedicated technical staff standing by to help keep you on track. When you reach out to support, you’ll be talking to someone who knows the technical details of the product really well.

While other products are low-velocity black boxes, we’re constantly making PostHog better.

The project is [developed in the open](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), with a [public roadmap](/roadmap) and [dozens of pull requests landing](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) each week.

Giving other teams the data they want becomes much easier with PostHog in the mix, with lower friction for engineering, and loads of features everyone can use without complex setup.

**Consolidate the tools your company needs**, with one login, one integration, one bill, and one [deep set of docs](/docs).

**Get a data platform that encourages tinkering**: if something doesn’t fit quite right for your team, it’s easy to customize everything from visualizations to integrations with other services. We'll host all these customizations for you. You don't need to worry about infrastructure or uptime.

Speaking of uptime, **integrating PostHog with other tools or even your own services is easy**, thanks to [data pipelines](/docs/cdp).

**Roll features out gradually** using [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags) that are easy to target with fine-grained queries across everything PostHog knows about your users.

We also care about the technical details of switching over. No matter your stack or existing tools, **complete integration and [migration docs](/docs/migration)** mean a clear path instead of a puzzle to solve. Our experienced Sales and CS team can even provide backup for more complex cases.

## Make the case to executives

We’re in this for a long-term relationship, so **PostHog wants you to spend as little money as possible**. Our sales team actually works with customers to reduce bills and optimize consumption. Instead of sneaky billing, we’d prefer to make more money as a result of you winning more business.

**Your team will like PostHog**. It’s fresh, always getting fixes, improvements and additional power. An investment in PostHog today means even more capabilities by next year.

**There's no per-seat charge**, so PostHog makes it easy for everyone on your team to make data-driven decisions. No matter how quickly you scale your team, your costs remain fixed to the actual usage of your product. 

**PostHog’s sales process is transparent and so is the whole company**: the company [handbook is public](/handbook), *even documenting the ways we can offer [discounts](/handbook/growth/sales/billing#coupons-and-discounts)*. Everything you want to know about pricing, processes and our product is publicly documented.

There’s just no sneaky stuff going on here. You can get started immediately with no shenanigans, no calls with the sales team.

PostHog wants this transition to be easy, so you can have a trial to fully vet the costs and impact of your integration. Trying this is low-risk, no cost, and fully reversible.

Relatedly, PostHog doesn’t require a contract. You can save a bit of money with one, but it’s not a gate to getting started and trying things out.

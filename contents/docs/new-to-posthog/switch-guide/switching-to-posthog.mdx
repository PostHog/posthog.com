For new projects and companies, PostHog is an easy sell: one login and simple integration gets you everything you need to build great products.

But if you're already leaning on another tool, switching can require some planning and diplomacy. We made you a cheatsheet to help make the case.

***

## Advantages for everyone

PostHog is one login and one bill.

This means less headache for more power, with all your data available across a range of products that help you understand user behavior as it happens.

You'll get a responsive team that cares about user needs, delivering improvements and customer requests constantly.

PostHog is completely agnostic to the language, framework, and stack you build your product with. You can adopt it incrementally, adding new functionality as needed.

Best of all, PostHog is modern, constantly improving, and built so that you’ll actually enjoy using it.

## Persuading product teams

PostHog gives product teams the power to understand users, improve adoption, and test assumptions. Your product teammates can dive in immediately without having to wait for engineers to write new code or hook up an integration.

- **[Visualize anything](/docs/product-analytics/insights)** with charts, trend reporting, and [dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) that are easy to build, but also deeply customizable for SQL enthusiasts.

- **Learn anything you want** about everything the user touches in the product without manual instrumentation with [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture).

- **Get clarity about navigation** and user priorities with [heatmaps](/docs/toolbar/heatmaps).

- Use [session replay](/docs/session-replay/installation) to **reveal bugs, expose friction, and help instantly answer questions** like “is this new design working?”

- **Integrate revenue data** from [Stripe](/docs/cdp/sources/stripe) and other sources using data warehouse, so you can get a clear picture of what changes really move the needle.

- **Send events and other details to any other tool**, powering automations and keeping data in sync, with setup you can accomplish in seconds, fully customizable for any API or webhook. [Data pipelines](/docs/cdp) makes it easy.

- **Gather feedback and book user interviews** from exactly the users you want to reach with no-code [surveys](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys) that launch instantly.

- **Get unblocked by PostHog’s helpful sales and support teams,** ensuring you get the insights and information you need quickly.

## Good news for engineering teams

PostHog is designed for developers.

The project is [developed in the open](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), with a [public roadmap](/roadmap) and [dozens of pull requests landing](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) each week. While other products are low-velocity black boxes, we’re constantly making PostHog better.

 We’ve got a dedicated technical staff standing by to help keep you on track. When you reach out to support, you’ll be talking to someone who knows the technical details of the product really well.

Giving other teams the data they want becomes much easier with PostHog in the mix, lowering the burden on engineering. Once a basic integration is in place, there are loads of features everyone can use without a developer's intervention.

- **Consolidate the tools your company needs**, with one login, one integration, one bill.

- **[Get comprehensive documentation](/docs)** developers love for every every stack, framework, and language. You can also view [our source code directly](http://github.com/postHog/) if you can't find what you need. 

- **Get a data platform that encourages tinkering**: if something doesn’t fit quite right for your team, it’s easy to customize everything from visualizations to integrations with other services. We'll host all these customizations for you. You don't need to worry about infrastructure or uptime.

- **Integrating PostHog with other tools or even your own services is easy**, thanks to [data pipelines](/docs/cdp).

- **Roll features out gradually** using [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags) that are easy to target with fine-grained queries across everything PostHog knows about your users.

We also care about the technical details of switching over. No matter your stack or existing tools, **complete integration and [migration docs](/docs/migration)** mean a clear path instead of a puzzle to solve. Our experienced Sales and CS team can even provide backup for more complex cases.

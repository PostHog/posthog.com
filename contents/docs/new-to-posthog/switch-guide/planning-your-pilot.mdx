We want you to love using PostHog. We’ve worked hard to craft a tool that can make you much more effective at giving your customers what they want.

Here's how to get the most out of a pilot test with your team.

## Invite the people who care about user behavior, no matter their role

PostHog charges by how successful your product is, not how many people have a login.

That means anyone and everyone on your crew can explore at no extra cost. As your integration comes online, think about who else you’d like to invite. You'll have the option to invite them during setup, and any time after that.

## Get help if you want it

For companies sized 25 and up, [we’ve got a team](/talk-to-a-human) who can answer questions and help you make a plan.

But only if you want the help! They’re not going to pressure you or do anything corny, but their integration experience can save time and trouble. They can also help you map PostHog features to your business goals, developing a useful mental model for using all our products.

But we’re not going to get in your way, either, because…

## We want you to play around

The most important job is getting familiar with PostHog in whatever way makes you most comfortable. The most basic integration takes 5 minutes and we’ve got loads of documentation to support you exploring on your own.

## First two weeks: get data in, then look at it

Job one is making sure PostHog is reliably ingesting your data and reporting the basics in a dashboard. Once this is working, take a break, order a pizza[^1].

From here, you can get more sophisticated:

- **Decide**: Your [North Star metric](/docs/new-to-posthog/getting-hogpilled)  
- **Decide**: Make an event tracking plan, or rely on autocapture?  
- **Decide**: Use [identified or anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events)?  
- Configure a [reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy) to improve reliability of event capture  
- Experiment with measuring [activation](/docs/new-to-posthog/activation) and [retention](/docs/new-to-posthog/retention)  
- [Watch some session replays](https://app.posthog.com/project/replay/home), see what you can learn  
- Try out a [no-code survey](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys) to learn what customers are feeling about your product
- Fire up [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics/getting-started), see if you like it better than your existing provider

After two weeks to explore, check in with your teammates as well. See if there’s anything they want but aren't getting. If you can get them excited with you, you'll have a better chance of making this pilot turn into a full-on switch.

## Assess costs

After a couple weeks, you should have a decent picture of how much activity PostHog is tracking, and you can use that to understand your costs.

From here there’s no sneaky stuff. All our [pricing is posted publicly](/pricing), and you can see your projected spend in [your billing settings](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing). 

Think it's too much? Check out our guides on cutting costs for [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics/cutting-costs), [session replay](/docs/session-replay/cutting-costs), and [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/cutting-costs).

You don't need to worry about a surprise billing spike as you're getting started. If something unexpected happens, just [get in touch](/talk-to-a-human). We’ll work it out with you. We need your trust and enthusiasm way more than we need a month of charges you weren't expecting.

We’re in this for the long-haul. If you want more time to evaluate, and our generous free tier isn’t going to cover your volume of usage, just tell us about it. We can offer you a longer no-cost trial so you can be completely confident in switching over.

It means a lot to us that you want to make this switch. We've got your back.

## Migration planning

Once you’re clear on the path forward, we’ve got you covered on historical data as well.

Let's talk about everything you need to [plan a migration](/docs/new-to-posthog/switch-guide/migration-planning).

title: Understanding PostHog

PostHog is a lot of power, so to get the most from it, we should review how data is structured, grouped, and related.

### Events

PostHog's data model starts with **[events](/docs/data/events)**, single actions that a user triggered at a specific point in time. These are sent either from one of our [SDKs](/docs/libraries) or directly via our [API](/docs/api).

Events are flexible: they can be captured automatically, via [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), or you can emit your own [custom events](/docs/getting-started/send-events), attaching additional metadata via [properties](/docs/data/events#event-properties).

You might create an event to represent purchasing an upgrade, with custom properties like `price` or `renewal_period`.

### Actions

[Actions](/docs/data/actions) are a layer on top of events. Define actions to aggregate multiple events, extract a specific kind of event according to its properties, or give an event a more useful name.

### Sessions

A [session](/docs/data/sessions) is a stream of events corresponding to a specific usage session of a product. Sessions have properties, and you can query them.

### Person profiles

Meanwhile, users of your product are given a **[person profile](/docs/data/persons)**, which gather these events. Person profiles similarly contain properties. Some are set automatically:

- browser details
- geo IP data
- referrers
- UTM values

You can also set your own properties on person profiles, which will appear in reports and data tables.

If a user upgrades to a paid tier, for example, you could set a property called `paid_tier` with the details.

Person profiles need [distinct identifiers](/docs/getting-started/identify-users), so PostHog can accurately track behavior. You might see a few identifiers on each profile: anonymous IDs created before a user has been identified, an ID you set after they log in, and IDs that are created on the client and backend, later merged together into a single profile.

### Displaying and organizing data

To make sense of the many events and person profiles flowing through your product, use:

**[Insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights)** to create charts, tables and more that summarize your data.

**[Dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards)** to assemble insights into a cohesive, customizable view.

**[Notebooks](/docs/notebooks)** to contextualize insights and share analysis with your teammates.

### Discovering activity with cohorts and groups

You can create ongoing queries to surface person profiles either according to their properties, or the details of their events. We call these **[cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts)**. If you want to see a list of every user in your paid tier, you could query for all profiles where that `paid_tier` property has been set. Your cohort would then show you a periodically-updated listing of your paid customers.

Alternatively, you might want to understand *group behavior*. By defining **[groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics)**, you can see a cross-section of events across multiple person profiles. This can be helpful if you're selling to multi-seat customers, and want to understand the overall behavior of their users.

Groups require that you have the [Group analytics add-on](/addons#group-analytics) and that you enable person profiles.

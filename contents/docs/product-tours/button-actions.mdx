<Alpha />

Each Product Tour step (or modal announcement) has a primary button and, optionally, a secondary button. Toggle on **custom buttons** in the Product Tour editor to configure your steps with these actions:

## Next step

Default primary button behavior - moves your tour to the next step.

_Not available for announcements._

## Previous step

Default secondary button behavior - moves your tour to the previous step.

**Note:** if your tour causes users to navigate to another page, this action **will not navigate them back.** In these cases, we recommend disabling the secondary button, or swapping to a different action.

_Not available for announcements._

## Start tour

Ends the current tour and starts another one. This is great for triggering product tours from [announcements](/docs/product-tours/creating-announcements)!

## Open link

Opens a given link in a new tab.

## Dismiss

Dismisses the current tour or announcement.

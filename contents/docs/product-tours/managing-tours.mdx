## Launching a tour

Tours won't show until you launch them, regardless of targeting method.

1. Go to your tour in [Product tours](https://us.posthog.com/product-tours)
2. Click **Launch**

### Auto-launch

When auto-launch is enabled, the tour automatically shows when a user meets all targeting conditions.

If auto-launch is disabled, the tour won't show automatically. This is useful if you want to trigger tours programmatically or from other tours.

## Stopping a tour

To stop a running tour, click **Stop**. The tour stops showing immediately.

## Editing live tours

You can edit a running tour. Changes take effect immediately:

- Content changes (text, images, buttons)
- Targeting changes (URL, user filters)
- Appearance changes (colors, positioning)

## Archiving tours

Archive a tour to remove it from your active tours list. You can archive any launched tour, whether it's running or stopped.

If the tour is currently running, archiving will stop it immediately. Archived tours:

- Stop showing to users immediately (if running)
- Move to the Archived tab
- Keep their analytics data
- Can be restored at any time

## Deleting tours

Delete permanently removes a tour and cannot be undone.

Delete is only available for:

- **Draft tours** – tours that have never been launched
- **Archived tours** – launched tours that have been archived

Launched tours must be archived first before they can be deleted.

> **Note:** Tour interaction events in your data are not affected by deletion. Only the tour configuration is removed.

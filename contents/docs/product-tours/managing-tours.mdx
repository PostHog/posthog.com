## Launching a tour

Tours won't show until you launch them, regardless of targeting method.

1. Go to your tour in [Product tours](https://us.posthog.com/product-tours)
2. Click **Launch**

### Auto-launch

When auto-launch is enabled, the tour automatically shows when a user meets all targeting conditions.

If auto-launch is disabled, the tour won't show automatically. This is useful if you want to trigger tours programmatically or from other tours.

## Stopping a tour

To stop a running tour, click **Stop**. The tour stops showing immediately.

## Editing live tours

You can edit a running tour. Changes take effect immediately:

- Content changes (text, images, buttons)
- Targeting changes (URL, user filters)
- Appearance changes (colors, positioning)

## Archiving tours

Archive a tour when you no longer need it. Archived tours:

- Stop showing to users immediately
- Remain in the archived tab for reference
- Keep their analytics data
- Can be restored if needed

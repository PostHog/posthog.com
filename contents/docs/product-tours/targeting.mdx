Targeting controls who sees your tours and when they appear. A user must match **all** conditions to see a tour.

## URL conditions

Show tours on specific pages using URL matching.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Exact** | URL must match exactly | `https://app.example.com/dashboard` |
| **Contains** | URL must contain the string | `/dashboard` matches any URL with `/dashboard` |
| **Regex** | URL must match the pattern | `/users/[0-9]+` |

The URL is matched against the full `window.location.href`.

## User targeting

Target specific users using [feature flag](/docs/feature-flags) filters. Every tour has an auto-created internal feature flag, and you can add targeting filters to control who sees the tour.

This lets you show tours to:

- Users with specific properties (e.g., `plan = pro`)
- Users in specific [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts)
- A percentage of users (rollout)

## Auto-launch delay

Set a delay (in seconds) before the tour appears after the page loads. This is useful when:

- You want users to orient themselves before the tour starts
- Target elements load asynchronously

## Display frequency

Controls how often a tour shows to users.

**Tours** show until the user interacts with them (completes or dismisses). Once a user interacts, they won't see the tour again.

**Announcements** have configurable display frequencies:

| Type | Options |
|------|---------|
| **Modal announcements** | Show once (default), or until interacted |
| **Banners** | Until interacted (default), or always |

This is handled via person properties:
- `$product_tour_completed/{tour_id}`
- `$product_tour_dismissed/{tour_id}`

These properties are set automatically and used to filter out users who have already interacted with a tour.

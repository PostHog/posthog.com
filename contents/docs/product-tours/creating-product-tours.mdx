Product tours are multi-step walkthroughs that highlight elements in your UI. You build them visually using the PostHog toolbar directly on your site.

## Launch the toolbar

1. Go to [Product tours](https://us.posthog.com/product-tours) in PostHog
2. Click **New tour** and select **Product tour**
3. Enter the URL where you want to build the tour and click **Open toolbar**

## Select elements

Click elements on your page to create steps. PostHog generates a CSS selector for each element automatically.

>**Note:** If your target elements do not have stable selectors like `id` or `data-*`, the tour may fail to correctly identify them. We're working on a new element-finding algorithm, stay tuned!

## Add step content

Use the toolbar for element selection and quick edits. The main PostHog app provides a unified WYSIWYG editor for all step types with tour-wide settings in a right-side panel.

Both editors support rich text formatting including bold, italic, links, and images.

## Step progression

Steps can progress via buttons or when the user clicks the target element. Guide users through real interactions, not just info.

## Step types

### Element steps

The default. Highlights a specific element with a tooltip. Positioning is automatic based on available viewport space.

### Modal steps

Screen-positioned dialogs not anchored to any element. Useful for welcome messages or summary screens.

### Survey steps

Embed a survey question mid-tour (open text or rating scale). Responses are captured as events.

## Save and launch

Click **Save** in the toolbar to save your tour as a draft. When ready, [launch the tour](/docs/product-tours/managing-tours).

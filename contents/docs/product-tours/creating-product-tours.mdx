Product tours are multi-step walkthroughs that highlight elements in your UI. You build them visually using the PostHog toolbar directly on your site.

## Launch the toolbar

1. Go to [Product tours](https://us.posthog.com/product-tours) in PostHog
2. Click **New tour** and select **Product tour**
3. Enter the URL where you want to build the tour and click **Open toolbar**

## Select elements

Click elements on your page to create steps. PostHog generates a CSS selector for each element automatically.

>**Note:** If your target elements do not have stable selectors like `id` or `data-*`, the tour may fail to correctly identify them. We're working on a new element-finding algorithm, stay tuned!

## Add step content

Edit your tour content in the main PostHog app using the WYSIWYG editor. The editor preview reflects your style settings (colors, fonts, border radius) as you edit, so you can see exactly how your tour will appear to users.

The toolbar on your site is primarily for selecting elements and previewing how steps look in context.

## Step progression

Steps can progress via buttons or when the user clicks the target element. Guide users through real interactions, not just info.

## Step types

### Element steps

The default. Highlights a specific element with a tooltip. Positioning is automatic based on available viewport space.

### Modal steps

Screen-positioned dialogs not anchored to any element. Useful for welcome messages or summary screens.

### Survey steps

Embed a survey question mid-tour (open text or rating scale). Responses are captured as events.

## Save and launch

Click **Save** in the toolbar to save your tour as a draft. When ready, [launch the tour](/docs/product-tours/managing-tours).

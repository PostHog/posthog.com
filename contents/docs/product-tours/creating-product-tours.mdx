Product tours are multi-step walkthroughs that highlight elements in your UI. You build them visually using the PostHog toolbar directly on your site.

## Launch the toolbar

1. Go to [Product tours](https://us.posthog.com/product-tours) in PostHog
2. Click **New tour** and select **Product tour**
3. Enter the URL where you want to build the tour and click **Open toolbar**

## Select elements

Click elements on your page to create steps. PostHog generates a CSS selector for each element automatically.

>**Note:** If your target elements do not have stable selectors like `id` or `data-*`, the tour may fail to correctly identify them. We're working on a new element-finding algorithm, stay tuned!

## Edit step content

After creating steps with the toolbar, edit your tour in the main PostHog app. The unified editing page includes:

- **Step sidebar** – Navigate between steps on the left
- **WYSIWYG editor** – Edit content in the center with live appearance styling
- **Settings panel** – Configure display conditions and theme on the right

The WYSIWYG editor supports:

- Rich text formatting (headings, bold, italic, underline, lists)
- Text alignment and color
- Image and video embedding
- Link insertion
- Slash commands (`/`) for quick formatting

## Configure step settings

Each step has settings you can configure below the content editor:

- **Target element** – Choose Auto mode or enter a CSS selector manually
- **Advance on** – Progress via the Next button or when users click the target element
- **Position** – For modal steps, select where on screen the modal appears
- **Buttons** – Add, remove, or customize button text and actions


## Step types

### Element steps

The default. Highlights a specific element with a tooltip. Positioning is automatic based on available viewport space.

### Modal steps

Screen-positioned dialogs not anchored to any element. Useful for welcome messages or summary screens.

### Survey steps

Embed a survey question mid-tour (open text or rating scale). Responses are captured as events.

## Save and launch

Click **Save** in the toolbar to save your tour as a draft. When ready, [launch the tour](/docs/product-tours/managing-tours).

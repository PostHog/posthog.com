Announcements are single-step messages for when you don't need a full multi-step tour. Buttons can open links or trigger a product tour, making announcements a great entry point for onboarding flows.

## Modal announcements

Popups for important messages like feature launches, changelogs, or welcome messages. Modals can be positioned anywhere on screen and support rich content with buttons.

/>

To create one:

1. Go to [Product tours](https://us.posthog.com/product-tours)
2. Click **New tour** → **Announcement** → **Modal**

## Banner announcements

Top-of-page alerts for less intrusive messages like promotions or maintenance notices. Banners can be sticky (stay visible while scrolling) or static.

2. Click **New tour** → **Announcement** → **Banner**

### Banner settings

Banners have additional configuration options:

- **Position**: Choose between sticky (stays visible while scrolling), static (scrolls with content), or custom (inject into a specific container element using a CSS selector).
- **Click action**: Set what happens when users click the banner – open a link, trigger another product tour, or do nothing.

## Targeting

Announcements use the same targeting options as product tours. See [Targeting](/docs/product-tours/targeting) for details.

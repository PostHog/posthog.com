Product tours are multi-step walkthroughs that highlight elements in your UI and guide users through features. You build them visually using the PostHog toolbar.

### How it works

1. Launch the toolbar on your site
2. Click elements to create steps
3. Add content with the rich text editor
4. Configure buttons and actions
5. Save and launch

Each step can highlight a specific element, show a modal, or even include an embedded survey question.

Announcements are single-step messages for when you don't need a full tour. Choose between:

- **Modals** - Centered popups for important messages, changelogs, or feature launches
- **Banners** - Top or bottom page alerts for subtle notifications

You can create announcements directly from the PostHog app without using the toolbar.

Control who sees your tours and when they appear:

- **URL matching** - Show on specific pages (exact, contains, or regex)
- **User properties** - Target specific user segments via built-in [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags)

Users who interact with a tour (complete or dismiss) won't see it again.

Make tours match your brand:

- **Colors** - Background, text, buttons, borders
- **Layout** - Border radius, shadows, positioning
- **Typography** - Custom font family
- **Behavior** - Overlay, dismiss on click outside
- **White-label** - Hide PostHog branding

    subtitle="Required"

Once your tour is ready, set a start date to launch it. PostHog automatically tracks:

- **Shown** - How many users saw the tour
- **Completed** - How many finished all steps
- **Dismissed** - How many closed early
- **Tour funnel** - Shows step-by-step where users drop off

### Integrate with product analytics

Tour events work with the rest of PostHog. Create funnels to see if tours improve activation, or use [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) to target users who haven't completed onboarding.

Person properties like `$product_tour_completed/{id}` are set automatically, so you can filter and segment based on tour interactions.

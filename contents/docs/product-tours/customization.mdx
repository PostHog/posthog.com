<Alpha />

Customize the appearance of your tours to match your brand. All customization settings are found in the **Theme** section of the **Tour settings** panel on the right side of the editing page.

The editor shows a live WYSIWYG preview with your theme settings applied, so you can see exactly how your tour will look as you customize it.

## Colors

- **Background** – Background of tour steps, modals, and banners
- **Text** – Body text color
- **Button** – Primary button background (not available for banners)
- **Border** – Borders around steps and modals. Select "None" to remove borders.

## Typography

Set a custom font family. The font must be available on your site.

## Layout

- **Border radius** – Corner roundness for tour steps (0–24px)
- **Button radius** – Corner roundness for buttons (0–24px)
- **Box shadow** – Choose from preset shadow options or remove shadows entirely

### Width

Control step width by dragging the resize handle on the editor preview. Width can range from 200px to 700px.

### Modal position

For modal steps and announcements, choose the screen position: center (default), corners, or edges.

Element step positioning is automatic based on available viewport space.

## Behavior

- **Dark overlay** – Show a dark overlay behind the tour to focus attention

## White-label

Remove PostHog branding from tours. Branding only appears on the first step.

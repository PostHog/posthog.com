Product Tours can progress in one of two ways: **button click** or **element click**.

These options are available in the **Advance on...** section of tour step settings in both the Toolbar and PostHog's main app.

## Next button

This is the default behavior for new tour steps. We show a button that takes the user to the next step in your tour.

To learn more about customizing this button and its behavior, see [Button actions](/docs/product-tours/button-actions).

## Element click

For more interactive tours, you can choose **Element click** as a step's progression trigger.

With this option we will not show a **Next** button by default, and users get to the next step by clicking on the current step's element.

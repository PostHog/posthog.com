## Dashboard metrics

Every tour shows these metrics in the PostHog UI:

- **Shown** - How many users saw the tour (unique and total)
- **Completed** - How many users finished all steps
- **Dismissed** - How many users closed early
- **Tour funnel** - Shows step-by-step where users drop off

## Events

Product tours capture these events automatically:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `product tour shown` | Tour was displayed |
| `product tour completed` | User finished all steps |
| `product tour dismissed` | User closed early |
| `product tour step shown` | A step was displayed |
| `product tour step completed` | User advanced past a step |
| `product tour step selector failed` | Element selector didn't find the target |

All events include `$tour_id`, `$tour_name`, and step events include `$step_id` and `$step_index`.

## Person properties

These properties are set when users interact with tours:

- `$product_tour_shown/{tour_id}` - Set to `true` when shown
- `$product_tour_completed/{tour_id}` - Set to `true` when completed
- `$product_tour_dismissed/{tour_id}` - Set to `true` when dismissed

Use these for targeting other tours or creating [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts).

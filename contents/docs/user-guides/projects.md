To facilitate tracking various products within the same organization, it's possible to have multiple projects within a single [PostHog organization](/docs/user-guides/organizations), letting you segregate data and analysis workflows completely and safely. This way you can for example keep tracking separate for your development and production environments, or track multiple domains and apps without merging the data.  

You can switch between projects, as well as create new ones, from the top bar. Project settings can be reached from the sidebar.

Each project has its own distinct write-only token, which you can use to initialize your [integration of choice](/docs/integrate/overview), as well as to connect to our [API](/docs/api/overview).

> **Note:** Multiple projects within an organization belong to our premium team-oriented offering. To use this feature, [set up PostHog Cloud billing](https://posthog.com/pricing?o=cloud) or [contact us](https://share.hsforms.com/1-IVCY9gNRvaZBajMt_UPIg4559u) for a self-hosted license.

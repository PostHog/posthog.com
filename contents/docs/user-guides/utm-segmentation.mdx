UTM parameters are a set 5 five parameters that allow you to track the effectiveness of marketing 
campaigns across traffic sources. These parameters were first introduced by Google Analytics but are 
now a common way to figure out sources for a website. The parameters are attached to a link using 
query parameters, for example:

https://www.example.com/page?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=twitter-campaign

Posthog supports all 5 paremeters:

| Parameter    | Purpose                                                                                       | Example                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| utm_source   | Identifies which site sent the traffic, for example, traffic from Google or Facebook.         | utm_source=google               |
| utm_medium   | Allows you to track the type of link was used, for example cost per click, or social sharing. | utm_medium=cpc                  |
| utm_campaign | Helps identify specific promotions or campaigns, for example, when you run an ad campaign.    | utm_campaign=google-ad-campaign. |
| utm_content  | Can be used to differentiate the same link on different places.                               | utm_content=footer-link         |
| utm_term     | Used to identify paid keyword searches.                                                       | utm_term=analytics+open+source  |

> Note that UTM properties only appear if they were set, **at least for any linked page**.

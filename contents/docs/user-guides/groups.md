# What are groups and how are they different to cohorts?
Groups are how you track and perform analysis on an aggregation of something. The simplest example of a group is a company, you have users from multiple companies that might use your product - groups allows you do to analytics (and much more) on companies rather than only users - e.g. Daily Active Companies.

Groups are not limited to companies they can be of any type you determine

Groups differ from cohorts, a cohort is a essentially a list of users, whereas a group represents multiple entities which multiple users might be associated with. Following the company example again from above, you can might a cohort of users who belong to a certain company. But you could create a type of group which represent all companies and the users associated with them.

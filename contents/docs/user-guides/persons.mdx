PostHog tracks user behaviour, whether or not the user is logged in and identifiable.

## Viewing user list

Click on 'Persons & Groups' on the left-hand navigation. This will open a list containing all users, which you can then search.

If you have added properties to your users (e.g. email), these will also appear here.

Clicking the arrows next to the user will expand and show all of that user's properties.

## User history

Clicking on an individual person brings up their entire event history, as well as their properties.

You can go even deeper by inspecting each event individually. Clicking on the event will bring up all the event properties.

## Deleting person data

-   Select 'Persons & Groups' from the left-hand menu
-   Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email
-   Click on the person's ID
-   Click 'Delete person' to remove them and all their associated data from the PostHog instance. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

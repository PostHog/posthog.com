Stickiness is a type of [Insight](/docs/user-guides/insights) that allows you to see how many times users perform a specific event in a period of time.

These analyses are useful in tracking if an event is particularly engaging for users. For example, while you may track Weekly Active Users (WAU) using our Trend insight, stickiness would allow you to distill the WAUs who are highly engaged within that week.

## Using Stickiness

Select the event you want to see the stickiness for in the drop down menu on the Stickiness tab under "Steps".

The y-axis on the graph will correspond to the number of unique users or groups. THe x-axis corresponds to the number of times the user or group has performed the event in the specified time period. 

You can edit Stickiness further by:
- Adding more events that you want to compare the Stickiness of
- Changing the time range or interval

## Viewing individual users

You can drill down into specific users who have performed an event or action multiple times:

- Hover a particular data point on your stickiness graph
- Click on the datapoint to bring up a list of users related to that data point
- You can create a cohort of those users directly from the modal that appears

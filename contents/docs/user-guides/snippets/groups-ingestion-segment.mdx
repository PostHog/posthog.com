Not all libraries support group analytics yet, but you can work around this issue by sending events in specific formats.

This section uses our [Capture APIs](https://posthog.com/docs/api/post-only-endpoints) for examples but you can adapt this
approach to any library.

#### Capturing events with groups

```js
analytics.track('[event name]', {
    "$groups": {
        "company": "id:5"
    }
})

```

#### Updating group properties

```js
analytics.track('$groupidentify', {
    "$group_type": "company",
    "$group_key": "id:5",
    "$group_set": {
        "company_name": "Awesome Inc",
        "employees": 11
    }
})
```

We love contributions to PostHog, big or small. Here's what you need to know about contributing to our product:

## Being a part of the community

We have an awesome, diverse, and inclusive community. In order to maintain and grow this, all community members must adhere to our [Code of conduct](/docs/contribute/code-of-conduct).

## Reporting bugs or issues

Bug reports help us make PostHog better for everyone. When you [report a bug](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new/choose), the description will automatically be filled with a template that makes is very clear what we'd like you to add.

Before raising a new issue, please [search within existing ones](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues) to make sure you're not creating a duplicate.

    <b>Important:</b> If your issue is related to security, please email us directly at <a href="mailto:hey@posthog.com">hey@posthog.com</a> instead of creating a GitHub issue.

## Deciding what to work on

We maintain [a list of good first issues](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are a great way to get started contributing to the PostHog open-source product analytics platform. You can also pick up any other open tickets, though they may be more complicated to work with. If in doubt, just leave a comment for the author of the issue! Outside of tickets, if there are small improvements to layout, text, or functionality, feel free to create a pull request directly.

You can also [update PostHog's documentation, handbook, or write a blog post](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/developing-the-website). We maintain [a list of good first issues](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) here too. Take a look at our [style guide](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md) before getting started.

If you're planning to work on a bigger feature that is not on the list of issues, please raise an issue first so we can check whether that feature makes sense for PostHog as a whole.

## Writing and submitting code

Anyone can contribute code to PostHog, including you! To get started, follow our [local development guide](/handbook/engineering/developing-locally). Then, make your change and submit a pull request to the [`posthog` repository](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog). We'll be delighted to review your change.

At PostHog we aim to recognize all contributions made to our open source codebases. We do this largely via automated processes that ensure our contributors are recognized. 

## Pull requests

If you submit a Pull Request to a repository under the `PostHog` organization, a bot will automatically send you an email to get in touch with us for a merch code. 

We usually give out up to $100 for a product or app-related PR at our discretion, and $25 for something on posthog.com (but we have gone over and above this for particularly large community PRs before!)

If, after a few days of having had your PR merged, you still didn't get a merch code, you can email us at _[hey@posthog.com](mailto:hey@posthog.com)_ and we'll sort it out! Someone on the PostHog team will send you a code [manually](/handbook/company/merch-store#individuals).

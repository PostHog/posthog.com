### Getting started
If you have not, be sure to review [Development workflow](/docs/contribute/development-workflow) which covers details of pull requests, branching and more.

#### Deployment
The updated documentation website will deploy automatically once a pull request has been merged into the `master` 
branch. The build takes 5-10 minutes.

### Clone PostHog.com

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com
```

## Finding the content to edit

Once you have cloned the repo, the `contents/` directory contains a few key areas:

* `docs/` = all of the documentation for PostHog's platform
* `handbook/` = the PostHog company handbook
* `blog/` = our blog posts

Inside each of these are a series of markdown files for you to edit.

## Markdown details

#### Frontmatter

At the top of the file, it is necessary to have the following for the page to appear:

```markdown
---
title: Example Title
sidebarTitle: Example title shown in sidebar
sidebar: Example Sidebar
showTitle: true
---
```

- `title`: the page title
- `sidebar`: the sidebar menu that the page will attach to. You can see a list of available sidebars in `/src/sidebars/sidebars.json`. You can choose not to have a sidebar by setting this to `null`.
- `sidebarTitle`: the title shown in the sidebar. If this value isn't provided the `title` property is used.
- `showTitle` should always be set to `true`.

#### Images/GIFs

For our Markdown, we use [gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files/).

This copies local files linked to/from Markdown files to the root directory.

Place images in `contents/images/`.

To include an image in a markdown file, you can use nice local references, like so:

```markdown
![Twin Peaks](../images/02/IMG_4294-scaled.jpg)
```

Note that it may be necessary to change the folder depending on your file structure. For example, if you needed to go up two directories, this *could* be:

```markdown
![Twin Peaks](../../images/02/IMG_4294-scaled.jpg)
```

Notice the extra ```../```.

For most images, this plugin will automatically generate a range of sizes to optimize for the device and they'll even have a blurry low filesize loading image created to hold the place. Pretty cool.

#### Links to/from the navigation

Once you've made a new markdown file, you should link to it from the sidebar where appropriate.

The sidebar is generated from `/src/sidebars/sidebars.json`.

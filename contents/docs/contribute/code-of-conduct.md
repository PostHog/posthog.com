## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## No solicitation

The following are not allowed within any community space without prior permission 
from the community moderators:

- Pitching of a business, product, or service (outside of the introductions channel). Keep it non spammy!
- Trying to hire the PostHog core team to work on your thing. We need them to build our thing.
- Market or competitor research. This is just annoying.
- Encouraging a fork of the main PostHog project or promoting / soliciting people to build a service that competes directly with us. You may be able to do some of this legally, but if it's successful it would harm our project's performance. So, it's not in the project's interest to provide a place to promote something like this. If you want to partner, email sales at our company.com so we can work something out.

It's feasible that a community member may do something outside of the list above that we've not foreseen which isn't in the project's best interest. We will handle these cases carefully when they come up and will edit these guidelines accordingly.

If you're unsure, contact the community moderators via hey@posthog.com.

## Enforcement responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
hey@posthog.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of conduct:

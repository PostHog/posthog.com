System and Organization Control 2 Type 2 [(SOC 2)](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) is a compliance framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants [(AICPA)](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/landing/financial-literacy-resources) that focuses on how an organization's services remain secure and protect customer data. The framework contains 5 Trust Services Categories [(TSCs)](https://www.schellman.com/blog/soc-examinations/soc-2-trust-services-criteria-with-tsc), which contain criteria to evaluate the controls and service commitments of an organization.

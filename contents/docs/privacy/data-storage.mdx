This guide covers the various features available **after data reaches PostHog Cloud servers** to help you achieve your privacy goals. If you have data that cannot reach a third-party server like PostHog, please omit them during [data collection](/docs/privacy/data-collection).

This guide covers the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Data storage location](#data-storage-location) | Control where your data is physically stored for GDPR compliance |
| [Processing data before storage](#processing-data-before-storage) | Redact or filter data before it's stored in PostHog |
| [Data deletion](#data-deletion) | Tools to help comply with data deletion requests |
| [Data access control](#data-access-control) | Manage who can access what data in PostHog | 

## Data storage location

If you require GDPR compliance, there are [specific guidelines](docs/privacy/gdpr-compliance#you-should-not-transfer-eu-users-personal-data-outside-the-eu) on the location of data storage if you collect personal data. If you require robust GDPR compliance, we recommend using [PostHog Cloud EU](/eu) – a managed version of PostHog that's hosted on servers based in Frankfurt.

## Processing data before storage

PostHog supports [realtime transformations](/docs/cdp/transformations) of data **before it's stored in PostHog**. These transformations are applied to all events captured in realtime, so you can use them to:

- [Redacting PII data](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/transformations/template-pii-hashing) before it's stored in PostHog
- Disabling default [GeoIP enrichment transformations](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/transformations/template-geoip)
- [Dropping events](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/transformations/drop-events) based on a filter
- [Hashing PII data](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/transformations/template-hash-properties)
- [IP anonymization](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/transformations/template-ip-anonymization)

When in doubt, you can always create your own [custom transformation](https://us.posthog.com/pipeline/new/transformation/hog-template-blank-transformation). Custom transformations use the [Hog language](/docs/hog) to transform data.

## Data deletion

You can remove unwanted data from PostHog by deleting groups and persons.

| What to delete | Where to delete | Additional details |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Projects** | [Project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#project-delete) | All data under the project (including events) are automatically removed |
| **Organizations** | [Organization settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/organization#organization-delete) | All data under the organization's projects (including events) are automatically removed |
| **Persons** | [In the persons tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons), [by API](#right-to-be-forgotten) | When a person is deleted, all events for that person can be deleted |

### Right to be forgotten

<DistinctIdReuseWarning />

Persons and events can be deleted using our API endpoints. This action requires a [personal API key](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys).

To query all persons in your project, use the [GET Persons API endpoint](/docs/api/persons#get-api-projects-project_id-persons). You can filter for specific subsets of persons using the query parameters. For example, you can get a specific person by filtering by email:

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
export POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=[your personal api key]
curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
    https://us.posthog.com/api/projects/:project_id/persons?email={EMAIL}
```

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://us.posthog.com/api/projects/:project_id/persons?email={EMAIL}', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer [your personal api key]'
  }
})
```

```python
import requests

api_key = "[your personal api key]"
project_id = "[your project id]"
response = requests.get(
    "https://us.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/persons?email={EMAIL}".format(
        project_id=project_id
    ),
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer {}".format(api_key)},
).json()
```

</MultiLanguage>

To delete persons and their events, use the [DELETE Persons API endpoint](/docs/api/persons#delete-api-projects-project_id-persons-id) with the person's UUID (returned as `id` in the persons API response). To delete the person's corresponding events, add the `delete_events=true` parameter:

<MultiLanguage>

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/<project_id>/persons/<person_uuid>?delete_events=true" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <personal_api_key>"
```

```javascript
fetch('https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/<project_id>/persons/<person_uuid>?delete_events=true', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <personal_api_key>'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

```python
import requests

api_key = "<personal_api_key>"
project_id = "<project_id>"
person_uuid = "<person_uuid>"

url = "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/{}/persons/{}?delete_events=true".format(
    project_id, person_uuid
)
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer {}".format(api_key)}

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

</MultiLanguage>

This request will delete all events of the person(s) that have been captured before the deletion request.

### Manual data deletion

You can manually delete persons and their events in the PostHog UI:

- Select **Persons** from the left-hand menu
- Search for the person via their `distinct_id` or a property like email.
- Click **view** next to the person within the search results
- Click **Delete person** to remove them and all their associated data from the PostHog instance. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

### Asynchronous data deletion

While most data in PostHog is deleted instantly, event data is not. Instead data is cleared asynchronously during non-peak usage times (weekends on PostHog Cloud).

This is done because data deletion in [ClickHouse](/docs/how-posthog-works/clickhouse) is expensive and it can impact performance for other users.

## Data access control

An important part of protecting your users' privacy is to control who can access what data in PostHog. PostHog provides access control at 3 levels:

1. [Organization level](/docs/settings/access-control#1-organization-level)
2. [Project level](/docs/settings/access-control#2-project-level)
3. [Resource level](/docs/settings/access-control#3-resource-level)

It's up to you to use these access control features to grant access to only the people who need to access the data.

You can follow this comprehensive guide to [access control](/docs/settings/access-control) to learn more.

## Frequently asked questions

This overview covers some frequently asked questions about PostHog and privacy. Have a question not covered here? Use the 'Ask a question' box at the bottom of the page.

### What is and isn't considered personal data?

It's hard to have a single legal definition of personal data because every legal privacy framework has different ideas, and even names, for it. The GDPR calls it 'personal data' but the US uses the term 'personally identifiable information' (PII) and others refer to it as 'personal information'.

According to the GDPR, personal data is any information which: 

1. Identifies a 'data subject' directly
2. Can be used to identify a 'data subject' when combined with other information

Read our [simple guide to personal data and PII](/blog/what-is-personal-data-pii) for more specific examples to help you identify what personal data you are collecting.

### How does the GDPR impact analytics?

There are three key GDPR principles that impact your use PostHog and analytics in general:

1. You need to have a good reason to collect personal data
2. You need to acquire unambiguous consent
3. Data must be handled securely

Our [guide to personal data](/blog/what-is-personal-data-pii) provides an overview of what's considered personal data under the GDPR, but suffice it to say that its definition is broad.

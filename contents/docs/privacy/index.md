PostHog offers considerable flexibility in hosting and configuration options to comply with privacy regulations around the world.

In these guides, we offer advice for using PostHog in a compliant manner under the following legal frameworks:

- [The General Data Protection Regulation](/docs/privacy/gdpr-compliance/) (GDPR), which applies to all businesses collecting data on EU citizens

- [The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](/docs/privacy/hipaa-compliance/) (HIPAA), which applies to businesses capturing and processing health data in the US

- [The California Consumer Privacy Act](/docs/privacy/ccpa-compliance/), which applies to qualifying for-profit businesses collecting personal information on residents of California

**Please note:** these guides don't constitute legal advice. We recommend seeking professional advice to ensure you remain compliant with relevant legislation.

In addition to these guides, we also provide ongoing [updates and advice on privacy issues](/blog/categories/privacy) on the PostHog blog.

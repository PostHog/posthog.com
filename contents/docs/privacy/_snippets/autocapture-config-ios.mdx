By default, the iOS SDK will make a best effort to avoid capturing password fields, credit card fields, OTP fields, and any other fields related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

If there are other elements of the view hierarchy that you don't want to be captured, you can add an `accessibilityLabel` or `accessibilityIdentifier` of  `ph-no-capture`

```swift
// This view will be excluded from autocapture
let view = UIView()
view.accessibilityLabel = "ph-no-capture"
``` 

These elements will be ignored or masked in product analytics.

In web apps using the PostHog [React Native SDK](/docs/libraries/react-native), the following data can be autocaptured.

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state
-   **Application Became Active** - when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **Application Installed** - when the app is installed.
-   **Application Updated** - when the app is updated.
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (only for `react-native-navigation`, requires calling the `initReactNativeNavigation` method)
-   **$autocapture** - touch events when the user interacts with the screen

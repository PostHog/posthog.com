In web apps using the PostHog [iOS SDK](/docs/libraries/ios), the following data can be autocaptured.

- **Application Opened**: when the app is opened from a closed state or when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
- **Application Backgrounded**: when the app is sent to the background by the user
- **Application Installed**: when the app is installed
- **Application Updated**: when the app is updated
- **$screen**: when the user navigates if using `UIViewController`
- **$autocapture**: when the user interacts with elements in a screen if using `UIKit` 

This autocapture behavior can be further controlled using the `PostHogConfig` object.

import AutocaptureConfig from '../../libraries/ios/_snippets/autocapture-config-ios.mdx'

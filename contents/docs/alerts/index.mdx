Alerts enable you to monitor your insights and get notified when the value of the insight breaches a threshold that you've set (for example, number of unique visitors to your site increased by 5% week over week).
Currently alerts are supported on all [trends](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/trends) (support for [funnels](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/funnels) coming soon!).


## How to create an alert?
1. Alerts are based off of insight. You can pick any existing trend insight or create a new one.
2. Click on the "Alerts" button on top right of the insight page. This shows you all the alerts you've setup for this insight.

3. Click on 'New alert'

4. Set a name for the alert

5. Pick which 'series' you want to alert on. These are the different events/values you're plotting in the insight. 
    For example, an insight might have multiple series like `A - Pageviews` (total count of page views for a URL) and `B - Unique visitors` (count of unique visitors). 
    You can pick either `A` or `B` which will determine if the alert gets checked against the value for `A` (total page views) or `B` (unique visitors).

6. Select the alert type. You can choose to check whether the series value against a specific value ('has value') or whether the value for the series has changed by a certain amount ('increases by'/'decreases by').

7. Set the threshold. This is the value you want to compare the series value against.

8. (Optional) For relative alerts ('increases by'/'decreases by'), you can set a percentage threshold. It compares the percentage change in the series value to the thresholds you've set.

9. Select how often you want the alert to be checked (e.g. every hour, every day, every week, every month)

10. Pick who all should be notified when the alert is triggered. The alert will send an email to everyone in this list when the alert is triggered.

11. Click 'Create alert', and you're done! 

You can now view all the alerts set on the insight. 
To view all the alerts set, you can click on 'Product Analytics' in the sidebar and then click on the 'Alerts' tab.


## Relative alerts
Relative alerts check for change in the value of an insight.
For example, if a value increases by 5% in a week.
To create a relative alert, you just need to change the 'has value' option to 'increases by' or 'decreases by'.
This will then also enable you to set a percentage threshold.

### Thresholds
We support both **absolute value** thresholds (insight value more than or less than a certain number) or **percentage** thresholds (insight value changed by a certain percentage).
Percentage thresholds are only available for relative alerts (as you need to compare two values to figure out percentage change)

## Notification
Currently alerts only support email notifications. We will add more notification options like webhooks and slack soon.


## Alerts on breakdowns
When you set an alert on a trend with a breakdown. 
The alert will be triggered when any of the breakdown values breaches the thresholds set.

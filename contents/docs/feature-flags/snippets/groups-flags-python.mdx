Update [posthog-python](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/server/python) to version 1.4.3 or above to make use of the new functionality.

To check a flag that's matching by companies, specify groups in relevant call:

```python
if posthog.feature_enabled("new-groups-feature", "user_distinct_id", groups={"company": "id:5"}):
    # do something
```

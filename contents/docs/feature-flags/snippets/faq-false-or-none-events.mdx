## My `Feature Flag Called` events show `None` or `false` instead of my variant names

The `Feature Flag Response` property is `false` for users who called your feature flag but did not match any of the rollout conditions.

`None` indicates that feature flag is disabled or failed to load. For example, due to network error or something unexpected.

## My `Feature Flag Called` events show `None`, `(empty string)`, or `false` instead of my variant names

The `Feature Flag Response` property is `false` for users who called your feature flag but did not match any of the rollout conditions.

`None` or `(empty string)` indicates that the feature flag is disabled or failed to load. For example, due to a network error, adblocking, or something unexpected. `(empty string)` also appears when some of the events for an experiment lack feature flag information.

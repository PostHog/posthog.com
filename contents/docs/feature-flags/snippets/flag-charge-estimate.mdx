#### Frontend SDKs

We make a request to fetch feature flags (using the [`/decide` endpoint](/docs/api/decide)) when:

1. The PostHog SDK is initialized
2. A user is [identified](/docs/data/identify) 
3. A user's [properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties) are updated
4. You call `posthog.reloadFeatureFlags()` in your code

For the [JavaScript web SDK](/docs/libraries/js), you can estimate how many feature flag requests you will make by doing the following:

1. Check the networks tab in Chrome inspector tools for the number of `/decide` requests
2. Find out your number of monthly page views
3. Multiply your number of `/decide` requests by your monthly page views

For example, if on refresh, you see 2 `/decide` requests per pageview and you have ~150,000 pageviews, your monthly feature flag requests should be around ~300,000.

#### Backend SDKs

##### Without local evaluation 

If you're not using [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation), a request to get feature flags is made every time you call `posthog.get_feature_flag()` on your backend. Your estimated usage will be however many times you are calling this code.

##### With local evaluation

If you're using [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation), each local evaluation request is equivalent to, and charged as, 10 feature flag requests. Local evaluation calls, by default, are made every 30 seconds. Assuming your server is constantly running and making 2 requests per minute, you will be charged `10 * 2 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 864,000 feature flag requests` each month.

> **Note:** This figure is for a single server and a single instance of PostHog. If you have multiple servers, PostHog instances, or a different poll duration, you need to multiply your estimates too.

Update [posthog-js](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/client/js)2 to version 1.16.0 or above to make use of the new functionality.

In  it's possible to declare that a user is currently "active" in a particular group. This means all events (both normal and autocaptured) are considered to be for that group.

To make sure all events get attached to groups, we recommend calling `posthog.group` in `loaded` callback.

```js
posthog.init('[your api key]', {
    api_host: 'https://posthog.[your-domain].com',
    loaded: function(posthog) {
        posthog.identify('[user unique id]');

        posthog.group('company', 'id:5', {
            company_name: 'Awesome Inc',
            employees: 11
        });

        // A call without properties sets the group on subsequent events
        // but does not update properties
        posthog.group('playlist', 'id:77');
    }
});
```

Subsequent calls to `posthog.group()` with the same group type but a different group key make the new group be active.

#### Handling logging out

When the user logs out it's important to call `posthog.reset()` to avoid new events being registered under registered groups and the logged in user.

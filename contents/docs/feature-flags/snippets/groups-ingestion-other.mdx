Not all libraries support group analytics yet, but you can work around this issue by sending events in specific formats.

This section uses our [Capture APIs](https://posthog.com/docs/api/post-only-endpoints) for examples but you can adapt this
approach to any library.

#### Capturing events with groups

```shell
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "event_name",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "[your users' distinct id]",
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        "$groups": {
            "company": "id:5"
        }
    }
}

```

#### Updating group properties

```shell
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "$groupidentify",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "[your users' distinct id]",
        "$group_type": "company",
        "$group_key": "id:5",
        "$group_set": {
            "company_name": "Awesome Inc",
            "employees": 11
        }
    }
}

```

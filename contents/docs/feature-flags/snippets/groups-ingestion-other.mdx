Not all libraries support group analytics yet, but you can work around this issue by sending events in specific formats.

This section uses our [capture API](/docs/api/capture) for examples but you can adapt this approach to any library.

#### Capturing events with groups

```shell
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "event_name",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "distinct_id_of_your_user",
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        "$groups": {
            "company": "id:5"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Updating group properties

```shell
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "$groupidentify",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "distinct_id_of_your_user",
        "$group_type": "company",
        "$group_key": "id:5",
        "$group_set": {
            "company_name": "Awesome Inc",
            "employees": 11
        }
    }
}
```

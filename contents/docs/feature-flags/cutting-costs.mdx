We aim to be significantly cheaper than our competitors. In addition to our [pay-as-you-go pricing](/pricing), below are tips to reduce your feature flag costs:

## Reduce client-side feature flag requests

In our [JavaScript Web](/docs/libraries/js) and [React Native](/docs/libraries/react-native) SDKs, you can reduce the cost of feature flags by reducing the number of requests your client makes to fetch feature flag values for your users.

1. Using the the [advanced configuration](/docs/libraries/js/config#advanced-configuration), set `advanced_disable_feature_flags_on_first_load` to `true`. This stops automatically requesting feature flags whenever a page loads. This is useful when you're immediately calling `posthog.identify()` anyway, which requests flags again.

2. Using the the [advanced configuration](/docs/libraries/js/config#advanced-configuration), set `advanced_disable_feature_flags` to `true`. This stops PostHog automatically requesting feature flags. Instead, use [bootstrapping](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping) to load flags exactly once.

> **Note:** Use of `advanced_disable_feature_flags` will disable surveys for all users, as surveys rely on feature flags internally.

## Reduce local evaluation costs

If you're using [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation), your bill may be high because of too many requests to fetch feature flag definitions. By default, PostHog fetches these every 30 seconds.

Each request charges 10 credits, so assuming your server is constantly running and making 2 requests per minute (the default setting), this will charge `10 * 2 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 864,000 credits` each month.

You can reduce this by increasing the [feature flag polling interval](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation#step-2-initialize-posthog-with-your-personal-api-key) when initializing PostHog. For example, every 5 minutes instead of every 30 seconds.

The drawback of this approach is that whenever you make an update to a feature flag using the PostHog UI, it takes 5 minutes (instead of 30 seconds) for that change to roll to your server.

> **Note:** Do not use local evaluation in an edge / lambda environment, as this initializes a PostHog instance on every call, which can raise your bill drastically. It's best to use regular flag evaluation instead.

## Quota limiting

Like all PostHog products, you can set a [billing limit](https://us.posthog.com/organization/billing) for feature flags. When a project exceeds this limit, the `/decide` endpoint will return a `quota_limited` response like this:

```json
{
  "quota_limited": true,
  "featureFlags": {}
}
```

In this case, SDKs will:

1. Return the default value for the feature flag, like `false` for `isFeatureEnabled()` and `null` for `getFeatureFlag()`
2. Include a `quota_limited` property in the response
3. Log a warning message if debug mode is enabled

This ensures that your application continues to function even when feature flag quotas are exceeded, falling back to default behavior rather than failing.

## Audit environments to catch hidden `/decide` calls

Forgotten environments, like old demos, test apps, or staging servers, can silently rack up costs. Even if they donâ€™t send many events, they may still be making `/decide` calls for feature flags, session replay, and surveys.

These environments often get overlooked, especially if they're not part of your main deployment flow.

To identify where PostHog is still running:

1. Create a [trends insight](https://us.posthog.com/insights/new#insight=TRENDS)  
2. Choose a high-signal event that occurs across SDKs: like `$feature_flag_called`, `$identify`, or a common custom event  
3. Set the chart type to **Table**  
4. Breakdown by `$lib`, `$lib_version`, and experiment with breakdowns on `$host`, `$device_name`, and `$app_version` as these can clue you into what environments are running PostHog  
5. Set the time range to **Last 30 days**

This shows you every SDK, domain, and version currently making requests, so you can spot any forgotten environments.

If you find environments that don't need feature flags, replays, or surveys, disable them entirely using `advanced_disable_feature_flags`:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  advanced_disable_feature_flags: true // Disables feature flags, surveys, and session recording
})
```

See [advanced configuration options](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/js/config#advanced-configuration) for details.

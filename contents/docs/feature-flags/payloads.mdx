## Payloads

A feature flag payload is an additional piece of information sent along to your app when a flag is matched for a user. The returned value can be any valid JSON type (object, array, number, string, boolean, or null).

For boolean feature flags, you can specify a payload to be returned when the flag is true. For multivariate flags, you can define a payload for each variant of the flag. 

## Use cases

Payloads give you the ability to configure functionality related to your flag inside PostHog. This means more flexibility and fewer updates to your code. For example, you can:
- set the color, size, and text of a button
- modify the title and subtitle of a page
- trigger different functions with different arguments
- access multiple different infrastructure options

Without payloads, all of these options would need to be coded into your app, rather than accessing the payload values. 

## Using payloads in your code

To illustrate how to use feature flag payloads, we can configure a button in JavaScript by first checking for the flag, then setting the config with the payload value.

```js
// payload for 'checkout-button-color' defined as:
// {
//    color: 'black',
//    size: 50
// }

if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('checkout-button-color') === 'black') {
    const buttonConfig = posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload('keyword')
    // do something
}
```

The feature flag payload retrieval function (`getFeatureFlagPayload()`) is a separate function that can be called to obtain the payload associated with the flag.

## Payloads

A feature flag payload is an additional piece of information that is sent along to your app when a flag is matched for a user. The returned value can be any valid JSON type (object, array, number, string, Boolean or null).

For boolean based feature flags, you can specify a payload to be returned when the flag is true. For multviariate flags, you can define a payload for each of the variants of the flag. 

## Use cases

Payloads give you the ability to configure functionality related to your flag right inside PostHog without limits. For example, if you wanted to flag the color and size of a button, you now can specify a payload that provides 
a size value and a color value. Without payloads, you would have to have used the feature flag key as the value that determines the configuration of the button or write in your code a dictionary/switch of options based on the flag values. 

## Using payloads in your code

To illustrate how feature flag payloads can be used, the javascript implementation will be demonstrated.

```js
// payload for 'checkout-button-color' defined as:
// {
//    color: 'black',
//    size: 50
// }

if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('checkout-button-color') === 'black') {
    const buttonConfig = posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload('keyword')
    // do something
}
```

The feature flag payload retrieval function (`getFeatureFlagPayload()`) is a separate function that can be called to obtain the payload associated with the flag.

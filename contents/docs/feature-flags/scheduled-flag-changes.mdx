Scheduling feature flag changes enable you to automatically change flag properties at a future point in time. For example, you can schedule an initial release of a flag for internal testing, then enable it to the beta users group 2 days later, and finally, roll it out to 100% of the users in 2 weeks.

This is also useful if your releases fall outside normal working hours. For example, a ticket sale starting at midnight.

## How to schedule a change:

1. Navigate to the relevant feature flag.
2. Select the `Schedule` tab.
3. Under `Change type`:
    - Select `Change status` if you want to enable or disable your flag at a scheduled time.
    - Select `Add condition` if you want to specify the rollout conditions of your flag at a scheduled time.
4. Select the `Date and time` of your scheduled change using the date picker.
5. Click `Schedule`.

You can view the scheduled changes in the table at the bottom of the page.

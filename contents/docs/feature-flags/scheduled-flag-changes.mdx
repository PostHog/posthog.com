Scheduling feature flag changes allows you to automatically change flag properties at a future point in time. For example, you can schedule an initial release of the flag for internal testing, then enable it to the beta users group 2 days later, and finally roll it out to 100% of the users in 2 weeks.

This is also useful if your releases fall outside normal working hours (for example, a ticket sale starting at midnight).

## How to schedule a change:

Follow these steps to schedule a change to a feature flag:

1. Navigate to the relevant feature flag.
2. Select the `Schedule` tab.
3. Select the `Change type`:
- If you select `Add condition`, specify your new release condition to be added.
- If you select `Change status`, set or unset the `Enabled feature flag` checkbox.
4. Select the `Date and time` of your scheduled change from the date picker.
5. Click `Schedule` and view the newly scheduled change in the table at the bottom.

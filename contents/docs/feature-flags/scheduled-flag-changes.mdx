Scheduling feature flag changes enable you to automatically change flag properties at a future point in time. For example, you can schedule an initial release of a flag for internal testing, then enable it to the beta users group 2 days later, and finally, roll it out to 100% of the users in 2 weeks.

This is also useful if your releases fall outside normal working hours. For example, a ticket sale starting at midnight.

## How to schedule a change:

1. Navigate to the relevant feature flag.
2. Select the `Schedule` tab.
3. Under `Change type`:
    - Select `Change status` if you want to enable or disable your flag at a scheduled time.
    - Select `Add condition` if you want to specify the rollout conditions of your flag at a scheduled time.
    - Select `Update variants` if you want to update the variants keys, descriptions, payloads, or rollouts.
4. Select the `Date and time` of your scheduled change using the date picker.
5. Click `Schedule`.

You can view the scheduled changes in the table at the bottom of the page.

## Copying scheduled changes across projects

When [copying feature flags across projects](/docs/feature-flags/multi-project-feature-flags), you can optionally include pending scheduled changes. This is useful when you want to replicate your entire flag configuration, including future automated changes, to another project.

When copying schedules:

- Only **pending** (unexecuted) scheduled changes are copied
- All schedule properties are preserved, including timing, recurrence, payload, and end dates
- Schedules that have already executed are not copied to avoid duplicating completed actions

To copy schedules, check the "Copy schedules" option in the Projects tab when copying a flag. The checkbox shows the number of pending schedules available to copy.

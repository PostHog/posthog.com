Scheduling feature flag changes allows you to automatically change flag properties at a future point in time. For example, you can schedule an initial release of the flag for internal testing, then enable it to the beta users group 2 days later, and finally roll it out to 100% of the users in 2 weeks.

This is also useful if your releases fall outside normal working hours (for example, a ticket sale starting at midnight).

## How to schedule a change:

Follow these steps to schedule a change to a feature flag:

1. Navigate to the relevant feature flag.
2. Select the `Schedule` tab.
3. Under `Change type`:
  - Select `Change status` if you want to enable or disable your flag at the scheduled time
  - Select `Add condition` if you want to specify the rollout conditions of your flag at the scheduled time
4. Select the `Date and time` of your scheduled change from the date picker.
5. Click `Schedule`

You can view the scheduled changes in the table at the bottom of the page.

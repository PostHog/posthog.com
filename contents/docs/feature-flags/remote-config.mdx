Boolean and multivariate flags are helpful for dynamic values that differ from user to user, but sometimes you need a simple way to pass configuration related to your application without having to make code changes or redeploy your app.

Remote config flags enable you to configure a simple flag that always returns the same payload wherever it is called. Remote config flags can also be stored as encrypted values and decrypted on the server side when requested. Encryption/decryption is handled automatically.

There are 3 steps to start using remote config flags:

## Step 1: Find your feature flags secure API key

import ObtainFeatureFlagsSecureAPIKey from "../integrate/_snippets/obtain-flags-secure-key.mdx"

<ObtainFeatureFlagsSecureAPIKey />

## Step 2: Initialize PostHog with your feature flags secure API key

import ConfigureFlagsSecureKey from "../integrate/_snippets/configure-flags-secure-key.mdx"

<ConfigureFlagsSecureKey />

> **Note:** When you initialize PostHog with your feature flags secure API key to enable remote config, PostHog also enables [local evaluation](./local-evaluation).


## Step 3: Use remote config flags

<MultiLanguage>

```node
const config = posthog.getRemoteConfigPayload('landing-page-config')
// config is a JsonType
```

```python
config = posthog.get_remote_config_payload('landing-page-config')
# config is a JSON encoded string. It will need to be parsed as a JSON object.
```

```go
config, err := posthog.GetRemoteConfigPayload("landing-page-config")
// config is a JSON encoded string. It will need to be parsed as a JSON object.
```

```ruby
config = posthog.get_remote_config_payload('landing-page-config')
# config is a JSON encoded string. It will need to be parsed as a JSON object.
```

```csharp
var config = await posthog.GetRemoteConfigPayloadAsync("landing-page-config");
// config is a JsonDocument
```

</MultiLanguage>

You can think of remote config flags as multivariate flags with a single variant which is served for all flag requests. By default, enabled remote config flags roll out to 100% of all users.

> **Note**: Remote config flags are meant to always serve payloads and be called with the flag payload function in each SDK. If `getFeatureFlag` is called instead, the SDK simply returns `true`

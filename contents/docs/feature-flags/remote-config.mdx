> **Note**: Remote config flags are only available in our JavaScript web, Node, Python, Ruby, and React libraries.

Boolean and multivariate flags are helpful for dynamic values that differ from user to user, but sometimes you need a simple way to pass configuration related to your application without having to make code changes or redeploy your app.

Remote config flags allow you to configure a simple flag that always returns the same payload wherever it is called:

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
const themedLogoUrl = posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload('company-holiday-logo-url')
```


```node
const remoteConfigValue = posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload({
    key: 'current-chat-completion-model',
    distinctId: '_irrelevant_',
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

You can think of remote config flags as multivariate flags with a single variant which will be served for all flag requests. 


> **Note**: Remote config flags are meant to always serve payloads and be called with the flag payload function in each SDK. If `getFeatureFlag` is called instead,
> the SDK will simply return `true`

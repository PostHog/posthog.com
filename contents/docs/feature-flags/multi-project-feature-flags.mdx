Sometimes, you may want to use the same feature flag keys across different PostHog [projects](/docs/data/organizations-and-projects). For example, when you're testing a new feature in staging before releasing to production. In this case, PostHog makes it easy to copy and sync feature flags across projects.

This eliminates the need for manual replication, which is error-prone.

## How to copy or update a feature flag across projects


If the flag with the given key does not exist in the target project, a new flag will be created from scratch. If it already exists, the existing flag in the target project will be fully overwritten with the one from your source project

> **Note:** If you copy a flag linked to a dynamic cohort and the cohort with the same name does not exist in the target project, the entire cohort will be copied over. For a linked static cohort, the cohort will get copied, but it will be empty. This is because the associated persons might not exist in the target project.

Follow these steps to copy or update the flag in another project:

1. Navigate to the feature flag you want to copy.
2. Go to the __Projects__ tab.
3. Choose the project to copy the flag to
4. Click __Copy__ or __Update__ - this depends on whether the flag already exists in the target project.
5. Check the table overview at the bottom to see the newly created or updated flag.

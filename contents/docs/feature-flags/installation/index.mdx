Feature flags enable safer deployment and roll back of new features and code. This helps roll out new features to your users in a managed way. If something goes wrong, flags enable roll backs without having to re-deploy your application.

Feature flags also help you control access to certain parts of your product, such as only showing paid features to users with an active subscription or [early access features](/docs/feature-flags/early-access-feature-management) to users enrolled in a beta.

## Platforms

> **Note:** Feature flags are not yet supported in our community-maintained Rust SDK. Use the [API](/docs/feature-flags/installation/api) instead.

Once you've written your code, it's a good idea to test that each variant behaves as you'd expect. There are 3 ways you can do this:

## Method 1: Assign a user a specific flag value

For boolean flags, you can roll out the flag to a specific user. For multivariate flags, you can assign a user to a specific variant by **adding an optional override** to your [release conditions](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags#release-conditions). 

To do this:

1. Go to your feature flag.
2. Ensure the feature flag is enabled by checking the "Enable feature flag" box.
3. Add a new condition set with the condition to `email = your_email@domain.com`. Set the rollout percentage for this set to 100%.
   
   - in cases where `email` is not available (such as when your users are logged out), you can use a parameter like `utm_source` and append `?utm_source=your_variant_name` to your URL.


4. If it is a multivariant flag, set the optional override to the variant you want to assign these users to.
5. Click "Save".

## Method 2: Use `posthog.featureFlags.override()`

> **Note:** The `posthog.featureFlags.override()` method is only available in the [JavaScript web](/docs/libraries/js) and [React Native](/docs/libraries/react-native) SDKs.

You can add a manual override directly in your code by calling `posthog.featureFlags.override()`:

```javascript
posthog.featureFlags.override({
    'your_boolean_feature_flag_key': true // for boolean feature flags
    'your_multivariate_feature_flag_key': 'your_variant_name', // for multivariate feature flags
})
```

## Method 3: Use the PostHog toolbar

> **Note:** The [PostHog toolbar](/docs/toolbar) is only available for the [JavaScript web SDK](/docs/libraries/js).

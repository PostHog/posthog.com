<FeatureAvailability availability={_frontmatter.availability.features.evaluationEnvironments} />

Evaluation environments provide fine-grained control over where and when your feature flags evaluate. By constraining flag evaluation to specific environments or contexts, you can reduce unnecessary evaluations, optimize costs, and better organize your feature management strategy.

## What are evaluation environments?

Evaluation environments are constraints that determine when a feature flag should be evaluated. They're configured in the PostHog UI by tagging your flags and marking those tags as "evaluation environment tags" (with the bolt icon ⚡). Unlike standard tags (which are purely organizational), evaluation environment tags actively filter which flags are returned during evaluation requests.

When you configure evaluation environment tags on a feature flag:
- The flag will **only** evaluate when the SDK provides matching environments via `evaluation_environments`
- Flags without evaluation environment tags continue to work as before (evaluating for all requests)
- At least one environment must match for the flag to be included

## Why use evaluation environments?

### 1. Application isolation

Prevent feature flags from accidentally affecting the wrong application or context. For example:
- Marketing site flags won't affect your main application
- Documentation site flags won't impact your mobile apps
- Admin panel flags won't evaluate in customer-facing features

### 2. Cost optimization

Reduce unnecessary flag evaluations and associated costs by:
- Only evaluating relevant flags per application context
- Reducing network payload sizes
- Minimizing server-side processing

### 3. Better organization

Group and filter flags by their intended application context in the feature flags UI, for example:
- Application type (e.g., "main-app", "marketing-site", "docs")
- Platform (e.g., "web", "mobile", "api")
- Product area (e.g., "checkout", "onboarding", "admin")

### 4. Improved performance

Smaller, more focused flag sets mean:
- Faster evaluation times
- Reduced memory usage in SDKs

## Setting up evaluation environments

### Step 1: Apply evaluation environments to flags in the UI

When creating or editing a feature flag:

1. Navigate to the tags section
2. Add tags that represent your application contexts (e.g., "main-app", "marketing-site", "docs", "mobile")
3. Click the bolt icon <IconBolt className="inline w-4 h-4" /> to mark these tags as evaluation constraints
4. Selected evaluation environment tags will display with a green background and bolt icon

> **Remember:** Setting evaluation environment tags in the PostHog app is only half the setup. Your application needs to declare its environment via the SDK configuration (Step 2).

### Step 2: Configure your SDKs

**This step is essential** - After marking tags as evaluation constraints in the PostHog app, you must update your SDK configuration to declare which application contexts your application represents. The SDK's `evaluation_environments` parameter must match the tags you've marked in the UI.

Update your SDK initialization to include evaluation environments:

<MultiLanguage>

```js-web
posthog.init('YOUR_API_KEY', {
    api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'web', 'checkout']
})
```

```node
const posthog = new PostHog('YOUR_API_KEY', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'api', 'backend']
})
```

```python
posthog = Posthog(
    'YOUR_API_KEY',
    host='https://app.posthog.com',
    evaluation_environments=['main-app', 'api', 'backend']
)
```

```react
<PostHogProvider 
    apiKey='YOUR_API_KEY'
    options={{
        api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
        evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'web', 'app']
    }}
>
    <App />
</PostHogProvider>
```

```react-native
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

const posthogAsync = PostHog.initAsync('YOUR_API_KEY', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    evaluationEnvironments: ['main-app', 'mobile', 'app']
})
```

```android
val config = PostHogConfig(
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY",
    host = "https://app.posthog.com"
).apply {
    evaluationEnvironments = listOf("main-app", "android", "mobile")
}
PostHogAndroid.setup(context, config)
```

```ios
let config = PostHogConfig(
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    host: "https://app.posthog.com"
)
config.evaluationEnvironments = ["main-app", "ios", "mobile"]
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
```

```ruby
posthog = PostHog::Client.new({
    api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'api', 'backend']
})
```

```go
client, _ := posthog.NewWithConfig("YOUR_API_KEY", posthog.Config{
    Endpoint: "https://app.posthog.com",
    EvaluationEnvironments: []string{"main-app", "api", "backend"},
})
```

```php
PostHog::init('YOUR_API_KEY', [
    'host' => 'https://app.posthog.com',
    'evaluation_environments' => ['main-app', 'api', 'backend']
]);
```

```java
PostHog posthog = new PostHog.Builder("YOUR_API_KEY")
    .host("https://app.posthog.com")
    .evaluationEnvironments(Arrays.asList("main-app", "api", "backend"))
    .build();
```

</MultiLanguage>

## How evaluation works

When a flag evaluation request is made:

1. **SDK sends application contexts**: The SDK includes its configured `evaluation_environments` in the request
2. **PostHog filters flags**: Only flags matching these criteria are evaluated:
   - Flags with no evaluation environment tags (backward compatibility)
   - Flags with empty evaluation environment tags
   - Flags where at least one evaluation tag matches the SDK's declared application contexts
3. **Results returned**: Only the filtered flags are returned to the SDK

### Example scenario

Consider these feature flags (with their evaluation environment tags in the UI):
- Flag A: No evaluation environment tags → Evaluates for all requests
- Flag B: Evaluation environment tags `["main-app", "web"]` → Only evaluates when SDK declares "main-app" OR "web"
- Flag C: Evaluation environment tags `["marketing-site"]` → Only evaluates when SDK declares "marketing-site"

If an SDK is configured with `evaluation_environments: ["main-app", "mobile"]`:
- ✅ Flag A evaluates (no constraints)
- ✅ Flag B evaluates ("main-app" matches)
- ❌ Flag C does NOT evaluate (no matching application contexts)

## Best practices

### Start simple
Begin with high-level application distinctions:
- `main-app` vs. `marketing-site` vs. `docs`
- `web` vs. `mobile` vs. `api`

### Use consistent naming
Establish a naming convention for your evaluation environment tags:
- Application: `main-app`, `marketing-site`, `docs`, `admin-panel`
- Platform: `web`, `ios`, `android`, `api`
- Product area: `checkout`, `onboarding`, `billing`

### Document your application contexts

Maintain a list of standard application context names and their purposes to ensure consistent usage across teams.

### Gradual adoption

You don't need to add evaluation environment tags to all flags at once. Start with new flags or high-traffic flags where the benefits are most significant.

### Monitor impact

Track the reduction in flag evaluations and associated cost savings after implementing evaluation environments.

## Differences from evaluation runtime

While both features control where flags evaluate, they serve different purposes:

| Feature | Evaluation Environments | Evaluation Runtime |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Fine-grained application context constraints | SDK type filtering |
| **Control** | User-defined tags in UI | Predefined options (client/server/all) |
| **Granularity** | Unlimited custom contexts | Three fixed options |
| **Configuration** | Tags marked as evaluation constraints | Per-flag setting |
| **SDK parameter** | `evaluation_environments` | Automatic based on SDK type |
| **Use case** | Application isolation, cost optimization | Client vs. server separation |

For practical examples of using both features together, see [How to use evaluation runtimes and environments together](/tutorials/evaluation-runtimes-and-environments).

## Common use cases

### Multi-application organizations

If you have multiple applications sharing a PostHog instance:
```javascript
// Marketing site
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['marketing-site', 'web'] })

// Main app
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'web'] })

// Documentation
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['docs', 'web'] })
```

### Platform-specific features

Separate features by platform while maintaining a single flag source:
```javascript
// iOS app
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'ios'] })

// Android app
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'android'] })

// Web app
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'web'] })
```

### Product area isolation

Separate features by product area within your main application:
```javascript
// Checkout flow
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'checkout'] })

// Onboarding flow
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['main-app', 'onboarding'] })

// Admin panel
posthog.init('KEY', { evaluation_environments: ['admin-panel', 'web'] })
```

## Troubleshooting

### Flags not evaluating

If a flag with evaluation environment tags isn't evaluating:
1. **Check that your SDK is configured with `evaluation_environments`** - This is the most common issue. Your application must explicitly declare its application contexts.
2. Verify at least one evaluation tag in the UI matches your SDK's `evaluation_environments`
3. Ensure the tags are properly marked as evaluation constraints (bolt icon) in PostHog
4. Confirm you've deployed the SDK configuration changes to your application

### All flags evaluating

If you're still seeing all flags despite using evaluation environments:
1. Confirm your SDK version supports evaluation environments
2. Check that flags have tags marked as evaluation constraints (bolt icon, not just regular tags)
3. Verify your SDK is sending the `evaluation_environments` parameter

### Performance not improved

If you don't see performance improvements:
1. Ensure you've added evaluation environment tags to high-traffic flags
2. Check that your application contexts are specific enough to filter effectively
3. Monitor the reduction in evaluated flags using PostHog analytics

## Migration guide

To adopt evaluation environments in an existing PostHog setup:

1. **Audit current flags**: Identify which flags are used in which application contexts
2. **Define tag taxonomy**: Create a consistent naming scheme for your application contexts
3. **Configure tags**: Mark appropriate tags as evaluation constraints
4. **Update high-impact flags first**: Start with flags that have the most evaluations
5. **Update SDKs gradually**: Roll out [SDK changes](/docs/sdk-doctor) with `evaluation_environments` per environment
6. **Monitor and adjust**: Track the impact and refine your tag strategy

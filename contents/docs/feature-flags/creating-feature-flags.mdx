To create a new feature flag, navigate to the [feature flags tab](https://app.posthog.com/feature_flags) in your PostHog app, where you should see a 'Create feature flag' button that we'll click.

This presents you with a form where you can complete the details of your new flag:

Here's a breakdown of each field in the form:

### Key

This is the name of the key you use in your code to evaluate the feature flag.

### Description and tags 

Metadata to describe and share information about your feature flag in the PostHog app.

### Enable feature flag

This determines whether your flag is enabled. Disabled flags return `undefined` or `null`.

### Persisting feature flags across authentication steps

> This is only relevant if your feature flag is shown to both logged out AND logged in users.

Feature flag values are calculated based on a user's properties. Since it's possible for a user to have different properties before and after login, they may receive different feature flag values before and after logging in.

By enabling the option to persist feature flags across authentication, you ensure that the flag value remains the same. 

There are trade-offs to enabling this:

1. It slows down the feature flag response.
2. It disables [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) of the feature flag.
3. It disables [bootstrapping](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping) the feature flag.

### Served value

There are two types of feature flags:

#### 1. Boolean flags. 

These return `true` or `false`.

#### 2. Multiple variant flags (multivariate flags). 

Instead of returning true or false, multivariate flags return a key – for example, `control` or `test`. 

You can choose the rollout percentage for each variant key, where each is given a specific percentage of the total audience. Users will then be randomly assigned to each variant based on these percentages.

### Payloads

A payload is an additional piece of information sent to your app when a flag is matched for a user. The returned value can be any valid JSON type (object, array, number, string, boolean, or null).

They enable you to configure functionality related to your flag inside PostHog, instead of having to make code changes or redeploy your app.

> **Note**: Payloads are only available in our JavaScript web, Node, Python, Ruby, and React libraries.

### Release conditions

This specifies the conditions a user must meet to access the feature flag and receive a value.

You can create conditions based on [user properties](/docs/product-analytics/user-properties), [group properties](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics#how-to-set-group-properties), or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts).

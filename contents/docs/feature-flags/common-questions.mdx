title: Common questions about feature flags

## Why is my feature flag not working?

Here's a list of suggestions to troubleshoot your flag:

1. Check the feature flags tab on [the persons page](https://app.posthog.com/persons) for your specific person.
    1. If the flag is showing up as disabled here, check the "match evaluation" column to know the reason why.
    2. If the flag is showing up as enabled here, the problem lies somewhere in the implementation (your code).
2. Check if you're calling `identify()` before the flag is called to get to the right person on your website.
3. Check if an ad-blocker is blocking calls. If yes, you can fix this by [deploying a reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy).
4. If your flag depends on person properties, and doesn't work for initially anonymous users, you might be hitting the case where flags are being queried before those properties can be ingested. In this case, manually pass in properties to `getFeatureFlag` from your client.
5. [Raise a support ticket](https://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal) to see if we can help debug.

## Why are local evaluation flags priced differently?

[Local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping-and-local-evaluation) enables you to pull flag definitions from the PostHog API, rather than making an individual `decide` call per flag. Using these definitions, you can resolve the flags of hundreds or thousands of users with a single API call. We therefore bill a single local evaluation call as being equivalent to 10 `decide`requests.

Local evaluation payloads are typically used for much, _much_ more than 10 users, so local evaluation is often still more cost-effective than making individual `decide` requests. We also give all users their first 1M API calls (or 100k local evaluation calls) free each month, in addition to offering discounts for non-profit organizations and [startups](/startups).

## My feature flags are too expensive, what can I do about this?

Feature flags can get expensive if your code ends up sending multiple requests to get feature flags for each person.

If this is happening on the client side, i.e. while using the posthog-js SDK, you have two options:

1. As per the [advanced configuration](/docs/libraries/js#advanced-configuration), set the `advanced_disable_feature_flags_on_first_load` setting. This stops automatically requesting feature flags whenever a page loads. This is useful when you're immediately calling `posthog.identify()` anyway, which requests flags again.
2. As per the [advanced configuration](/docs/libraries/js#advanced-configuration), set the `advanced_disable_feature_flags` setting. This stops automatically requesting feature flags. Instead, use the [bootstrap option](/docs/libraries/js#bootstrapping-flags) to load flags only once, via local evaluation, which makes no requests for flags from the client side.

Instead, if your bill is high because of too many local evaluation requests, here's how to fix it:

When you use local evaluation, you aren't charged for evaluating flags per user (as long as you only evaluate locally), but for requests for flag definitions. Every PostHog instance you initialise creates a poller that sends requests to us every 30 seconds by default.

So, for example, if you have 25 backend servers, and each of those has a `pollInterval` of 30 seconds, the total number of requests per minute you're charged for is 25*2 = 50 requests / minute. In other words, that is 50*60*24*30 =~ 2 million requests / month.

To fix this, you can set the `pollInterval`, or the equivalent parameter in your SDK of choice to 300 seconds instead of 30 seconds. The ramifications here are that whenever you make an update to a feature flag using the posthog UI, it will take 300 seconds, instead of 30 seconds for that change to roll to all your servers.

> **Note:** Do not use local evaluation in an edge / lambda environment, because this initialises a posthog instance on every call, which can raise your bill drastically. It's best to use regular flag evaluation here.

## On my website, why does the feature flag sometimes flicker?

By default, flags are loaded from our servers which takes about 100-500ms. During this time, the flag is disabled, which can be the reason why you see things look differently for the first 500ms.

To fix this, you can [bootstrap feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping-and-local-evaluation).

---

## I care about latency a lot, and 500ms delays are unacceptable on my servers. Can I do something about this?

Yes, use [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping-and-local-evaluation#server-side-local-evaluation). This downloads flag definitions on your servers and evaluates them locally.

---

## My feature flags are sending a lot of events, how can I manage this?

Every library has the option to disable sending these events. Just check the relevant docs for the library for the `send_events` parameter in your `posthog.isFeatureEnabled()` or `posthog.getFeatureFlag()` calls.

However, note that this has a few consequences:

1. The usage tab on the flag will stop showing events since we can't track them anymore.
2. Experiments that depend on trend goals won't work since we use this event to calculate relative exposure. Convert your trend experiments to funnel experiments instead to make this work.

## Is the rollout percentage for a flag deterministic? How about multiple flags?

For any given feature flag, a user who is within the rollout bound will always remain within the rollout bound as the rollout percentage increases. Thus, the rollout percentage is deterministic.
With multiple feature flags, users can fall under different points of rollout percentages per flag, so for a "50% rollout" for feature flag A and feature flag B, you won't always have the same users that see both features at once.

---

## Why can't I use a cohort with behavioral filters in my feature flag?

Feature flags require fast evaluation and behavioral or lifecycle queries are relatively slow. This slowness isn't a big deal for cohorts, but is for feature flags. Enabling these queries would significantly impact the entire feature flag service. 

Feature flags can quickly access person properties cohorts or a static list of user IDs, which is why cohorts based on those can be used.

To get around this, you can create a dynamic behavioral cohort and then duplicate it as a static cohort (using the button on the cohort's detail page).

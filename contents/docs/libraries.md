PostHog provides multiple libraries to send events from your app to your PostHog instance.

We have put a significant effort into providing as many of these libraries as possible, in order to make your experience better.

Our goal is for users to be able to integrate PostHog with their language and framework of choosing, without having to adapt their stack.

## Autocapture

All of our libraries are similar, except for the JavaScript library which has [event autocapture](/docs/features/events#autocapture-event-tracking).

They can all be used to send custom events, update user properties, identify users, as well as provide support for various other PostHog features.

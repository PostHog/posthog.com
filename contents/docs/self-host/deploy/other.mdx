> Note: This deployment option is in Beta. See alternative deployment options [here](/docs/self-host#deployment-options).

For all the other platforms, setup your Kubernetes cluster (see the documentation of your platform for more info). Note that many platforms default to non-expandable volumes.

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql), [DigitalOcean managed databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/), [Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)

## Installing the chart

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: <your-deployment-platform>
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

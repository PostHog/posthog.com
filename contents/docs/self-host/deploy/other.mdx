For all the other platforms, setup your Kubernetes cluster (see the documentation of your platform for more info). Note that many platforms default to non-expandable volumes.

## Installing the chart

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: <your-deployment-platform>
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
kafka:
  persistence:
    size: 20Gi
```

## Lookup external IP

```shell
kubectl get svc --namespace posthog posthog-ingress-nginx-controller
```

## Setting up DNS

Create a record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

## Troubleshooting
### I cannot connect to my PostHog instance after creation

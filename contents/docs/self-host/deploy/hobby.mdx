<Disclaimer />

We provide a PostHog "hobby deployment" option for those that want to try out self-hosted PostHog without having to spend a lot on infrastructure costs.

It should **not** be used as a production instance for tracking a product with any reasonable amount of scale.

## Requirements

- You have deployed a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine.
    - An instance with 2GB of RAM can handle approximately 100k events spread over a month
    - We highly recommend an instance with at least 4GB of RAM to handle any surges in event volume
    - For volumes over 100K a month we'd recommend deploying using [Kubernetes](/docs/self-host/deploy/other)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed

Not sure where to host? You can click on the badge below to get US$100 in credit for DigitalOcean (i.e. run PostHog for free for ~2 months).

## Setting up `docker-compose.yml`

To get started, we'll run the `deploy-hobby` script from the PostHog repo, which will download and set up our `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

## Setting up SSL _(optional)_

Next, we'll set up SSL for our deployment through LetsEncrypt. This step is optional, but we'd _highly_ recommend it if you're deploying PostHog in production.

Before proceeding, make sure you have configured your DNS settings to point your domain to your new instance.
It may take a couple mintues before these changes propagate, so make sure to double check the status before moving forward.

>**Tip:** Avoid using the word 'posthog' in your domain to prevent requests being blocked by ad blockers.

Once your DNS record is set up, we'll need to make a few small changes to our config.

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, change the value of `SITE_URL` from `http://localhost` to `https://<your-domain>`.

```yaml file=docker-compose.yml
services:
    ...
    web:
        ...
        environment: &env
            DEPLOYMENT: hobby
            # replace with your domain
            SITE_URL: https://<your-domain>
            DISABLE_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT: 'true'

```

Next, we'll add the domain to the Caddyfile.

```yaml file=Caddyfile
# replace with your domain
<your-domain> {
  reverse_proxy http://web:8000
}
```

>**Note:** Make sure not to prepend `https://` before your domain in this file.

We're now all set! Once we spin up the stack, we'll get an automatic SSL certificate through LetsEncrypt.

### Customizing your deployment (optional)

By default, the `docker-compose.yml` file comes with a series of default config values that should work for most deployments.
If you need to customize anything, you can take a look at the [full list of environment variables here](/docs/self-host/configure/environment-variables).

Additionally, if you would like to run a different version of PostHog, you can change the tag for the web, worker, and plugins services.
Check out [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/posthog/posthog) for a list of all available tags.

## Run the PostHog stack

Now, all that's left to do is to spin up all our services!

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

We can use `docker ps` to check that all of our services are running.

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                               COMMAND     CREATED    STATUS    PORTS   NAMES

ff42ccf14481   redis:6.2.7-alpine                  ...         1m ago     Up 1m     ...     ...
402a0eef69ae   postgres:12-alpine                  ...         1m ago     Up 1m     ...     ...

```

At this point, it will still take a couple of minutes for all the migrations to settle and for Caddy to set up our CA certificate.
To check the progress of these migrations, we can take a look at the logs for the web container.

```bash
docker logs posthog_web_1
```

> **Note:** Make sure to replace `posthog_web_1` with the name of your web container when running `docker ps`.

Once everything has settled, you should see the following message in the logs.

```bash
$ docker logs posthog_web_1

```

You can now open the IP address of your instance or the domain you configured earlier in your browser, and you should see the PostHog web interface!

## Upgrading

To upgrade, you can run the `upgrade-hobby` script from the PostHog repo.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/upgrade-hobby)"
```

>**Warning:** Before upgrading, make sure you have created back-ups of all your data!

## Migrating

If you need to move into production or if your server is struggling, you can migrate to a production instance as follows:

-   to [PostHog Cloud](/docs/migrate/migrate-between-cloud-and-self-hosted) for hands-off experience
-   to [a bigger self-hosted instance](/docs/migrate/migrate-to-another-self-hosted-instance)

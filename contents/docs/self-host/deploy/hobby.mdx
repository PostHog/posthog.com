We provide a PostHog "hobby deployment" option for those that want to try out self-hosted PostHog without having to spend a lot on infrastructure costs.

This type of deployment is aimed at users who want to test out the platform or do some minimal tracking (e.g. for a personal blog, or to test PostHog as simply as possible with low volumes).

It should **not** be used as a production instance for tracking a product with any reasonable amount of scale.

## Pre-requisites

* You have deployed a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine. 
  *  A $10/month (2GB RAM) droplet on Digital Ocean can handle approximately 100k events spread over a month
  * We recommend a $20/ month (4GB RAM) if you expect any surges in event volumes
  * Over 100K we'd recommend our Scale deployment methods

You can click on the badge below to get US$100 in credit over 60 days
(i.e. run PostHog for free for ~2 months).

## Quick install on an Ubuntu VM

For a quick install that uses Docker, run the following command:

```bash 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)" 
``` 

## Migrating

If you need to move into production or if your server is struggling, you can migrate to a production instance as follows:

* [deploy a fresh production instance](../) of PostHog
* install the [Migrator 3000 plugin](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-plugin-migrator3000) to migrate your data over

We provide a PostHog "hobby deployment" option for those that want to try out self-hosted PostHog without having to spend a lot on infrastructure costs.

This type of deployment is aimed at users who want to test out the platform or do some minimal tracking (e.g. for a personal blog, or to test PostHog as simply as possible with low volumes).

It should **not** be used as a production instance for tracking a product with any reasonable amount of scale.

## Pre-requisites

-   You have deployed a Linux Ubuntu Virtual Machine.
    -   A $10/month (2GB RAM) droplet on Digital Ocean can handle approximately 100k events spread over a month
    -   We recommend a $20/ month (4GB RAM) if you expect any surges in event volumes
    -   Over 100K we'd recommend our Scale deployment methods

You can click on the badge below to get US$100 in credit over 60 days
(i.e. run PostHog for free for ~2 months).

## Quick install on an Ubuntu VM

For a quick install that uses Docker, run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

## Migrating

If you need to move into production or if your server is struggling, you can migrate to a production instance as follows:

- to [PostHog Cloud](/docs/self-host/migrate-to-cloud) for hands-off experience
- to [a bigger self-hosted instance](/docs/self-host/migrate/migrate-to-another-self-hosted-instance)

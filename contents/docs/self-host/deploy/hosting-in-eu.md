For most EU customers, the [EU version](/eu) of Posthog Cloud enables you to quickly get started quickly and compliantly. The servers are hosted on AWS in the `eu-central-1` region based in Frankfurt, Germany.

However, for some EU users with stringent data control requirements using a US-based cloud hosting company (such as AWS) might not be appropriate, even if the servers are physically located within the EU. This list of providers is a good place to start if you fall into this camp. The following are all EU-based cloud companies that you could self-host PostHog on.

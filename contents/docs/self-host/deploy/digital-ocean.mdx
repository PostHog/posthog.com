## Why Digital Ocean

[Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) is one of the most well-established Cloud Providers. Compared to AWS, where the amount of options and configuration can be overwhelming, Digital Ocean is generally simpler to use and faster to get running.

The first thing you'll need is a get a Digital Ocean account. You can click on the badge below to get $100 in credit over 60 days (i.e. run PostHog for free for 2 months).

You can then either follow the [1-click install](#1-click-install) or the [manual install](#manual-install).

## 1-click install

### Marketplace UI
There is a [1-click option to deploy PostHog](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/posthog-1) on DigitalOcean Marketplace UI.

If you don't already have a cluster setup you should follow the getting started guide to setup kubeconfig. The minimal suggested cluster capacity is using **two of the smallest production nodes**.

You will also need to secure your PostHog deployment.

### CLI
Alternatively use [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) which also sets up kubeconfig for you.

```console
doctl kubernetes cluster create posthog-cluster --count=2 --size="s-2vcpu-4gb" --region=sfo3 --1-clicks=posthog
```

### Accessing PostHog

After deploying PostHog to your Kubernetes cluster you can get the IP to connect to one of two ways:

<DOIPAddressSnippet />

Congrats, you have a working PostHog instance =)

You can now [integrate your development applications](/docs/integrate) with your PostHog deployment for testing purposes.

> Note: You will only be able to test web apps on HTTP such as those running on `localhost`.

But there's one more important step before using it in production: making sure the data is not at risk, see the next section.

### Securing your 1-click install

It's [not yet possible to provide parameters to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-kubernetes/issues/230), so we need a post-install step to enable TLS.

> In order to do this you will need [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and [helm](https://helm.sh/) installed.

#### 1. Lookup external IP

As above, you can get the IP to connect to one of two ways:

<DOIPAddressSnippet />

#### 2. Set up DNS

Create an `A` record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

#### 3. Update PostHog

Create `values.yaml`:

```yaml
cloud: "do"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
certManager:
  enabled: true
```

Run the upgrade (note that if you used the UI for install, you'll need to follow the getting started guide to setup kubeconfig, if you skipped it earlier use the "Remind me how to do this" link on the Kubernetes cluster tab)

```
helm repo add posthog https://posthog.github.io/charts-clickhouse/
helm repo update
helm upgrade -f values.yaml --timeout 20m --namespace posthog posthog posthog/posthog
```

## Manual install

Alternatively, to install the chart manually using [Helm >= v3](https://helm.sh/) follow these steps:

### 1. Set up K8s cluster
  
First, we need to set up a Kubernetes Cluster. See [Kubernetes quickstart](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/quickstart/). Note that the minimum total resource requirements to run PostHog are 4vcpu and 4G of memory. 

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "do"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
certManager:
  enabled: true
```

### 2. Install the chart

<InstallingSnippet />

### 3. Lookup external IP

<DOIPAddressSnippet />

### 4. Set up DNS

Create an `A` record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

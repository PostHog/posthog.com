[Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) is one of the most well-established Cloud Providers.
Compared to AWS, GCP and Azure where the amount of options and configuration can be overwhelming,
Digital Ocean is generally simpler to use and faster to get running.

The first thing you'll need is a get a Digital Ocean account. You can click on the badge below to
get US$100 in credit over 60 days (i.e. run PostHog for free for ~2 months).

  </a>

Then you can either follow the [1-click install](#1-click-install) or the [manual install](#manual-install).


## 1-click install

There is a [1-click install](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/posthog-1) option to deploy PostHog via the
[DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/). The DigitalOcean UI will ask you if you want to
install PostHog on an already provisioned Kubernetes cluster or if you want to create a new one.

Otherwise if you have [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) already configured you can simply run (this will also configure your `kubectl` access):

```shell
doctl kubernetes cluster create \
  posthog-cluster \
  --count=2 \
  --size="s-2vcpu-4gb" \
  --1-clicks=posthog
```

Once the setup is completed, you can pick one of those two methods to fetch the URL of your fresh new PostHog installation:

<DOIPAddress />

> Note: before using PostHog in production remember to [secure your 1-click installation](#securing-your-1-click-install).

> Note: Without securing your instance you will only be able to test web apps on HTTP such as those running on `localhost`.

### Securing your 1-click install

It's unfortunately [not yet possible to provide parameters to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-kubernetes/issues/230), so we need a post-install step to enable TLS. In order to do this you will need [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed and have [configured your `kubectl` access](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/connect-to-cluster/).

#### 1. Update PostHog

Create a `values.yaml` file in the current directory with the following content:

```yaml
cloud: "do"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

Note: if you are planning to use our [GeoIP integration](https://posthog.com/integrations/geoip), please also add the snippet below
to enable proxy protocol support in the load balancer and in the `nginx` ingress controller:

```yaml
#
# For DigitalOcean LB (TCP) mode, we need to enable some additional config
# in the ingress controller in order to get the proper IP address forwarded
# to our app. Otherwise we'll get the load balancer nodes addresses instead.
#
# ref:
#   - https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/miscellaneous/#source-ip-address
#   - https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/load-balancers/
#
#
# Additionally we'll also enable pod communication through the Load Balancer
# to ensure Let's Encrypt can reach the cert-manager Pod validating our domain.
#
# ref:
#   - https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/3996
#   - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-on-digitalocean-kubernetes#step-5-%E2%80%94-enabling-pod-communication-through-the-load-balancer-optional
#
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    config:
      use-proxy-protocol: true
    service:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-hostname: <your-hostname>
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-enable-proxy-protocol: "true"
```

and then run:

<CommandHelmGetRepoSnippet />
<CommandHelmUpgradeSnippet />

#### 2. Install `ClusterIssuer`
<InstallClusterIssuer />

#### 3. Lookup the address of the installation

<GetInstallationAddress />

#### 4. Setting up DNS

<SetupDNS />

## Manual install

First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official DigitalOcean [documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/quickstart/) for more info).

<ClusterRequirementsSnippet />

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [DigitalOcean managed databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)
>

#### 1. Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "do"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

Note: if you are planning to use our [GeoIP integration](https://posthog.com/integrations/geoip), please also add the snippet below
to enable proxy protocol support in the load balancer and in the `nginx` ingress controller:
```
#
# For DigitalOcean LB (TCP) mode, we need to enable some additional config
# in the ingress controller in order to get the proper IP address forwarded
# to our app. Otherwise we'll get the load balancer nodes addresses instead.

#
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    config:
      use-proxy-protocol: true
    service:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-hostname: <your-hostname>
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-enable-proxy-protocol: "true"
```

#### 2. Install the chart

<InstallingSnippet />

#### 3. Lookup the address of the installation

<GetIPAddressSnippet />

Note: due to a limitation in the DigitalOcean ingress controller, the second method will not work if you have enabled the settings to support the GeoIP integration.
Please use the web UI to get your IP address.

#### 4. Setting up DNS

<SetupDNS />

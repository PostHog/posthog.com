[Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) is one of the most well-established Cloud Providers. Compared to AWS, GCP and Azure where the amount of options and configuration can be overwhelming, Digital Ocean is generally simpler to use and faster to get running.

The first thing you'll need is a get a Digital Ocean account. You can click on the badge above to get US$100 in credit over 60 days (i.e. run PostHog for free for ~2 months).

Then you can either follow the [1-click install](#1-click-install) or the [manual install](#manual-install).


## 1-click install

There is a [1-click install](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/posthog-1) option to deploy PostHog via the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/).
The DigitalOcean UI will ask you if you want to install PostHog on an already provisioned Kubernetes cluster or if you want to create a new one.

Once the setup is completed, you can pick one of those two methods to fetch the URL of your fresh new PostHog installation:

<DOIPAddress />

> Note: before using PostHog in production remember to [secure your 1-click installation](#securing-your-1-click-install).

> Note: Without securing your instance you will only be able to test web apps on HTTP such as those running on `localhost`.

<HiddenSection headingType='h3' title='1-click install is also available via doctl'>

If you have [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) configured you can simply run:

```shell
doctl kubernetes cluster create posthog-cluster --count=2 --size="s-2vcpu-4gb" --region=sfo3 --1-clicks=posthog
```

This will also configure your `kubectl` access.

</HiddenSection>


### Securing your 1-click install

It's unfortunately [not yet possible to provide parameters to DigitalOcean](https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-kubernetes/issues/230), so we need a post-install step to enable TLS. In order to do this you will need [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed and have [configured your `kubectl` access](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/how-to/connect-to-cluster/).

#### 1. Lookup the IP address of the installation

<GetIPAddressSnippet />

#### 2. Set up DNS

Create an `A` record from your desired hostname to the external IP we got above.

#### 3. Update PostHog

Create a `values.yaml` file in the current directory with the following content:

```yaml
cloud: "do"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

and then run:

<CommandHelmGetRepoSnippet />
<CommandHelmUpgradeSnippet />

#### 4. Install `ClusterIssuer`
<InstallClusterIssuer />

<PostInstallSnippet />

## Manual install

First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official DigitalOcean [documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/quickstart/) for more info).

<ClusterRequirementsSnippet />

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [DigitalOcean managed databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)
>

#### 1. Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "do"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

#### 2. Install the chart

<InstallingSnippet />

#### 3. Lookup the IP address of our installation

<GetIPAddressSnippet />

#### 4. Set up DNS

Create an `A` record from your desired hostname to the external IP we got above.

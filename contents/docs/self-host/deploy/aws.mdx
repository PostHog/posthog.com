> Note: when choosing to self-host you'll be managing the service yourself, which means running regular upgrades, scaling as needed etc. If you're looking for a more hands-off experience we recommend checking out [PostHog Cloud](/docs/cloud).

First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) for more info). Follow the "Managed nodes - Linux" guide.

<ClusterRequirementsSnippet />

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [AWS MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) and [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [AWS ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis) and [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)
>

## Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [chart configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "aws"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

Note: if you are planning to use our [GeoIP integration](https://posthog.com/integrations/geoip), please also add the snippet below
to enable proxy protocol support in the load balancer and in the `nginx` ingress controller:
```
#
# For AWS ELB in L4 (TCP) mode, we need to enable some additional config
# in the ingress controller in order to get the proper IP address forwarded
# to our app. Otherwise we'll get the load balancer nodes addresses instead.

#   - https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/miscellaneous/#source-ip-address
#   - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-proxy-protocol.html
#
ingress-nginx:
  controller:
    config:
      use-proxy-protocol: true
    service:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol: "*"
```

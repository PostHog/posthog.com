First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) for more info). Follow the "Managed nodes - Linux" guide.

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [AWS MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/msk/) and [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [AWS ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis) and [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)
>

## Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [chart configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "aws"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```


## Installing the chart

### Lookup external IP address

```shell
kubectl get svc --namespace posthog posthog-ingress-nginx-controller
```

### Setting up DNS

Create a `CNAME` record from your desired hostname to the hostname associated with the AWS LB.

## Troubleshooting

### I cannot connect to my PostHog instance after creation

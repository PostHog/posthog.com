> Note: This deployment option is in Beta. See alternative deployment options [here](/docs/self-host#deployment-options).

First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official Azure [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal#create-an-aks-cluster) for more info).

<ClusterRequirementsSnippet />

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [Apache Kafka in Azure HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction) and [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/) and [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)

## Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [chart configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "azure"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
```

First, we need to set up a Kubernetes Cluster, see [Creation with Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal#create-an-aks-cluster). Make sure your cluster has enough resources to run PostHog (total minimum 4 vcpu & 8GiB RAM).

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [chart configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "azure"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
  nginx:
    enabled: true
certManager:
  enabled: true
```

### Installing the chart

### Lookup external IP

```console
kubectl get svc --namespace posthog posthog-ingress-nginx-controller
```
### Setting up DNS

Create a record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

## Troubleshooting
### I cannot connect to my PostHog instance after creation

## Troubleshooting

### helm install failed

##### Not enough resources

You might see one of these errors from `helm install`:
```
Error: failed post-install: timed out waiting for the condition
Error: failed pre-install: timed out waiting for the condition
```
One of the potential causes is that we couldn't find enough resources to schedule all the services Posthog needs to run. To know if resources are a problem we can check pod status and errors while the `helm install` command is still running:
1. check the output for `kubectl get pods -n posthog` and if you see any pending pods for a long time then that could be the problem
2. check if the pending pod has scheduling errors using `kubectl describe pod <podname> -n posthog`. For example, at the end of the events section we could see that we didn't have enough memory to schedule the pod.
```
Events:

```

**How to fix this**: try installing on a bigger Kubernetes cluster.

### Connection is not secure

First, check that DNS is set up properly:
```console
nslookup <your-hostname> 1.1.1.1
```
Note that when using a browser there are various layers of caching and other logic that could make the resolution work (temporarily) even if its not correctly set up.
  
## FAQ
  
### How can I increase storage size?
  
Change the value (e.g. `clickhouseOperator.storage`) and run a `helm upgrade`, which works seamlessly on AWS, GCP and DigitalOcean.

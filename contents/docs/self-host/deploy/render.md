## Why Render

> This deployment method and its documentation are a community contribution. Thank you [@jakemalachowski](https://github.com/jakemalachowski)!

You can use Render's one-click deploy button to get PostHog up and running quickly without an extensive setup.

[Render](https://render.com) is a cloud platform to build and run apps and websites with free SSL, a global CDN, private networks, and automatic deploys with Git.

## Step By Step Installation

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/posthog/render-example)

1. Click Deploy to Render above.

2. Follow the prompts to create an account (if you don't have one already) and approve the creation of your PostHog services. You may need to add credit card details, but PostHog can be deployed for free within their trial period. Check [Render's pricing](https://render.com/pricing) for more information.

3. Once your deploy has completed, you will be able to access your PostHog instance by going to the URL found on the "Service" dashboard.

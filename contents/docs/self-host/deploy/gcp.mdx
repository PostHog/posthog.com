First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official GCP [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) for more info). Note that GCP defaults to non-expandable volumes, to get an expandable volume see TODO (verify default too).

## Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "gcp"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
kafka:
  persistence:
    size: 20Gi
```

### Installing the chart

## Set up a static IP

1. Open the Google Cloud Console
1. Go to VPC Networks > [External IP addresses](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/addresses/list)
1. Add a new global static IP with the name `posthog`

## Setting up DNS

Create a record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

## Troubleshooting
### I cannot connect to my PostHog instance after creation

If DNS has been updated properly, check whether the SSL certificate was created successfully.

This can be done via the following command:

```console
gcloud beta --project yourproject compute ssl-certificates list
```

If running the command shows the SSL cert as `PROVISIONING`, that means that the certificate is still being created. [Read more on how to troubleshoot Google SSL certificates here](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/troubleshooting).

As a troubleshooting tool, you can allow HTTP access by setting `ingress.gcp.forceHttps` and `web.secureCookies` both to false, but we recommend always accessing PostHog via https.

First, we need to set up a Kubernetes cluster (see the official GCP [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) for more info).

<ClusterRequirementsSnippet />

> Note: in order to reduce the overhead of managing stateful services like PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis and ClickHouse by yourself, we suggest you to run them _outside_ Kubernetes and offload their provisioning, building and maintenance operations:
>
> * for PostgreSQL, take a look at [Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres)
> * for Apache Kafka, take a look at [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/)
> * for Redis, take a look at [Google Cloud Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore) and [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/)
> * for ClickHouse, take a look at [Altinity Cloud](https://altinity.com/cloud-database/)
>

## Chart configuration

Here's the minimal required `values.yaml` that we'll be using later. You can find an overview of the parameters that can be configured during installation under [configuration](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
```yaml
cloud: "gcp"
ingress:
  hostname: <your-hostname>
```

### Installing the chart

<InstallingSnippet />

## Set up a static IP

1. Open the Google Cloud Console
1. Go to VPC Networks > [External IP addresses](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/addresses/list)
1. Add a new global static IP with the name `posthog`

## Setting up DNS

Create a record from your desired hostname to the external IP.

## Troubleshooting
### I cannot connect to my PostHog instance after creation

If DNS has been updated properly, check whether the SSL certificate was created successfully.

This can be done via the following command:

```shell
gcloud beta --project yourproject compute ssl-certificates list
```

If running the command shows the SSL cert as `PROVISIONING`, that means that the certificate is still being created. [Read more on how to troubleshoot Google SSL certificates here](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/troubleshooting).

As a troubleshooting tool, you can allow HTTP access by setting `ingress.gcp.forceHttps` and `web.secureCookies` both to false, but we recommend always accessing PostHog via https.

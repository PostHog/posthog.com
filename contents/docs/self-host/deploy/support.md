## Support for open-source deployments of PostHog

PostHog at production scale is a data-intensive application with a complex system architecture.

Frequently, errors with self-hosted PostHog are due to incorrect configurations or management.

Unfortunately, as a small team, we don't have the bandwidth for troubleshooting instance-specific issues for open-source users of PostHog. However, if you identify an issue with the open-source deployment PostHog please create a GitHub issue on the [repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new/choose) including the steps to reproduce, open a Pull Request to fix it, or visit the [documentation](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new/choose).

For troubleshooting your own problems the [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting) and [runbooks](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting) will likely be useful.

If you aren't able to fix the problem yourself here are some other options:

- Migrate from the self-hosted PostHog to PostHog Cloud
  - [Guide on how to migrate here](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-between-cloud-and-self-hosted)
  - If you have any problems migrating feel free to message us in [Slack](https://posthog.com/slack) or send us an email at [hey@posthog.com](mailto:hey@posthog.com) and we will be happy to help
- 3rd party support
  - Reach out to a relevant [PostHog partner](https://posthog.com/partners). Several customers have had a good experience with [Altinity](https://posthog.com/partners/altinity) for Clickhouse and Kubernetes issues
  - Work with a software engineering contractor
- Upgrade to PostHog Enterprise
  - [Book a call](https://posthog.com/book-a-demo) or send us an email at [hey@posthog.com](mailto:hey@posthog.com)

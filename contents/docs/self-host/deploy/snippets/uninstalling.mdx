To uninstall the chart using [Helm >= v3](https://helm.sh/) with the release name `posthog` in `posthog` namespace, run the following:
```shell
helm uninstall posthog --namespace posthog
```

> See [the Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for documentation on the `helm uninstall` command.

The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release. Sometimes everything doesn't get properly removed. If that happens try deleting the namespace:
```shell
kubectl delete namespace posthog
```

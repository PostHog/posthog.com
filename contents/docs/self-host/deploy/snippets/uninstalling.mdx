To uninstall the chart with the release name `posthog` in `posthog` namespace, you can run: `helm uninstall posthog --namespace posthog` (take a look at the [Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for more info about the command).

The command above removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
Sometimes everything doesn't get properly removed. If that happens try deleting the namespace: `kubectl delete namespace posthog`.

To upgrade the chart using [Helm >= v3](https://helm.sh/) with the release name `posthog` in `posthog` namespace, do the following:

1. get and update the helm repo

<CommandHelmGetRepoSnippet />

2. Check if it's going to be a major upgrade

```shell
helm list -n posthog
helm search repo posthog
```
Compare the numbers for the chart version (looks like `posthog-3.15.1`) you see in the commands above, if the first number is different it means we'll be doing a major upgrade. Check the [upgrade notes](/docs/self-host/deploy/upgrade-notes) before moving forward.

3. Run the upgrade

<CommandHelmUpgradeSnippet />

Check the Helm [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for more info about the `helm upgrade` command.

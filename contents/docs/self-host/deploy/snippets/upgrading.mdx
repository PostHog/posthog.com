To upgrade the chart using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) with the release name `posthog` in `posthog` namespace, do the following:

1. Get and update the helm repo:

<CommandHelmGetRepoSnippet />

2. Check if it's going to be a major version upgrade:

```shell
helm list -n posthog
helm search repo posthog
```
Compare the numbers for the chart version (in the format `posthog-{major}.{minor}.{patch}` - for example, `posthog-3.15.1`) when running the commands above. If the upgrade is for a major version, check the [upgrade notes](/docs/self-host/deploy/upgrade-notes) before moving forward.

3. (optional) Grab the up-to-date values.yaml file and save to values.yaml

```shell
helm get values posthog -n posthog
```

4. Run the upgrade

<CommandHelmUpgradeSnippet />

Check the Helm [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for more info about the `helm upgrade` command.

<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
If you see this error

```
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: release posthog failed, and has been rolled back due to atomic being set: post-upgrade hooks failed: warning: Hook post-upgrade posthog/templates/migrate.job.yaml failed: jobs.batch "posthog-migrate" already exists
```

it happens because the migrate job was left around from a previous upgrade attempt, we just need to kill that job (`kubectl -n posthog delete job $(kubectl -n posthog get jobs --no-headers -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name)`) before running the upgrade again.
  
  
If you see this error
  
```
 UPGRADE FAILED: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists.
```
Follow [these instructions](/docs/self-host/deploy/upgrade-notes#upgrading-from-3xx%23upgrading-from-10xx#upgrading-from-10xx) before running the upgrade command again.

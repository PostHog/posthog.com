As a troubleshooting tool, you can allow HTTP access by setting these values in your `values.yaml`, but we recommend always accessing PostHog via HTTPs.
```yaml
ingress:
  nginx:
    enabled: true
    redirectToTLS: false
  letsencrypt: false
web:
  secureCookies: false
```

After upgrading you can run the following command to get the URL to access PostHog:

<GetInstallationAddress />

As a troubleshooting tool, you can allow HTTP access by setting these values in your `values.yaml`, but we recommend always accessing PostHog via https.
```yaml
ingress:
  nginx:
    redirectToTLS: false
  letsencrypt: false
web:
  secureCookies: false
```

After upgrading you can run the following to get the IP to access PostHog:
```console
export INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get --namespace posthog ingress posthog -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
echo "Visit http://$INGRESS_IP to use PostHog\!"
```

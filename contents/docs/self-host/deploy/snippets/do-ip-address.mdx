1. Navigate to the IP address of the load balancer created by Kubernetes using your web browser. You can grab this by using the DigitalOcean web console ([networking tab](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/load_balancers)).

2. If you have `kubectl` installed and configured for the cluster that PostHog is deployed to then run these commands to get your installation location:
```console
export INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get --namespace posthog ingress posthog -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
echo "Your PostHog IP address is $INGRESS_IP"
echo "Visit http://$INGRESS_IP to use PostHog!"
```

> **Note:** Self-hosting PostHog means managing the service yourself. This means running regular upgrades, scaling, etc. If you are less technical or looking for a hands-off experience, we recommend [PostHog Cloud](/docs/cloud). You can also find support partners to manage the service for you via [the PostHog Marketplace](/marketplace).

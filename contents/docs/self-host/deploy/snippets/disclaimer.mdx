> **Self-host vs PostHog Cloud:** Self-hosting PostHog means managing the service yourself
and taking care of upgrades, scaling, security etc. If you are less
technical or looking for a hands-off experience, we recommend
[PostHog Cloud](/docs/cloud). You can also find support partners to
manage the service for you via [the PostHog Marketplace](/marketplace).

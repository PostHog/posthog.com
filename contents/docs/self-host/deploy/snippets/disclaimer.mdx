> **Self-host vs PostHog Cloud:**<br/>
Self-hosting PostHog means managing the service yourself, taking care of upgrades, scaling, security etc.<br/><br/>
If you are less technical or looking for a hands-off experience,
and if you want to optimize your budget, we recommend
[PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).<br/><br/>
PostHog Cloud is also considerably cheaper than paying for cloud hosting.
You can find more information about PostHog Cloud's costs on the [pricing page](/pricing).<br/><br/>
You can also find support partners to
manage the service for you via [the PostHog Marketplace](/marketplace).

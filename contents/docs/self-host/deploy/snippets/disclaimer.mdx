> **Open-source PostHog vs PostHog Cloud**<br/>
Self-hosted open-source deployment is **not** recommended in production and is unlikely to handle >100k events/month. There's significant complexity around deployment and maintenance with a high risk of data loss. <br/><br/>
As a small team we can only provide [limited support for open-source PostHog](/docs/self-host/open-source/support).<br/><br/>
For most companies we'd recommend [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).<br/><br/>
If you are a large company with significant data isolation needs checkout [PostHog Enterprise Self-Hosted](docs/self-host/enterprise/overview).

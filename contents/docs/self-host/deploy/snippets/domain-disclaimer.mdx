> **Do not use the word `posthog` as your sub-domain record:**
As we grow, PostHog owned domains might be added to tracker blockers.
To reduce the risk of tracker blockers interfering with events sent to your self-hosted instance,
we suggest to avoid the word `posthog`, or any combination of it, as your sub-domain record.

> **Do not use `posthog` or tracking related words as your sub-domain record:**
As we grow, PostHog owned domains might be added to tracker blockers.
To reduce the risk of tracker blockers interfering with events sent to your self-hosted instance,
we suggest to avoid using any combination of potentially triggering words as your sub-domain.
Examples of words to avoid are: `posthog`, `tracking`, `tracker`, `analytics`, `metrics`.

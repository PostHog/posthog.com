#### Cluster requirements
* Kubernetes version >= 1.19
* Ensure your cluster has enough resources to run PostHog (we suggest a total minimum of 4 vcpu & 8GB of memory).
* Suggestion: ensure the `AllowVolumeExpansion` parameter is set to `True` in the storage class definition (this setting enables `PVC` resize)
    <details>

    `PersistentVolumes` can be configured to be expandable. This feature when set to `true`, allows the users to resize the volume by editing the corresponding `PVC` object.

    This can become useful in case your storage usage grows and you want to resize the disk on-the-fly without having to resync data across PVCs.

    To verify if your default storage class allows volume expansion you can run:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get storageclass -o json | jq '.items[].allowVolumeExpansion'
    true
    ```

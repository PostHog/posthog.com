#### Cluster requirements
* Kubernetes version >= 1.19
* Ensure your cluster has enough resources to run PostHog (we suggest a total minimum of 4 vcpu & 8GB of memory)
* Suggestion: ensure `AllowVolumeExpansion` is set to `True` in the storage class definition (this setting enables `PVC` resize)
    <details>

    `PersistentVolumes` can be configured to be expandable. This feature when set to `true`, allows the users to resize the volume by editing the corresponding `PersistentVolumeClaims` object.

    This can become useful in case your storage usage grows and you want to resize the disk on-the-fly without having to resync data across PVCs.

    To verify if your storage class allows volume expansion you can run:

    ```shell
    kubectl get storageclass -o json | jq '.items[].allowVolumeExpansion'
    true
    ```

    In case it returns `false`, you can enable volume expansion capabilities for your storage class by running:

    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass -p '{"allowVolumeExpansion": true}'
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io/gp2 patched
    ```

    > N.B:
    >  - expanding a persistent volume is a time consuming operation
    >  - some platforms have a per-volume quota of one modification every 6 hours
    >  - not all the volume types support this feature. Please take a look at the [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#allow-volume-expansion) for more info

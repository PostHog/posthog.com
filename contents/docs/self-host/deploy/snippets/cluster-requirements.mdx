#### Cluster requirements
* Kubernetes version >=1.19 <= 1.22
* Ensure your cluster has enough resources to run PostHog (we suggest a total minimum of 4 vcpu & 8GB of memory)
* Suggestion: ensure `allowVolumeExpansion` is set to `True` in the storage class definition (this setting enables `PVC` resize)
    <details>

    `PersistentVolumes` can be configured to be expandable. This feature when set to `true`, allows the users to resize the volume by editing the corresponding `PersistentVolumeClaims` object.

    This can become useful in case your storage usage grows and you want to resize the disk on-the-fly without having to resync data across PVCs.

    To verify if your storage class allows volume expansion you can run:

    ```shell
    kubectl get storageclass -o json | jq '.items[].allowVolumeExpansion'
    true
    ```

    In case it returns `false`, you can enable volume expansion capabilities for your storage class by running:

    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass -p '{"allowVolumeExpansion": true}'
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io/gp2 patched
    ```

    > N.B:
    >  - expanding a persistent volume is a time consuming operation
    >  - some platforms have a per-volume quota of one modification every 6 hours
    >  - not all the volume types support this feature. Please take a look at the [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#allow-volume-expansion) for more info

* Suggestion: ensure `reclaimPolicy` is set to `Retain` in the storage class definition (this setting allows for manual reclamation of the resource)
    <details>

    The `Retain` reclaim policy allows for manual reclamation of the resource. When the PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, the PersistentVolume still exists and the volume is considered "released".
    But it is not yet available for another claim because the previous claimant's data remains on the volume (see the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaiming)).

    This can become useful in case your need to reprovision a pod/statefulset but you don't want to lose the underlying data

    To verify which `reclaimPolicy` is your default storage class using you can run:

    ```shell
    kubectl get storageclass -o json | jq '.items[].reclaimPolicy'
    "Retain"
    ```

    If your storage class allows it, you can modify the `reclaimPolicy` by running:

    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass -p '{"reclaimPolicy": "Retain"}'
    storageclass.storage.k8s.io/gp2 patched
    ```

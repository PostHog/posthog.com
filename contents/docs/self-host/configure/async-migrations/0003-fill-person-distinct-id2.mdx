[`0002_fill_distinct_id2`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/async_migrations/migrations/0003_fill_person_distinct_id2.py) is an async migration added to to migrate the data from the old `person_distinct_id` table to the new `person_distinct_id2` table.

The reason this is needed is for faster `person_distinct_id` queries as the old schema worked off of (`distinct_id`, `person_id`) pairs, making it expensive to for our analytics queries, which need to map from `distinct_id` -> latest `person_id`. 

The new schema works off of `distinct_id` columns, leveraging `ReplacingMergeTrees` with a version column we store in postgres.

We migrate teams one-by-one to avoid running out of memory.

The migration strategy:
    1. write to both pdi and pdi2 any new updates (done prior to this migration)
    2. insert all non-deleted (`team_id`, `distinct_id`, `person_id`) rows from pdi into pdi2 (this migration)
    3. Once migration has run, we only read/write from/to pdi2.

## FAQ

### Is it dangerous for this migration to be in error state?

No, the migration copies data to the new table, but that new table is not used until the migration has successfully completed.

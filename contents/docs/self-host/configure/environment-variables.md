As of [PostHog 1.33.0](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-33-0) some settings can now be managed directly in the app, without having to connect to your cluster and/or redeploy. If you are on version 1.33.0 or newer, please review [Instance settings](/docs/self-host/configure/instance-settings) first.

For settings that can be managed with Instance Settings, you can either set the values via environment variables or through the Instance Settings page in your instance. However, it is strongly **recommended to use Instance settings.** Environment variables are only loaded when there are no values in Instance settings, which means that environment variables could reflect outdated values.

For other settings, there are various environment variables you can set to configure your instance. Below is a comprehensive list of all of them. However, for general use, you most likely do not have to worry about the vast majority of these.

Rows with a missing 'Default Value' usually default to an empty string. This is different from `None`.

Some variables here are default Django variables. This [Django Docs page](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/) has more information about them.

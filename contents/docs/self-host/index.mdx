The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is to use [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).

However, if you're a large company with the need to self-host or an engineer looking to use the open-source version in funky non-production way then you're in the right place!

## PostHog Open-Source

<Disclaimer />

The core of PostHog is open-source and always will be. You can self-host PostHog the open-source version in weird and wonderful ways such as running it in your basement to [monitor a home IoT system](https://gist.github.com/mariusandra/d8add5fc7f32bedeae45d9ce8eb75b35).

It is not possible to upgrade from PostHog open-source to PostHog Scale (the feature complete version of PostHog).

For more information on deployment go to [open-source deployment](/docs/self-host/open-source/deployment).

## PostHog Enterprise

Built for large companies with significant data isolation requirements. Requires a minimum contract of $5,000/month.

Deployment options:
- Deploy PostHog using Kubernetes on your own cloud
    - This requires knowledge of Kubernetes and your engineering team's time for deployment and ongoing maintenance. We are happy to provide reasonable [support](/docs/self-host/enterprise/support).
    - [Enterprise deployment](/docs/self-host/enterprise/overview) contains the information you need to get set up - we recommend you get a license key first.

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is to use [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).

But if you're an engineer looking to use the open-source version in a funky non-production way, or on a smaller hobby project, then you're in the right place!

## PostHog Open-Source

<Disclaimer />

The core of PostHog is open-source and always will be.

For more information on deployment go to [open-source deployment](/docs/self-host/open-source/deployment).

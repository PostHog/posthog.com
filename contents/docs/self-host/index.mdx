The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is to use [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).

However, if you're a large company with the need to self-host or an engineer looking to use the open-source version in a funky non-production way then you're in the right place!

## PostHog Open-Source

<Disclaimer />

The core of PostHog is open-source and always will be.

It is not possible to upgrade from PostHog Open-Source to Enterprise within the same instance. It requires setting up a new instance of PostHog and then performing a [full migration](/docs/migrate/migrate-between-posthog-instances). 

For more information on deployment go to [open-source deployment](/docs/self-host/open-source/deployment).

## PostHog Enterprise

PostHog Enterprise is built for large companies with significant data isolation requirements. It requires a minimum contract of $5,000/month, which includes 40 million events and 80,000 sessions each month, and dedicated support.

Before committing to self-hosting, however, we recommend exploring [PostHog Cloud Enterprise](/pricing). It satisfies the compliance and privacy needs of most customers, including the option to host in the EU for GDPR compliance. 

All Enterprise plans include:

- SAML-based single sign-on
- Advanced permissions, including private projects
- A dedicated Slack support channel

You have two options if self-hosting PostHog Enterprise is the best solution for you:

### 1. Deploy PostHog using Kubernetes on your own cloud

- This requires knowledge of Kubernetes and your engineering team's time for deployment and ongoing maintenance. We are happy to provide reasonable [support](/docs/self-host/enterprise/support).

- [Enterprise deployment](/docs/self-host/enterprise/overview) contains the information you need to get set up â€“ we recommend you get a license key first.

- To get the license key, [book a call](/book-a-demo) with our customer success team.

### 2. Work with a PostHog partner

- Several of our [partners](/partners) offer self-hosted PostHog as a managed service on your own cloud, and dedicated deployment support. 
 
- [Book a call](/book-a-demo) with our customer success team where we can direct you to the ideal partner for you, and get you started on PostHog Enterprise.

> If you're attempting this migration, feel free to ask questions and provide feedback via the [PostHog Communty Slack workspace](/slack) or [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues). You should also be aware that **some of the steps on this document are potentially destructive**! Proceed with caution.

## Requirements

-   You should have an account on [PostHog Cloud](/docs/cloud).
-   Your self-hosted instance should be running a minimum version of `1.30.0`

## Approach

We will only be migrating data used to run analytical queries, such as events, persons and person distinct IDs. This means that dashboard configuration, feature flags and other data that is not used in analytical queries will need to be recreated on cloud.

With this migration, we will migrate over your events using a PostHog plugin, which will create the necessary person, person distinct ID, and related records in cloud.

Create a new cluster resource that will take care of signing your TLS certificates using [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

1. Create a new file called `cluster-issuer.yaml` with the following content. Note: please remember to replace `your-name@domain.com`
with a valid email address as you will receive email notifications on certificate renewals:

  ```yaml file=cluster-issuer.yaml
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: ClusterIssuer
  metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
  spec:
    acme:
      email: "your-name@domain.com"
      server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
      privateKeySecretRef:
        name: posthog-tls
      solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            class: nginx
  ```

1. Deploy this new resource to your cluster by running: `kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml`

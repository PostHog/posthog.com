Self-hosted open-source deployment is made for hobbyists or hosting PostHog in weird and wonderful ways (like in your basement).

It's MIT licensed and provided without guarantee. You should be confident in your security knowledge to run it. It is unlikely to handle >100k events/month with a high risk of data loss. As a small team we can only provide [limited support for open-source PostHog](/docs/self-host/open-source/support).

For most companies we'd recommend [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).

If you are a large company with significant data isolation needs, checkout [PostHog Enterprise Self-Hosted](/docs/self-host/enterprise/overview).

Self-hosted open-source deployment is made for hobbyists, hosting PostHog in [weird and wonderful ways](https://gist.github.com/mariusandra/d8add5fc7f32bedeae45d9ce8eb75b35). 

It's not recommended in production and is unlikely to handle >100k events/month and there's a high risk of data loss. As a small team we can only provide [limited support for open-source PostHog](/docs/self-host/open-source/support).

For most companies we'd recommend [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud).

If you are a large company with significant data isolation needs, checkout [PostHog Enterprise Self-Hosted](/docs/self-host/enterprise/overview).

Self-hosted open-source deployment is made for hobbyists or hosting PostHog in weird and wonderful ways (like in your basement).

It's MIT licensed and provided without guarantee. You should be confident in your security knowledge to run it. Everything runs on a single machine, and thus is unlikely to scale past a couple 100ks events without significant effort in scaling. As a small team we can only provide [limited support for open-source PostHog](/docs/self-host/open-source/support).

For most companies we'd recommend [PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud), which comes with a very generous free tier.

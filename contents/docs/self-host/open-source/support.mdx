## Support for open-source deployments of PostHog

PostHog at production scale is a data-intensive application with a complex system architecture.

Frequently, errors with self-hosted PostHog are due to incorrect configurations or management.

Unfortunately, as a small team, we don't have the bandwidth for troubleshooting instance-specific issues for open-source users of PostHog. However, if you identify an issue with the open-source deployment for PostHog please create a GitHub issue on the [repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new/choose) including the steps to reproduce, open a Pull Request to fix it, or visit the [documentation](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new/choose).

The [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting) and [runbooks](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting) will likely be useful. If none of the above works, you may want to consider [migrating](/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud) from the self-hosted PostHog to PostHog Cloud (which has a generous free tier).

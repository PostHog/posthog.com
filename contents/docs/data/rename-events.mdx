tl;dr: Use Actions.

One thing I've noticed as I'm getting started here at PostHog is a bias
towards action. Get stuff done, then get it right.

Once you get your PostHog account up and running, the next step is to start
sending events. Events are an elemental unit of data in PostHog. They
represent an interaction a user has with your app or website.

Examples include button clicks, pageviews, query completions, and signups.

But what if you want to rename an event?

You renamed your "Get Started" button to "LFG" but now all your existing
events don't make sense. And you probably don't want to sift through hundreds
of thousands of events and rename them.

## Actions

The solution is to start sending events with the new name. And then use
[Actions](https://posthog.com/docs/data/actions) to group them. Actions are a
way of combining several related events into one.

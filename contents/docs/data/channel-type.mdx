It is calculated using the referring domain, [UTM tags](/docs/data/utm-segmentation), and advertising IDs that are present in the URL when the user first lands on your website,.

### Channel type calculation

Traffic is considered "Paid" if any of the following are true:

* `utm_medium` is one of `cpc`, `cpm`, `cpv`, `cpa`, `ppc` or `retargeting`
* `utm_medium` starts with `paid`
* Either `gclid` or `gad_source` is present

We use a list of known values for `referring_domain`, `utm_source`, and `utm_medium`, which you can view in the [source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/models/channel_type/channel_definitions.json).

These rules are applied in order, and the first one that matches is used to determine the channel type.

Our definitions were based on the [definitions that GA4 uses](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en), but added our own logic to handle some edge cases they don't.

> **Want custom channel types?** You can define rules to match incoming events to your own custom channel types in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-web-analytics). Read more in [web analytics docs](/docs/web-analytics/dashboard#custom-channel-type).

It is calculated using the [UTM tags](./utm-segmentation) present in the URL when the user first lands on your website,
as well as the referring domain, and Advertising IDs that are present in the URL.

### Channel type calculation

Traffic is considered "Paid" if any of the following are true:
* `utm_medium` is one of `cpc`, `cpm`, `cpv`, `cpa`, `ppc` or `retargeting`
* `utm_medium` starts with `paid`
* Either `gclid` or `gad_source` is present

We use a list of known values for `referring_domain`, `utm_source`, and `utm_medium`, which you can view in the [source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/models/channel_type/channel_definitions.json).

These rules are applied in order, and the first one that matches is used to determine the channel type.

If you would to be able to customise this logic, please upvote [this issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/21195). Our definitions were based on the [definitions that GA4 uses](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891?hl=en), but added our own logic to handle some edge cases they don't.

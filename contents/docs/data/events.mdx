An event is the core unit of data in PostHog. It represents an interaction a user has with your app or website. Examples include button clicks, pageviews, query completions, and signups.

Events consist of:

1. An `event` name like `$pageview` or `query completed`. Events starting with `$` are PostHog defaults.

2. A `distinct_id` which is a unique identifier for [person](/docs/data/person), commonly a `uuidv7` value like `018daf23-89b3-7cf8-a4f1-94064c96df90`

3. A `timestamp` in ISO 8601 format, which is the time the event occurred like `2024-05-22T17:09:29.220Z`. This is most commonly `now()`, but can also be in the past. 

4. `properties`, which are additional data like `color` or `$current_url`. Properties starting with `$` are PostHog defaults.

You can [capture custom events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events) using any of [our SDKs](/docs/libraries) or [our API](/docs/api/capture). PostHog's client-side SDKs, like [JavaScript Web](/docs/libraries/js) and [React Native](/docs/libraries/react-native), can also [autocapture](/docs/data/autocapture) events for you.

You can view recent events in your [activity tab](https://us.posthog.com/events), which automatically updates every 30 seconds for a live view of activity in your app.

## How events power PostHog

PostHog is event-based, meaning much of the functionality is triggered through events. Much of this is handled (and made nicer) by our SDKs, but under the hood, it is largely events. For example:

- Changing [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties) using `$set` and `$unset` properties. 

- [Identifying](/docs/product-analytics/identify) an anonymous user with the `$identify` event.

- Connecting two users with the [`$create_alias`](/docs/product-analytics/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) event.

- Creating and updating [groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) using `$groupidentify` events and `$group` properties. 

- Calculating bounce rate for web analytics relies on the `$pageleave` event.

- Calculating exposure and statistical significance for [experimentation](/docs/experiments) with the `$feature/experiment-feature-flag-key` property and `$feature_flag_called` event.

- Sending data to webhooks is triggered by ingesting specific events.

## Event properties

Like persons and sessions, events have properties. These are used for [filtering](/docs/product-analytics/trends/filters), [breakdowns](/docs/product-analytics/trends/breakdowns), [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts), targeting, and more.

While ingesting events, PostHog detects some type information for properties such as:

- Strings AKA text (default)
- Boolean
- Dates and [timestamps](/docs/data/timestamps)
- Numbers
- Arrays
- Objects

If something has been detected incorrectly, you can manually change the type by going to [properties tab in data management](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/properties), selecting the property, clicking on `Edit`, and then changing the property type manually. You can also add tags or mark a property as verified on this page.

## Anonymous vs identified events

By default, PostHog captures identified events. This means all events create a [person profile](/docs/data/persons) and set [person properties](/docs/data/product-analytics/person-properties). 

If you don't need person profiles or properties, you can capture anonymous events. Under our current [pricing](/pricing), anonymous events can be up to 4x cheaper than identified events (due to the cost of processing them).

To capture anonymous events, set the `person_profiles` JavaScript Web config option to `identified_only` or capture an event with the `$process_person_profile` property set to `false`.

```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        $process_person_profile: false,
    },
})
```

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct_id',
    event='event_name',
    properties={
        '$process_person_profile': False
    }
)
```

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
  "event": "event_name",
  "distinct_id": "distinct_id",
  "properties": {
    "$process_person_profile": false
  },
  "timestamp": "2020-08-16T09:03:11.913767"
}' <ph_client_api_host>/capture/

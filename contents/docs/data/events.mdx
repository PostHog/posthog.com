## What is an event?

An event is any recordable interaction a user has in your application or website. Clicking a button, or visiting a page, is an event. Moving a mouse cursor isn't.

You can create custom events, but PostHog also autocaptures many basic events (e.g. pageviews) for you. See our [Autocapture docs](/docs/data/autocapture) for more on what it does and doesn't capture.

You can view recent events from the [Activity page](https://us.posthog.com/events) in PostHog, which can be set to automatically update every 30 seconds for a live view of activity in your app.

## Default events and properties

You may notice that some events or properties are prefixed with `$` – e.g., `$pageview`, `$feature_flag_called`, `$current_url`, or `$os_version`. This indicates that these are default PostHog events or properties.

### Pageview events

`$pageview` events are automatically sent when using the [JavaScript snippet or SDK](/docs/libraries/js). You can disable this by setting `capture_pageview: false` in the initialization [config](/docs/libraries/js#config).

You can manually send pageview events by calling `posthog.capture('$pageview')`. This is necessary for single-page applications like [React](/docs/libraries/react), [Next.js](/docs/libraries/next-js#pages-router) or [Vue](/docs/libraries/vue-js#capturing-page-views), since otherwise a pageview event is only sent for the first page.

### Pageleave events

Similar to pageview, `$pageleave` events are automatically sent. You can disable them by setting `capture_pageleave: false` in the [config](/docs/libraries/js#config). For single-page applications, you'll also need to manually send these events using `posthog.capture('$pageleave')`.

## Event filtering

You can filter events by [properties](/docs/integrate/client/js#sending-user-information) and [cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts) to focus on specific events that are occurring in your project.

While ingesting events in the plugin server PostHog detects some type information for properties to allow more intelligent filtering, such as:

-   Boolean
-   Dates and Timestamps
-   Numbers
-   Strings
-   Everything else

If you feel something has been detected incorrectly, you can manually change the type by going to `Data management -> Properties` selecting an event, clicking on `Edit`, and then changing the property type manually.

### Boolean (true or false)

PostHog detects boolean values and allows filtering by only:

-   equals
-   doesn't equal
-   is set
-   is not set

### Dates and Timestamps

PostHog detects several formats of string as dates and times:

-   YYYY-MM-DD,
-   Date and date and time strings from [the ISO8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601),
-   YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS,
-   DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm:SS,
-   DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:SS,
-   YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:SS
-   [the RFC 822 standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822)

In detection, day and month are interchangeable so MM-DD-YYYY would be detected as a date.

Ten and Thirteen digit numbers are detected as [timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) if the property name includes "time" or "timestamp"

Filtering against that property will then show a date picker and allows filtering only:

-   equals
-   before
-   after
-   is set
-   is not set

**See also:** [How PostHog calculates timestamps](/docs/data/timestamps).

### Numeric

PostHog detects numeric properties and allow filtering by only:

-   equals
-   doesn't equal
-   matches regex
-   doesn't match regex
-   greater than
-   lower than
-   is set
-   is not set

### Strings (text)

PostHog detects text content. If it is not true/false, numeric, or a date time. You can filter by:

-   equals
-   doesn't equal
-   contains
-   doesn't contain
-   matches regex
-   doesn't match regex
-   is set
-   is not set

## Push-based event tracking

Most users of PostHog will want to combine their back-end data, such as user information, with the front end actions of those users in their UI. There are three ways of passing data to PostHog:

-   Our [API](/docs/api/overview)
-   JS [snippet](/docs/integrate)
-   Client- and server-side [libraries](/docs/integrate)

## What is an event?

An event is any recordable interaction a user has in your application or website. Clicking a button, or visiting a page, is an event. Moving a mouse cursor isn't.

You can create custom events, but PostHog also autocaptures many basic events (e.g. pageviews) for you. See our [autocapture docs](/docs/data/autocapture) for more on what it does and doesn't capture.

You can view recent events from the [Activity page](https://us.posthog.com/events) in PostHog, which can be set to automatically update every 30 seconds for a live view of activity in your app.

## Default events and properties

You may notice that some events or properties are prefixed with `$` and show a PostHog icon next to them â€“ e.g., `$pageview`, `$feature_flag_called`, `$current_url`, or `$os_version`. This indicates that these are default PostHog events or properties.

### Pageview events

`$pageview` events are automatically sent when using the [JavaScript snippet or SDK](/docs/libraries/js). You can disable this by setting `capture_pageview: false` in the initialization [config](/docs/libraries/js#config).

You can manually send pageview events by calling `posthog.capture('$pageview')`. This is necessary for single-page applications like [React](/docs/libraries/react), [Next.js](/docs/libraries/next-js#pages-router) or [Vue](/docs/libraries/vue-js#capturing-page-views), since otherwise a pageview event is only sent for the first page.

### Pageleave events

Similar to pageview, `$pageleave` events are automatically sent. You can disable them by setting `capture_pageleave: false` in the [config](/docs/libraries/js#config). For single-page applications, you'll also need to manually send these events using `posthog.capture('$pageleave')`.

## Event filtering

You can filter events by [properties](/docs/integrate/client/js#sending-user-information) and [cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts) to focus on specific events that are occurring in your project.

While ingesting events, PostHog detects some type information for properties to allow more intelligent filtering, such as:

-   Boolean
-   Dates and Timestamps
-   Numbers
-   Strings
-   Everything else

If you feel something has been detected incorrectly, you can manually change the type by going to `Data management -> Properties` selecting an event, clicking on `Edit`, and then changing the property type manually.

### Boolean (true or false)

PostHog detects boolean values and allows filtering by only:

-   equals
-   doesn't equal
-   is set
-   is not set

### Dates and Timestamps

PostHog detects several formats of string as dates and times:

-   YYYY-MM-DD,
-   Date and date and time strings from [the ISO8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601),
-   YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS,
-   DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm:SS,
-   DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:SS,
-   YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:SS
-   [the RFC 822 standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822)

In detection, day and month are interchangeable so MM-DD-YYYY would be detected as a date.

Ten and Thirteen digit numbers are detected as [timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) if the property name includes "time" or "timestamp"

Filtering against that property will then show a date picker and allows filtering only:

-   equals
-   before
-   after
-   is set
-   is not set

**See also:** [How PostHog calculates timestamps](/docs/data/timestamps).

### Numeric

PostHog detects numeric properties and allow filtering by only:

-   equals
-   doesn't equal
-   matches regex
-   doesn't match regex
-   greater than
-   lower than
-   is set
-   is not set

### Strings (text)

PostHog detects text content. If it is not true/false, numeric, or a date time. You can filter by:

-   equals
-   doesn't equal
-   contains
-   doesn't contain
-   matches regex
-   doesn't match regex
-   is set
-   is not set

## Push-based event tracking

Most users of PostHog will want to combine their back-end data, such as user information, with the front end actions of those users in their UI. There are three ways of passing data to PostHog:

-   Our [API](/docs/api/overview)
-   JS [snippet](/docs/integrate)
-   Client- and server-side [libraries](/docs/integrate)

An event is the core unit of data in PostHog. It represents an interaction a user has with your app or website. Examples include button clicks, pageviews, query completions, and signups.

Events consist of:

1. An `event` name like `$pageview` or `query completed`. Events starting with `$` are PostHog defaults.

2. A `distinct_id` which is a unique identifier for [person](/docs/data/persons), commonly a `uuidv7` value like `018daf23-89b3-7cf8-a4f1-94064c96df90`

3. A `timestamp` in ISO 8601 format, which is the time the event occurred like `2024-05-22T17:09:29.220Z`. This is most commonly `now()`, but can also be in the past. 

4. `properties`, which are additional data like `color` or `$current_url`. Properties starting with `$` are PostHog defaults.

You can [capture custom events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events) using any of [our SDKs](/docs/libraries) or [our API](/docs/api/capture). PostHog's client-side SDKs, like [JavaScript Web](/docs/libraries/js) and [React Native](/docs/libraries/react-native), can also [autocapture](/docs/data/autocapture) events for you.

You can view recent events in your [activity tab](https://us.posthog.com/events), which automatically updates every 30 seconds for a live view of activity in your app.

## How events power PostHog

PostHog is event-based, meaning much of the functionality is triggered through events. Much of this is handled (and made nicer) by our SDKs, but under the hood, it is largely events. For example:

- Changing [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties) using `$set` and `$unset` properties. 

- [Identifying](/docs/product-analytics/identify) an anonymous user with the `$identify` event.

- Connecting two users with the [`$create_alias`](/docs/product-analytics/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) event.

- Creating and updating [groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) using `$groupidentify` events and `$group` properties. 

- Calculating bounce rate for web analytics relies on the `$pageleave` event.

- Calculating exposure and statistical significance for [experimentation](/docs/experiments) with the `$feature/experiment-feature-flag-key` property and `$feature_flag_called` event.

- Sending data to webhooks is triggered by ingesting specific events.

## Anonymous vs identified events

PostHog captures two types of events: **anonymous** and **identified**. Identified events enable you to attribute events to person profiles, while anonymous events do not.

See our docs on [anonymous vs identified events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) for more information.

## Event properties

Like persons and sessions, events have properties. These are used for [filtering](/docs/product-analytics/trends/filters), [breakdowns](/docs/product-analytics/trends/breakdowns), [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts), targeting, and more.

While ingesting events, PostHog detects some type information for properties such as:

- Strings AKA text (default)
- Boolean
- Dates and [timestamps](/docs/data/timestamps)
- Numbers
- Arrays
- Objects

If something has been detected incorrectly, you can manually change the type by going to [properties tab in data management](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/properties), selecting the property, clicking on `Edit`, and then changing the property type manually. You can also add tags or mark a property as verified on this page.

### Default properties

Below is a list of some of the properties that PostHog captures by default in client-side apps. You can see the full list of properties that PostHog captures by default in [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/src/utils/event-utils.ts).

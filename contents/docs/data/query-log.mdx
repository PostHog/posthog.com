The `query_log` table in PostHog's [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) provides access to query execution metadata and performance metrics. This table is built on top of the ClickHouse `system.query_log` table and offers a simplified, team-filtered interface for analyzing query performance. It filters for completed HogQL queries for your team.

It provides data that enables you to:

- Monitor query performance and resource usage
- Debug slow or failing queries  
- Analyze query patterns and usage metrics
- Track resource consumption (CPU, memory, I/O)

import { CalloutBox } from 'components/Docs/CalloutBox'

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Querying the query log efficiently" type="fyi">
  
Because the query log can be so large, it's important to query it efficiently.

- Use date/time filters to limit query scope for better performance
- Consider using `event_date` for efficient partitioning
- Large time ranges may require pagination for complex queries

## Query log use cases and examples

### Performance optimization

You can use the query log to identify slow queries. For example, to find slowest queries in the last 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT 
    query_duration_ms,
    hogql_name,
    query_start_time,
    read_rows,
    memory_usage,
    cpu_microseconds / 1e6 as cpu_sec
FROM query_log 
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY query_duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 10
```

You can also use the query log for resource analysis. For example, to analyze resource consumption by API endpoint:

```sql
SELECT 
    endpoint,
    count() as query_count,
    avg(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration,
    avg(memory_usage) as avg_memory,
    sum(read_bytes) as total_bytes_read,
    sum(cpu_microseconds / 1e6) as total_cpu_sec
FROM query_log 
WHERE event_date = today()
GROUP BY endpoint
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC
```

You can do something similar to track S3 operations and data transfer (applies to data warehouse queries, imported data, materialized views):

```sql
SELECT 
  event_date,
  sum(S3GetObject) as get_operations,
  sum(S3ListObjects) as list_operations,
  sum(ReadBufferFromS3Bytes) / 1024 / 1024 as mb_read_from_s3
FROM query_log 
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY event_date
ORDER BY event_date DESC
```

### Debugging and troubleshooting

The query log can help you find failing queries and understand failure patterns. 

```sql
SELECT 
  query_start_time,
  hogql_name,
  endpoint,
  query_duration_ms,
  substring(query, 1, 100) as query_preview
FROM query_log 
WHERE status IN ('ExceptionWhileProcessing', 'ExceptionBeforeStart')
  AND event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY query_start_time DESC
```

The benefit of this is that you can see the actual query that was executed and the error that was returned.

### Usage analytics

The query log lets you see what types of queries and usage patterns are most popular in your project. For example, to track query activity by user:

```sql
SELECT 
    created_by,
    count() as queries_run,
    avg(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration,
    max(query_duration_ms) as max_duration
FROM query_log 
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY created_by
ORDER BY queries_run DESC
```


### API key access tracking

This can also be useful to track API access patterns and permissions for security or compliance purposes.

For example, you can compare access patterns between personal API keys vs other methods.

```sql
SELECT
SELECT
    is_personal_api_key_request,
    count() as query_count,
    count(DISTINCT created_by) as unique_users,
    avg(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration,
    sum(read_bytes) / 1024 / 1024 as total_mb_read,
    sum(cpu_microseconds / 1e6) as total_cpu_sec
FROM query_log
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY is_personal_api_key_request
ORDER BY query_count DESC
```

For more specific tracking, you can monitor personal API key usage by specific keys (`api_key_mask` and `api_key_label` are only available when `is_personal_api_key_request` is `true`).

```sql
SELECT
    api_key_label,
    api_key_mask,
    count() as queries_run,
    avg(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms,
    sum(read_rows) as total_rows_processed,
    sum(cpu_microseconds / 1e6) as total_cpu_sec,
    min(query_start_time) as first_access,
    max(query_start_time) as last_access
FROM query_log
WHERE is_personal_api_key_request = true
  AND event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY api_key_label, api_key_mask
ORDER BY queries_run DESC
```

You can see daily personal API key usage stats for the last 30 days.

```sql
SELECT
    event_date,
    count() as daily_queries,
    count(DISTINCT api_key_mask) as unique_api_keys,
    avg(query_duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms,
    avg(memory_usage) / 1024 / 1024 as avg_mb_memory,
    sum(read_bytes) / 1024 / 1024 as total_mb_read,
    sum(cpu_microseconds / 1e6) as total_cpu_sec
FROM query_log
WHERE is_personal_api_key_request = true
  AND event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY event_date
ORDER BY event_date DESC


## Query log and its relationship to internal tables

> **Note:** This section is mostly useful for the internal PostHog team.

The `query_log` table is a virtual table that:

- Maps to the underlying `query_log_archive` ClickHouse table, which contains all system queries, not filtered by team
- Automatically filters queries by `team_id` for data isolation
- Only shows HogQL queries (`lc_query__kind = 'HogQLQuery'`)
- Provides simplified field names and data types

This is similar to: 

- **System tables** which access ClickHouse system information for broader analysis
- **Events tables** which correlate query performance with user activity patterns

### Technical architecture of the query log

```
system.query_log (ClickHouse system table)
    ↓ (materialized view)
query_log_archive (persistent storage)
    ↓ (HogQL mapping/filtering)
query_log (HogQL table - what users access)
```

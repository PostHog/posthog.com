People in PostHog represent the users behind your events. You can view them in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons).

People have [user properties](/docs/product-analytics/user-properties), which enables you do things like:

- Filter on user properties
- Create [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts)
- Use user properties for targeting feature flags, A/B tests, and surveys.
- Track initial UTM values and referrers across anonymous and [identified](/docs/product-analytics/identify) users.

## People and person profiles

Using people in PostHog requires capturing events with **person profiles**. Person profiles are how PostHog attributes events and properties to specific users. Examples of scenarios where you want to capture events with person profiles are:

- Tracking logged-in users in B2B and B2C SaaS apps
- Low volume API server events

On the other hand, there are many use cases that don't require person profiles, such as:

- Tracking a marketing website
- Content-focused sites
- B2C apps where users don't sign up or log in
- High volume API server events

Under our current [pricing](/pricing), events with person profiles are about 4x more expensive than events without them (due to the compute power required to work with them), so it's best to capture them only when needed i.e., in the scenarios described above.

### Capturing person profiles

For backward compatibility, PostHog captures events with person profiles by default. To change this in the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js), change the `person_profiles` [config](/docs/libraries/js#config) option:

import PersonProfilesJSConfig from '../../docs/libraries/js/_snippets/person-profiles-config.mdx'

<PersonProfilesJSConfig />

Other SDKs and the [API](/docs/api) can pass the `$process_person_profile` property in events. Again, person profiles are enabled by default, but you can disable this by setting the property to `false`.

Below is an example in Node, but the same applies to other SDKs:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
    event: 'movie_played',
    properties: {
        $process_person_profile: false,
    },
})
```

### Person profiles and distinct IDs

Below is good information to know when working with distinct IDs and person profiles:

- Every event has a `distinct_id` representing a user attached to it. However, not every `distinct_id` has an associated person profile.

- If a distinct ID already has a person profile created, any events captured with this distinct ID are considered events with a person profile. 
    - To opt out of this behavior, [delete the person](#deleting-person-data) in the person details UI in PostHog or use the `DELETE` operation of the [person API endpoint](/docs/api/persons#delete-api-projects-project_id-persons-id).


- Any `distinct_id` created before May 2024 will have a person profile created for them. This means all of their events will be counted as events with person properties.

## Viewing person profiles

Clicking on a person in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons) opens their profile and shows all their properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={personProfileLight}
    imageDark = {personProfileDark}
    alt="Person profile" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

- **Events** shows all the events a person has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all of the session replays a person has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so people who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) a person belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows [groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a person belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) that are enabled for the person.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the person's profile.

## Deleting person data

### In the PostHog app

- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email.
- Click on the person's ID
- Click **Delete person** to remove them and all their associated data from the PostHog instance. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

### Via the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.

Clicking on [People](https://us.posthog.com/persons) in the left-hand navigation opens a list containing all users, which you can then search.

All users have a alphanumeric ID. [Identified users](/docs/product-analytics/identify) have a distinct ID, normally `email`.

PostHog tracks user behavior, whether or not the user is logged in and identifiable.

## Person profiles

Clicking on a user opens their profile and shows all their properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={personProfileLight}
    imageDark = {personProfileDark}
    alt="Person profile" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

- **Events** shows all the events a user has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all session replays a user has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so users who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the cohorts a user belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows groups (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a user belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all feature flags that are enabled for a user.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the user's profile.

## Deleting person data

- Select 'Persons' from the left-hand menu
- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email
- Click on the person's ID
- Click 'Delete person' to remove them and all their associated data from the PostHog instance. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

## Deleting person data with the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.

## Events with person processing

By default all events create or update an associated person profile (see above). This allows for the following features:

- Person profiles
- Filtering on person properties
- Merging identities across distinct_ids (ie merging anonymous users with your logged in user)
- Cohort creation
- Feature flag targeting on properties
- Tracking initial UTM tags and referrers over time

However, there are many usecases that don't require this person processing. Because events that don't do person processing are cheaper for us to ingest, the pricing for these events is lower.

Some examples of usecases that often don't require user profiles
- Tracking a marketing website
- B2C apps where users don't sign up or log in
- High volume API server events

> For backward compatibility reasons, and to make sure we don't drop person information accidentally, processing events with persons is the default for configs without any option set. 

### PostHog-js

You can control whether events from PostHog-js have person processing enabled with the `process_persons` config setting. There are three options:

- `process_persons: 'always'` _(default)_ - we will process persons data for all events
- `process_persons: 'never'` - we won't process persons for any event. This means that anonymous users will not be merged once they sign up or login, so you lose the ability to create funnels that track users from anonyomous to identified. All events (including `$identify`) will be sent with `$process_persons: False`.
- `process_persons: 'identified_only'` - we will only process persons when you call `posthog.identify([distinct_id])`. Anonymous users won't get person profiles.

An example configuration would be

```js-web
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        process_persons: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```


### Other SDKs

When sending events from other SDKs, you can pass a `$process_persons` property. There are two options:

- `$process_persons: 'always'` _(default)_ - we will process persons data for this event
- `$process_persons: 'never'` - we won't process persons data for this event

An example for our node library would be:

```js
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
    event: 'api track event',
    properties: {
        $process_persons: 'never'
    },
})
```

Clicking on [People](https://us.posthog.com/persons) in the left-hand navigation opens a list containing all users, which you can then search.

All users have a alphanumeric ID. [Identified users](/docs/product-analytics/identify) have a distinct ID, normally `email`.

PostHog tracks user behavior, whether or not the user is logged in and identifiable.

## Person profiles

Clicking on a user opens their profile and shows all their properties.

- **Events** shows all the events a user has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all session replays a user has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so users who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the cohorts a user belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows groups (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a user belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all feature flags that are enabled for a user.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the user's profile.

## Deleting person data

- Select 'Persons' from the left-hand menu
- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email
- Click on the person's ID
- Click 'Delete person' to remove them and all their associated data from the PostHog instance. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

## Deleting person data with the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.

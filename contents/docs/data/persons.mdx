People in PostHog represent the users behind your events. You can view them in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons).

People have **person profiles** with [properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties). This enables you to do things like:

- Filter on person properties
- Create [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts)
- Use person properties for targeting feature flags, A/B tests, and surveys.
- Track initial UTM values and referrers across anonymous and [identified](/docs/product-analytics/identify) users.
- Query the `persons` table using [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql)

## How to create person profiles

When you capture your first [identified event](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) for a user, it creates a **person profile** for them. Then, any future events captured are attributed to this profile. You can also [set properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties) for the person.

## Viewing person profiles

Clicking on a person in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons) opens their profile and shows all their properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={personProfileLight}
    imageDark = {personProfileDark}
    alt="Person profile" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

- **Events** shows all the events a person has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all of the session replays a person has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so people who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) a person belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows [groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a person belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) that are enabled for the person.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the person's profile.

## Deleting person data

### In the PostHog app

- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email.
- Click on the person's ID
- Click **Delete person** to remove them and all their associated data. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

<CalloutBox icon="IconWarning" title="Reusing a deleted distinct_id" type="caution">

User deletion requests are not immediate. Instead, they are processed asynchronously. We recommend that you _avoid_ reusing a deleted `distinct_id` value for a new user, as it may lead to unexpected results while the deletion is being processed. Once the deletion process is fully processed, PostHog does not retain any data associated with the deleted `distinct_id`. 

If you must reuse the `distinct_id`, you can do so using the **Reset deleted person** tool, available from the dropdown at the top-right of the [**persons page**](https://app.posthog.com/persons). This tool allows you to reset a deleted `distinct_id` so that future events associated with it will create a new person profile.  

If you instead want to split a person with multiple IDs (e.g. to isolate bad data tied to a specific `distinct_id`), use the **Split IDs** button on their person profile.

### Via the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.

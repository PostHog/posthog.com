People in PostHog represent the users behind your events. You can view them in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons).

People have **person profiles** with [properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties). This enables you to do things like:

- Filter on person properties
- Create [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts)
- Use person properties for targeting feature flags, A/B tests, and surveys.
- Track initial UTM values and referrers across anonymous and [identified](/docs/product-analytics/identify) users.
- Query the `persons` table using [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql)

## How to create person profiles

When you capture your first [identified event](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) for a user, it creates a **person profile** for them. Then, any future events captured are attributed to this profile. You can also [set properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties) for the person.

## Viewing person profiles

Clicking on a person in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons) opens their profile and shows all their properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={personProfileLight}
    imageDark = {personProfileDark}
    alt="Person profile" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

- **Events** shows all the events a person has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all of the session replays a person has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so people who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) a person belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows [groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a person belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) that are enabled for the person.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the person's profile.

## Deleting person data

### In the PostHog app

- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email.
- Click on the person's ID
- Click **Delete person** to remove them and all their associated data. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

### Via the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.

People in PostHog represent the users behind your events. You can view them in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons).

People have [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties), which enables you do things like:

- Filter on person properties
- Create [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts)
- Use person properties for targeting feature flags, A/B tests, and surveys.
- Track initial UTM values and referrers across anonymous and [identified](/docs/product-analytics/identify) users.
- Query the `persons` table using [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql)

## People and person profiles

Using people in PostHog requires capturing **identified events**. These create **person profiles** that attribute events and properties to specific users. Examples of scenarios where you want to capture identified events are:

- Tracking logged-in users in B2B and B2C SaaS apps
- Doing user segmented product analysis
- Growth and marketing teams wanting to analyze the _complete_ conversion lifecycle

On the other hand, there are many use cases that don't require person profiles and can use **anonymous events**, such as:

- Tracking a marketing website
- Content-focused sites
- B2C apps where users don't sign up or log in
- High volume API server events

Under our current [pricing](/pricing), anonymous events can be up to 4x cheaper than identified events (due to the cost of processing them), so it's recommended to only capture identified events when needed.

### Capturing anonymous events

import HowToCaptureAnonymousEvents from '../../docs/libraries/js/_snippets/how-to-capture-anonymous-events.mdx'

### Person profiles and distinct IDs

Below is good information to know when working with distinct IDs and person profiles:

- Every event has a `distinct_id` representing a user attached to it. However, not every `distinct_id` has an associated person profile.

- If a distinct ID already has a person profile created, any events captured with this distinct ID are considered identified events. 

- Any `distinct_id` created before May 2024 will have a person profile created for them. This means all of their events will be counted as identified events.

## Viewing person profiles

Clicking on a person in the [People tab](https://us.posthog.com/persons) opens their profile and shows all their properties.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={personProfileLight}
    imageDark = {personProfileDark}
    alt="Person profile" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

- **Events** shows all the events a person has triggered, which you can search and filter to find specific events.

- **Recordings** shows all of the session replays a person has generated. Note this is subject to the retention policy of your plan, so people who haven't been active recently may have none.

- **Cohorts** shows all the [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts) a person belongs to.

- **Related groups:** shows [groups](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) (e.g. organizations, projects, and instances) a person belongs to.

- **Feature flags:** shows all [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) that are enabled for the person.

- **History:** shows any manual changes that have been made to the person's profile.

## Deleting person data

### In the PostHog app

- Search for the person via their unique ID. For example, their email.
- Click on the person's ID
- Click **Delete person** to remove them and all their associated data. You will be prompted to confirm this action.

### Via the API

You can also delete persons data via the API. See the [Data Deletion docs](/docs/privacy/data-deletion) for more information.

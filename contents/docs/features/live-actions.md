PostHog provides a simple list of all the Actions that are taking place in real time.

Get a sense in real time of how your Users are interacting with your site.

This is a useful area for debugging.

## Live Actions Log

To view this area, go to ‘Live actions’ in the left-hand navigation:

![Left hand navigation - live actions selected](../../images/02/Screenshot-2020-02-09-at-16.32.37.png)

You will see a list of every action in real time.

## Action Filtering

It’s also possible to filter actions by the properties of the underlying events.

This helps display a stream of just the data you care about, to reduce noise:

In the above example, we can see what is happening just on the PostHog homepage.

It is very easy to invite members to your PostHog team so that they can also be a part of your product analytics processes.

Go to "Invite Your Team' box at the bottom left of the left hand navigation:

This will open a modal where you can enable team invites and share the link with anyone you wish to invite to join your PostHog team.

It is very easy to invite members of your team so they can view Dashboards, create Actions and Trend Graphs.

## Inviting a New Team Member

Go to "Invite Your Team' box at the bottom left of the left hand navigation:

This will open a modal where you can enable team invites and share the link with anyone you wish to invite to join your PostHog team.

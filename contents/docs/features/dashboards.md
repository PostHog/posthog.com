You can create dashboard panels to display information you are collecting with PostHog. It will be the first thing you see when you log on to allow you to easily access the most important performance metrics in your product.

Dashboard panels can be created in two ways:

* From Action trends
* From Funnels 

This will give you the option to display information in tables, line charts or funnels 

## Creating an Action Trend dashboard

Go to ‘Actions’>’Trends’ in the left hand navigation:

You can now see the trend in these actions over time.

Once you have broken down your data by line chart or table you can then simply select "Add to dashboard" and you will then be asked to name your dashboard.

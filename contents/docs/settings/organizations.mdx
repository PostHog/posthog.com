## Organizations

An organization is the highest abstraction level within a PostHog instance. It's made up of projects (see more on them [here](/docs/settings/projects)) and members.

Most commonly a PostHog organization represents a real-world company or other type of isolated grouping.

Use the organization dropdown in the top bar to switch between organizations or create a new one.

PostHog Cloud users can create, manage, and join organizations without limits.

Organization members have different access levels based on their membership type. See more in our [access control docs](/docs/settings/access-control).

### Adding new members

Any organization member can create organization invites. Such an invite is valid **for 3 days** after creation and **only for the specified email**. Emails can be resent by removing and re-adding the invitee.

In an [email-enabled PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/email) (including PostHog Cloud) the invite is sent automatically to the specified email. If the PostHog instance can't send emails, remember to share the invite link yourself.

If there's no account associated with that email, the invited person will have to create an account. Otherwise, they'll be able to join with their existing account.

Newly-joined users get the basic Member access level.

### Deleting an organization

Organization can be deleted by any organization Owner. This action is irreversible. See the Danger Zone in your settings for more information.

### Notifications

By default every time a member joins an organization in an [email-enabled PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/email) (including PostHog Cloud), all existing members of the organization get notified about this with an email. This increases security by making it explicit who gains access to your product data.

If you'd rather not get such notifications, you can disable them in the "Notification Preferences" section of organization settings.

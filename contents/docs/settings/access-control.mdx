PostHog's access control system lets you manage permissions across three levels: organizations, projects, and resources. This hierarchical approach provides granular control over who can view and edit different parts of PostHog.

## Levels of access control

### 1. Organization level

Organization members have one of three access levels that determine their permissions for organization-wide settings and actions.

The three access levels are: Member, Admin, and Owner. An organization must have at least one Owner but can have more than one.

| Permission                                                                            | Member (base level) | Admin | Owner |

Access levels can be viewed and changed in the [Members section](https://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-members) of organization settings.

### 2. Project level

> This is currently being rolled out to all users so you may not see this experience yet. If you're interested in trying it out please email zach@posthog.com with "Access control beta" in the subject line.

Projects have two access levels: member and admin.

Each project has a default access level that applies to all organization members:

- **No access** - Members need explicit permission to access the project
- **Member** - All organization members have member-level access
- **Admin** - All organization members have admin-level access

And then you can override the default access level for specific members or roles. A user's effective level is the highest level granted across all sources.

Organization owners and admins automatically receive project admin level.

Project permissions:

| Permission                        | Member | Admin |
|------------------------------------|:------:|:-----:|

| Delete project                                                                  | <span className="text-red text-lg">✖</span>    | <span className="text-green text-lg">✔</span> |

| View/edit own or permitted resources (based on resource access controls)        | <span className="text-green text-lg">✔</span>  | <span className="text-green text-lg">✔</span> |
| View/edit all resources (no matter what resource access controls say)           | <span className="text-red text-lg">✖</span>    | <span className="text-green text-lg">✔</span> |

### 3. Resource level

> This is currently being rolled out to all users so you may not see this experience yet. If you're interested in trying it out please email zach@posthog.com with "Access control beta" in the subject line.

Resource access controls allow you to control who can view and edit specific resource objects. This can be access in the "Access control" sidebar when visiting a support resource.

Resource access controls are available for:
- Insights
- Dashboards
- Notebooks
- Feature flags
- (more resource types coming soon - looking for others? let us know!)

> This means we don't yet support limiting querying data, viewing replays, and access people data. We plan to add this support in the near future.

Resource access controls have three possible access levels:
- **No access** - Cannot view or edit the resource
- **View** - Can view but not modify the resource
- **Edit** - Can view and modify the resource

There are two ways to set resource level access controls:

#### a. Individual resource object

These access controls allow a user to control who can view and edit a specific resource object. This can be accessed in the project access controls in settings.

Resources default to "Edit" access when created. Those with permission can modify the default and set specific permissions for members and roles.

Resource creators and project admins can always view and edit resources as well as manage access controls. Only creators and project admins can manage the access controls for a resource object.

You cannot set resource level access controls for project admins since they always have full access.

    imageDark = {objectAccessControlDark}
    alt="Object access control" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

#### b. All resource objects of a given type in a project

These access controls allow you to control who can view and edit all resources of a given type in a project. These are set at the project level.

You can set default access levels for all resources of a given type in a project. This allows you to set it once and apply it to all resources of that type in the project (past and future).

Project wide access controls for resources take precedence over any individual resource object access controls.

You cannot set project wide access controls for project admins since they always have full access.

## Feature availability

### Free / Ridiculously cheap

These plans do not currently offer any access control features. All projects are open to all members and all resources are open to all members with "Edit" access.

### Teams

The Teams Add-on give Advanced permissions. 

The goal of this is to allow teams which requirements for stricter access to control who has access to their projects and resources.

On this plan, you can set default access levels for projects and resources and also set specific access levels for individual members but not roles.

### Enterprise

> While you can create roles on any plan, they can only be used for access control on Enterprise plans.

Instead of managing permissions individually, you can create roles to group users together. Roles can be assigned permissions at both the project and resource level.

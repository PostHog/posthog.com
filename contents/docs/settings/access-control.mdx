PostHog's access control system lets you manage permissions across three levels: organizations, projects, and resources. This hierarchical approach provides granular control over who can view and edit different parts of PostHog.

## Three levels of access control

### 1. Organization level

Organization members have one of three access levels that determine their permissions for organization-wide settings and actions.

There are three access levels in PostHog: Member, Admin, and Owner. An organization must have at lest one Owner.

| Permission                                                                            | Member (base level) | Admin | Owner |

Access levels can be viewed and changed in the [Members section](https://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-members) of organization settings.

### 2. Project level

> This is currently being rolled out to all users so you may not see this experience yet. If you're interested in trying it out please email zach@posthog.com with "Access control beta" in the subject line.

Each project has a default access level that applies to all organization members:

- **No access** - Members need explicit permission to access the project
- **Member** - All organization members have member-level access
- **Admin** - All organization members have admin-level access

Project permissions:
- **Members** can view and edit resources they create or are explicitly given access to
- **Admins** can view and edit all resources and manage access control settings

Organization owners and admins automatically receive project admin permissions.

You can override the default access level for specific members or [roles](#role-based-access-control). A user's effective permission is the highest level granted across all sources.

### 3. Resource level

> This is currently being rolled out to all users so you may not see this experience yet. If you're interested in trying it out please email zach@posthog.com with "Access control beta" in the subject line.

Access control is available for:
- Insights
- Dashboards
- Notebooks
- Feature flags
- (more resource types coming soon)

Each resource has three possible access levels:
- **No access** - Cannot view or edit the resource
- **View** - Can view but not modify the resource
- **Edit** - Can view and modify the resource

Resources default to "Edit" access when created. You can modify the default and set specific permissions for members and roles.

Resource creators and project admins can always view and edit resources as well as manage access controls.

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

> RBAC is only available on Enterprise plans

Instead of managing permissions individually, you can create roles to group users together. Roles can be assigned permissions at both the project and resource level.

## Feature availability

The Teams Add-on includes "Advanced Permissions" - the ability to set default access levels and member-specific access levels for projects and resources.

Enterprise adds role-based access control for managing access for groups of organization members.

<Step title="Capture conversion event" badge="required">

Once PostHog is initialized, you should be able to capture events. For your experiment to be meaningful, we need to capture an event that we want to measure, such as a conversion event.

For this tutorial, let's report a conversion event when a clicks a CTA. In server SDKs like Node, this can be called when a specific route is visited or reported from your client side app.

```csharp
posthog.Capture("user_distinct_id", "cta clicked");
```

<Step title="Call feature flag" badge="required">

Use the PostHog SDK to call the experiment flag and update how your page renders based on the assigned variant.

```csharp
if (await posthog.GetFeatureFlagAsync(
        "your-experiment-key",
        "user_distinct_id")
    is { VariantKey: "test" })
{
    // Show test variant UI
} else {
    // Show control variant UI
}
```

Now when a user triggers a `cta clicked` event, PostHog automatically assigns the user to a variant and records an experiment exposure. 

By default, users are split equally between variants. If you want to assign specific users to a specific variant, see more about [distribution and release conditions](/docs/experiments/creating-an-experiment#distribution-and-release-conditions).

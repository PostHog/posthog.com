title: Statistics for trends with counts

Trends experiments for count-based data use a Gamma-Poisson model to evaluate the **win probabilities** and **credible intervals** for an experiment. [Read the statistics primer](/docs/experiments/statistics-primer) for an introduction to Bayesian statistics if you haven't already. Our methodology uses a minimally informative prior of `ALPHA_PRIOR = 1` and `BETA_PRIOR = 1`.

## Win probabilities

The **win probability** tells you how likely it is that a given variant has the highest rate compared to all other variants in the experiment. It helps you determine whether the experiment shows a **statistically significant** real effect vs. simply random chance.

Let's say you're testing a new feature and have these results:
- Control: 100 events from 1000 users (rate of 0.1 events per user)
- Test: 150 events from 1000 users (rate of 0.15 events per user)

To calculate the win probabilities for the experiment, our methodology:

1. Models each variant's rate using a Gamma distribution:
	- Control: Gamma(100 + ALPHA_PRIOR, 1000 + BETA_PRIOR)
	- Test: Gamma(150 + ALPHA_PRIOR, 1000 + BETA_PRIOR)

2. Takes 10,000 random samples from each distribution.

3. Checks which variant had the higher rate for each sample.

4. Calculates the final win probabilities:
	- Control wins in 40 out of 10,000 samples = 0.4% probability
	- Test wins in 9,960 out of 10,000 samples = 99.6% probability

These results tell us we can be 99.6% confident that the test variant performs better than the control.

## Credible intervals

A **credible interval** tells you the range where the true rate lies with 95% probability. Unlike traditional confidence intervals, credible intervals give you a direct probability statement about the rate.

For example, if you have these results:
- Control: 100 events from 1000 users (rate of 0.1 events per user)
- Test: 150 events from 1000 users (rate of 0.15 events per user)

To calculate the credible intervals for the experiment, our methodology will:

1. Create a Gamma distribution for each variant:
	- Control: Gamma(100 + ALPHA_PRIOR, 1000 + BETA_PRIOR)
	- Test: Gamma(150 + ALPHA_PRIOR, 1000 + BETA_PRIOR)

2. Find the 2.5th and 97.5% percentiles of each distribution:
	- Control: [0.082, 0.122] = "You can be 95% confident the true rate is between 0.082 and 0.122 events per user"
	- Test: [0.128, 0.176] = "You can be 95% confident the true rate is between 0.128 and 0.176 events per user"

Since these intervals don't overlap, you can be quite confident that the test variant performs better than the control. The intervals will become narrower as you collect more data, reflecting your increasing certainty about the true rates.

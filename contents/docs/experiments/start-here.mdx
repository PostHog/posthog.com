Experiments enable you to test the impact of product changes and understand how they affect your users' behavior. For example, testing different onboarding flows, app designs, or pricing strategies.

The first step is to install PostHog with the library you want to run experiments in:

<ExperimentInstallationPlatforms columns={3} />

<OSButton variant="primary" asLink to="/docs/experiments/installation">
  Install PostHog SDK
</OSButton>

</QuestLogItem>

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Create your first experiment"
  subtitle="Required"
  icon="IconFlask"
>

Once PostHog is installed, create your experiment by going to the [experiments tab](https://app.posthog.com/experiments) and clicking **New experiment**.

Fill in the experiment details:
- **Feature flag key**: This will be used in your code to check which variant a user gets
- **Variants**: By default, you get `control` and `test` variants (you can add more)
- **Participants**: Choose between user-level or group-level experiments

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Add experiment code"
  subtitle="Required"

With your experiment created, add the code to check which variant users see. Simply fetch the feature flag and customize the experience based on its value:

```js
// Example: Testing a new checkout flow
if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('new-checkout-flow') === 'test') {
    // Show new checkout experience
    showNewCheckout()
} else {
    // Show current checkout (control)
    showCurrentCheckout()
}
```

That's it! When you call `getFeatureFlag()`, PostHog automatically tracks exposures and starts collecting data for your experiment.

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Add metrics"
  subtitle="Required"
  icon="IconGraph"

Before launching, add at least one metric to measure your experiment's success. Go to your experiment and click **Add metric** in the Primary metrics section.

Choose from:
- **Funnel metrics**: For conversion rates (e.g., signup → purchase)
- **Mean metrics**: For averages and sums (e.g., revenue per user)  
- **Ratio metrics**: For custom calculations (e.g., revenue per order)

Once your experiment is running, monitor the results in real-time. PostHog shows:

- **Statistical significance**: Whether your results are reliable
- **Win probability**: The likelihood each variant is better
- **Confidence intervals**: The range of possible effect sizes

When your experiment reaches significance, you can ship the winning variant with confidence using the **Ship a variant** button.

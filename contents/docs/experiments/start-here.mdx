Experiments enable you to test the impact of product changes and understand how they affect your users' behavior. For example, testing different onboarding flows, app designs, or pricing strategies.

The first step is to install PostHog with the library you want to run experiments in (if you haven't already):

<ExperimentInstallationPlatforms />

</QuestLogItem>

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Create your first experiment"
  subtitle="Required"
  icon="IconFlask"
>

Once PostHog is installed, create your experiment by going to the [experiments tab](https://app.posthog.com/experiments) and clicking **New experiment**.

Fill in the experiment details:
- **Feature flag key**: This will be used in your code to check which variant a user gets
- **Variants**: By default, you get `control` and `test` variants (you can add more)
- **Participants**: Choose between user-level or group-level experiments

</QuestLogItem>

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Add your experiment code"
  subtitle="Required"

Next, add code to your app to show different experiences based on the experiment variant. Use the feature flag key from your experiment to check which variant a user has been assigned to:

<ExperimentInstallationPlatforms urlFragment="#call-feature-flag" />

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Server-side experiments" type="info">

For server-side experiments, you may need to manually trigger an exposure event when a user encounters your experiment. This ensures PostHog knows which users have been exposed to which variant. 

[Learn more about exposures](/docs/experiments/exposures) and when manual exposure tracking is needed.

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Add metrics"
  subtitle="Required"
  icon="IconGraph"
>

Before launching, add at least one metric to measure your experiment's success. Go to your experiment and click **Add metric** in the Primary metrics section.

Choose from:
- **Funnel metrics**: For conversion rates (e.g., signup â†’ purchase)
- **Mean metrics**: For averages and sums (e.g., revenue per user)  
- **Ratio metrics**: For custom calculations (e.g., revenue per order)

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Test and launch"
  subtitle="Required"
  icon="IconRocket"
>

Before launching to users, test your experiment to ensure both variants work correctly:

Add an override in your feature flag's [release conditions](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags#release-conditions) to assign yourself to a specific variant (e.g., if your email equals "your-email@company.com", show the test variant). Test both variants to verify they behave as expected.

Once verified, remove the override and launch your experiment to start collecting data!

</QuestLogItem>

<QuestLogItem 
  title="Monitor and analyze results"
  subtitle="Required"
  icon="IconTrendingUp"

Once your experiment is running, monitor the results in real-time. PostHog shows:

- **Statistical significance**: Whether your results are reliable
- **Win probability**: The likelihood each variant is better
- **Confidence intervals**: The range of possible effect sizes

<ProductScreenshot

When your experiment reaches significance, you can ship the winning variant with confidence using the **Ship a variant** button.

Take your experiments to the next level with advanced PostHog features:

### <IconRewindPlay className="text-yellow w-7 -mt-1 inline-block"/> Session replay  
See exactly what users experienced in each variant with session recordings tied to your experiment results.

### <IconToggle className="text-seagreen w-7 -mt-1 inline-block"/> Feature flags
Target specific user segments, implement gradual rollouts, or run experiments on user groups instead of individuals.

### <IconFlask className="text-red w-7 -mt-1 inline-block"/> Advanced experimentation
Choose between Bayesian and frequentist statistical approaches, handle multiple variants, and configure outlier detection.

That's it! You're ready to start running successful experiments.

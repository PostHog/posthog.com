title: Running time
---

The running time calculator provides an accurate estimate of how long your experiment will need to run. It walks you through a few steps:

* **Traffic estimation**: Choose an event to estimate incoming traffic. For example, a pageview event with a specific path or URL filter.

* **Select metric**: Pick one of your added metrics—ideally, your primary success metric—for estimating running time.

* **Minimum detectable effect**: Set the minimum relative change you'd like to detect. Smaller changes require more data and longer run times. A common range is between 5% and 30%, depending on the impact you're trying to measure and your daily user volume.

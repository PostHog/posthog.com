title: Primer for experiment statistics

Experiments use [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics) to determine whether a given **variant** performs better than the **control**. It quantifies **win probabilities** and **credible intervals**, helps determine whether the experiment shows a **statistically significant** effect, and enables you to:

* Check results at any time without statistical penalties.
* Get direct probability statements about which variant is winning.
* Make confident decisions earlier with accumulating evidence.

This contrasts with [Frequentist statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference), which requires you to predefine sample sizes and prevents you from updating probabilities as new data arrives.

## Example Bayesian analysis

Say you started an experiment a few hours ago and see these results:
* 1 in 10 people in the control group complete the funnel = 10% success rate.
* 1 in 9 people in the test variant group complete the funnel = 11% success rate.
* The control variant has a 46.7% probability of being better and the test variant has a 53.3% probability of being better.
* The control variant shows a credible interval of [2.3%, 41.3%] and the test variant shows a credible interval of [2.5%, 44.5%].

Bayesian statistics lets you see the interimediate results (the test variant has a slightly higher success rate), while also giving you detail on the confidence of those results (win probabilities and confidence intervals). Importantly, while the test variant has a slightly higher success rate, the analysis shows you don't have enough data to draw a statistically significant conclusion. 

After you've let the experiment run a bit longer, you see these results:
* 100 in 1000 people in the control group complete the funnel = 10% success rate.
* 100 in 900 people in the test variant group complete the funnel = 11% success rate.
* The control variant has a 21.5% probability of being better and the test variant has a 78.5% probability of being better.
* The control variant shows a credible interval of [8.3%, 12%] and the test variant shows a credible interval of [9.2%, 13.3%].

Et voil√†! The test variant's win probability increased significantly, and the credible intervals became narrower and more distinct. You can decide on the winner now or continue to wait, depending on your business requirements.

## Supported methodologies

Experiments use a few different models depending on the type of data. Read these to understand how Bayesian statistics is applied to each type of experiment:
* [Beta model for funnel experiments](/docs/experiments/funnels-statistics) to analyze conversion rates through multi-step funnels.
* [Gamma-Poisson model for trend experiments with count-based data](/docs/experiments/trends-count-statistics) like pageviews or interaction events.
* [Log-normal model with a Normal-Inverse-Gamma prior for trend experiments with property values](/docs/experiments/trends-property-value-statistics) like revenue.

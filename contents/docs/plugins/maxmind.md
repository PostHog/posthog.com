> **Note:** This is an official PostHog plugin maintained by our core team.

The PostHog MaxMind plugin allows you to enrich your PostHog events with GeoIP data from MaxMind.

Once configured, the plugin adds IP-based location information as properties on your events, such as what country and city your users are located in, making it possible to create charts and tables filtered based on the location of your users.

The plugin adds the following data to events:

- `$city_name`
- `$country_name` 
- `$country_code`
- `$continent_name` 
- `$continent_code` 
- `$postal_code` 
- `$latitude`
- `$longitude`
- `$time_zone`

In addition, it also adds specific subdivision names and codes if available.

> **Note:** This is an official PostHog plugin maintained by our core team.

The PostHog Currency Normalization Plugin converts currency data in events to a normalized currency you choose.

For example, if you have events with currency data that uses both `EUR` and `USD`, the plugin can convert the `EUR` values to `USD` on the event, allowing you to have all your revenue data in a single currency when you perform analytics.

Say hello to Max, your product analyst and assistant living in PostHog.  
Max is an AI sidekick that can:
- research answers to product questions by querying the data,
- get things done quickly in the PostHog UI for you (such as updating filters),
- tell you all about PostHog features and how to use them (based on our docs),
- chit-chat.

## How do I access Max?

To use Max, first personally opt into the PostHog AI beta [in the app's Feature previews](https://us.posthog.com/#panel=feature-previews%3Aartificial-hog).

Once opted in, you can pop Max open wherever you are in PostHog! Just click on "Max" in the top right corner of the app. Then get to chatting.

> First use of Max in the organization requires org admin approval, because PostHog AI features use third-party LLM providers (see details below). In most cases this is just a formality, but we've made it explicit, as we know PostHog customers that strictly limit data subprocessors.

## What access does Max have to my data?

While working with Max, you will certainly share some information with him. Data analysis is a core feature. When doing research, Max can read the following data in your project:

- events, persons, sessions, and data warehouse tables,
- actions and cohorts,
- event and property definitions,
- data warehouse schema.

Based on that context, Max comes up with queries, runs them, and summarizes the results. Those results can be as high-level as a single number, or as detailed as a list of users with all their properties.

## Is my data shared with third parties?

We use third-party LLM providers to power Max, so messages and all data accessed by Max (see list above) is passed through them.
Our LLM providers are:
- OpenAI and Anthropic – responsible for the core of Max's functionality, access to all data types,
- Cohere – responsible for semantic search across PostHog, access to actions and cohorts,
- Perplexity – responsible for providing context about your product and/or company, access to domain name (for websites) or application bundle ID (for mobile applications).

## How can I get Max to remember information?

Max has a memory tied to your project and tries to remember relevant information from your chats naturally. You can also ask him to remember specific details explicitly.

## Beta: integration via LLM

<p>Try our prompt-based integration for {props.framework} using Cursor, Bolt, and other agent-like tools that can run terminal commands. Paste this into your chat:</p>

import AgentPrompt from "../integrate/_snippets/agent-prompt.mdx"

<AgentPrompt />

Or, to integrate manually, continue with the rest of this guide.

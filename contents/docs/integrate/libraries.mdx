PostHog provides a number of both official and community maintained libraries to help you easily integrate with your preferred language or framework.
This document outlines all of our current client-side and server-side libraries, as well as which features each of them currently supports.

For information on how to send events using these libraries, check out [this guide](/docs/integrate/ingest-live-data).

## Client libraries

Some features such as session recording are only available with our JavaScript library.

> We're working to add support for feature flags and autocapture to as many libraries as possible. Please check out the individual library repositories for status on this.

  <summary>Add IPs to Firewall/WAF allowlists (recommended)</summary>

  For certain features like [heatmaps](/docs/toolbar/heatmaps), your Web Application Firewall (WAF) may be blocking PostHog’s requests to your site. Add these IP addresses to your WAF allowlist or rules to let PostHog access your site.

  **EU**: `3.75.65.221`, `18.197.246.42`, `3.120.223.253`
  
  **US**: `44.205.89.55`, `52.4.194.122`, `44.208.188.173`

  These are public, stable IPs used by PostHog services (e.g., Celery tasks for snapshots).

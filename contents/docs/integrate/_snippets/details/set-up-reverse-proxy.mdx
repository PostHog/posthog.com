  <summary>Set up a reverse proxy (recommended)</summary>

We recommend [setting up a reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy), so that events are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers.

We have our [own managed reverse proxy service included in the platform packages](/docs/advanced/proxy/managed-reverse-proxy), which routes through our infrastructure and makes setting up your proxy easy.

If you don't want to use our managed service then there are several other options for creating a reverse proxy, including using [Cloudflare](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudflare), [AWS Cloudfront](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudfront), and [Vercel](/docs/advanced/proxy/vercel).

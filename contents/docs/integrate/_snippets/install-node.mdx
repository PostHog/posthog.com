Run either `npm` or `yarn` in terminal to add it to your project:

```bash
npm install posthog-node --save
# or
yarn add posthog-node
```

In your app, set your project API key **before** making any calls.

```node
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

const client = new PostHog(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    { host: '<ph_instance_address>' } // TIP: You can omit this line if using PostHog Cloud
)

await client.shutdownAsync() // TIP: On program exit, call shutdown to stop pending pollers and flush any remaining events
```

You can find your project API key and instance address in the [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) page in PostHog.

> **Note:** As a rule of thumb, we do not recommend hardcoding API keys. Setting it as an environment variable is preferred.

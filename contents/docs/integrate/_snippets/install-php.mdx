Add the following to `composer.json`:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "posthog/posthog-php": "3.0.*"
    }
}
```
And then install the dependencies with the command:

```bash
php composer.phar install
```

In your app, set your project API key before making any calls.

```php
PostHog::init("<ph_project_api_key>",
  array('host' => '<ph_instance_address>') // TIP: You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com
);
```

> **Note:** As a rule of thumb, we do not recommend having API keys in plaintext. Setting it as an environment variable is best.

You can find your project API key and instance address in the [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) page in PostHog.

Personal API keys enable full access to your account, like an email address and password. You can create multiple and each can be invalidated individually. This improves the security of your PostHog account.

#### How to obtain a personal API key

1. Go to [Account settings](https://app.posthog.com/me/settings)
2. In the 'Personal API Keys' section, click "+ Create a Personal API Key".
3. Give your key a label â€“ this is just for you, usually to describe the key's purpose.
4. At the top of the list, you should see your brand new key. **Immediately** copy its value, as you'll **never** see it again after refreshing the page.

You can create as many keys as you like.

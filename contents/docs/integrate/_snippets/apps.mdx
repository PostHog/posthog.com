## Apps

Apps extend PostHog's functionality and are an incredibly powerful part of the PostHog ecosystem. If you need to bring in data from a 3rd party service or perform some operation on _all_ events coming into PostHog, apps are generally the best and most reliable option.

Apps can help you:

-   Import data from 3rd party services
-   Enrich events in your pipeline by adding extra data
-   Filter events to keep your data clean

### Installation

Below is a list of all our apps for bringing data and events into PostHog. Apps can be installed from the app section in the [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/project/apps).

> This library was built by the community but it's being maintained by the PostHog core team since v1.0.0. Thank you to [Nick Kezhaya](https://github.com/nkezhaya) for building it originally.

The package can be installed by adding `posthog` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:posthog, "~> 1.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Configuration

```elixir file=config/config.exs
config :posthog,
  api_url: "<ph_client_api_host>",
  api_key: "<ph_project_api_key>"

# Optional configurations
config :posthog,
  json_library: Jason,   # Default JSON parser (optional)
  enabled_capture: true, # Enable/disable PostHog tracking (optional, defaults to true)
  http_client: Posthog.HTTPClient.Hackney,  # Default HTTP client (optional)
  http_client_opts: [    # HTTP client options (optional)
    timeout: 5_000,      # Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 5_000)
    retries: 3,          # Number of retries on failure (default: 3)
    retry_delay: 1_000   # Delay between retries in milliseconds (default: 1_000)
  ]
```

#### Advanced configuration

The default JSON parser is `Jason` but you can pass in a custom JSON library via the `json_library` config.

The default HTTP client is `Hackney` but you can pass in a custom HTTP client via the `http_client` config. This client should implement the `Posthog.HTTPClient` behaviour. For testing purposes, you'll likely want a mock HTTP client implementation.

You can refer to the library's [README.md](https://github.com/posthog/posthog-elixir) for more information on the advanced configuration options.

#### Development/Test mode

If you are running in development or test mode, you can pass in a `enabled_capture: false` value to the config. This causes events to be dropped instead of sent to PostHog.

```elixir file=config/test.exs
config :posthog,
  enabled_capture: false # Disable tracking in test mode
```

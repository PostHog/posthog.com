> This library was built by the community but it's being maintained by the PostHog core team since v1.0.0. Thank you to [Nick Kezhaya](https://github.com/nkezhaya) for building it originally. Thank you to [Alex Martsinovich](https://github.com/martosaur) for contributing v2.0.0.

The package can be installed by adding `posthog` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:posthog, "~> 2.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Configuration

```elixir file=config/config.exs
config :posthog,
  enable: true,
  api_host: "<ph_client_api_host>",
  api_key: "<ph_project_api_key>",
  in_app_otp_apps: [:my_app]
```

You can see all the available configuration options in the [PostHog.Config](https://hexdocs.pm/posthog/PostHog.Config.html) module.

Optionally, you might wanna enable the [Plug integration](https://hexdocs.pm/posthog/PostHog.Integrations.Plug.html) to automatically capture events from your Plug-based applications - including Phoenix.


#### Development/Test mode

For a test environment, you can pass in `test_mode: true` value to the config. This causes events to be dropped instead of sent to PostHog.

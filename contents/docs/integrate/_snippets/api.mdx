Events can be ingested directly using our API and the [`/capture`](/docs/api/post-only-endpoints#capture) endpoint, which is the same endpoint that all of our libraries use behind the scenes.

Generally, this isn't something you'll need to use when integrating PostHog, but if you're working with a language or framework that PostHog doesn't support yet, this will allow you to still send events.


> **Note:** For this API, you should use your 'Project API Key' from the 'Project' page in PostHog. This is the same key used in your frontend snippet.

# Sending events

Events can be sent either one at a time, or together in a batch. There is no limit on the number of events you can send in a batch, but the entire request body must be less than `20MB` by default.

<MultiLanguage>

```shell label=Single
POST https://[your-instance].com/capture/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "event_name",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "distinct_id_of_your_user",
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    },
    "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
}
```

```shell label=Batch
POST https://[your-instance].com/batch/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "batch": [
        {
            "event": "event_name",
            "properties": {
                "distinct_id": "distinct_id_of_your_user",
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
            },
            "timestamp": "[optional timestamp in ISO 8601 format]"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
</MultiLanguage>

> **Note:** Timestamp is optional. If not set, it'll automatically be set to the current time.

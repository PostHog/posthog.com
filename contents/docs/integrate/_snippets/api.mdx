## API

Events can also be ingested directly using our API and the [`/capture`](/docs/api/post-only-endpoints#capture) endpoint, which is the same endpoint that all of our libraries use behind the scenes.

Generally, this isn't something you'll need to use when integrating PostHog, but if you're working with a language or framework that PostHog doesn't support yet, this will allow you to still send events.

For more information, read our [API docs](/docs/api/post-only-endpoints).

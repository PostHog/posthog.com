import Snippet from "./install-js-snippet.mdx"

### Option 1: Add the JavaScript snippet to your HTML <span class="bg-gray-accent-light dark:bg-gray-accent-dark text-gray font-semibold align-middle text-sm p-1 rounded">Recommended</span>

<Snippet />

### Option 2: Install via package manager

<MultiLanguage>

```bash file=Yarn
yarn add posthog-js
```

```bash file=NPM
npm install --save posthog-js
```

</MultiLanguage>

And then include it in your files:

```js-web
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>' })
```

If you don't want to send test data while you're developing, you can do the following:

```js-web
if (!window.location.host.includes('127.0.0.1') && !window.location.host.includes('localhost')) {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>' })
}
```

<details>
<summary>Bundle all required extensions (advanced)</summary>

By default, the JavaScript Web library will only load the core functionality. It lazy-loads extensions such as surveys or the session replay 'recorder' when needed. 

This can cause issues if you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline scripts or if you want to optimize your bundle at build time to ensure all dependencies are ready immediately. In addition, environments like the Chrome Extension store will reject code that loads remote code. To solve this issue, we have multiple import options available below.

> **Note:** With any of the `no-external` options, the toolbar will be unavailable as this is only possible as a runtime dependency loaded directly from `us.posthog.com`.

```js-web
// No external code loading possible (this disables all extensions such as Replay, Surveys, Exceptions etc.)
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.no-external'

// No external code loading possible but all external dependencies pre-bundled
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.full.no-external'

// All external dependencies pre-bundled and with the ability to load external scripts (primarily useful is you use Site Apps)
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.full'

// Finally you can also import specific extra dependencies 
import "posthog-js/dist/recorder"
import "posthog-js/dist/surveys"
import "posthog-js/dist/exception-autocapture"
import "posthog-js/dist/tracing-headers"
import "posthog-js/dist/web-vitals"
import posthog from 'posthog-js/dist/module.no-external'

// All other posthog commands are the same as usual
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>' })
```

> **Note:** You should ensure if using this option that you always import `posthog-js` from the same module, otherwise multiple bundles could get included. At this time `posthog-js/react` does not work with any module import other than the default.

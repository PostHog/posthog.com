PostHog is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or you can add it as a Swift Package Manager based dependency.

### CocoaPods

pod "PostHog", "~> 1.1"
```

### Carthage

```ruby file=Cartfile
github "posthog/posthog-ios"

### Swift Package Manager

Add PostHog as a dependency in your Xcode project "Package Dependencies" and select the project target for your app, as appropriate.

For a Swift Package Manager based project, add PostHog as a dependency in your "Package.swift" file's Package dependencies section:

```swift file=Package.swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios.git", from: "2.0.0")
],
```

and then as a dependency for the Package target utilizing PostHog:

```swift
  .target(
    name: "myApp",
    dependencies: [.product(name: "PostHog", package: "posthog-ios")]),
```

### Configuration

#### With Objective-C

```objectivec
#import <PostHog/PHGPostHog.h>
#import <PostHog/PHGPostHogConfiguration.h>

// on posthog.com
PHGPostHogConfiguration *configuration = [PHGPostHogConfiguration configurationWithApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY"];

// self-hosted
PHGPostHogConfiguration *configuration = [PHGPostHogConfiguration configurationWithApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY" 
                                                                          host:@"https://app.posthog.com"];

configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = YES; // Record certain application events automatically!
configuration.recordScreenViews = YES; // Record screen views automatically!

[PHGPostHog setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
```

#### With Swift

```swift
import PostHog

// `host` is optional if you use PostHog Cloud (app.posthog.com)
let configuration = PHGPostHogConfiguration(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_instance_address>")

configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = true; // Record certain application events automatically!
configuration.recordScreenViews = true; // Record screen views automatically!

PHGPostHog.setup(with: configuration)
let posthog = PHGPostHog.shared()
```

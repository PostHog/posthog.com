PostHog is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) or you can add it as a Swift Package Manager based dependency.

### CocoaPods

```ruby file=Podfile
pod "PostHog", "~> 3.0.0"
```

### Swift Package Manager

Add PostHog as a dependency in your Xcode project "Package Dependencies" and select the project target for your app, as appropriate.

For a Swift Package Manager based project, add PostHog as a dependency in your "Package.swift" file's Package dependencies section:

```swift file=Package.swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios.git", from: "3.0.0")
],
```

and then as a dependency for the Package target utilizing PostHog:

```swift
  .target(
    name: "myApp",
    dependencies: [.product(name: "PostHog", package: "posthog-ios")]),
```

### Configuration

```swift
import Foundation
import PostHog
import UIKit

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        let POSTHOG_API_KEY = "<ph_project_api_key>"
        // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
        let POSTHOG_HOST = "<ph_instance_address>"

        let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: POSTHOG_API_KEY, host: POSTHOG_HOST) // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
        PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)

        return true
    }
}
```

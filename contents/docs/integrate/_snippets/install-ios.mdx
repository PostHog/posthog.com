Add PostHog as a dependency in your Xcode project "Package Dependencies" and select the project target for your app, as appropriate.

For a Swift Package Manager based project, add PostHog as a dependency in your "Package.swift" file's Package dependencies section:

```swift file=Package.swift

  .package(url: "https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios.git", from: "2.0.0")
],
```

and then as a dependency for the Package target utilizing PostHog:

```swift

    name: "myApp",
    dependencies: [.product(name: "PostHog", package: "posthog-ios")]),
```

### Configuration

#### With Objective-C

```objectivec
#import <PostHog/PHGPostHog.h>
#import <PostHog/PHGPostHogConfiguration.h>

// cloud-hosted
PHGPostHogConfiguration *configuration = [PHGPostHogConfiguration configurationWithApiKey:@"<ph_project_api_key>"];

// self-hosted
PHGPostHogConfiguration *configuration = [PHGPostHogConfiguration configurationWithApiKey:@"<ph_project_api_key>" 
                                                                          host:@"https://your-posthog-domain.com"];

configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = YES; // Record certain application events automatically!
configuration.recordScreenViews = YES; // Record screen views automatically!

[PHGPostHog setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
```

#### With Swift

```swift
import PostHog

let configuration = PHGPostHogConfiguration(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_instance_address>") // TIP: `host` is optional if you use app.posthog.com

configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = true; // Record certain application events automatically!
configuration.recordScreenViews = true; // Record screen views automatically!

PHGPostHog.setup(with: configuration)
let posthog = PHGPostHog.shared()
```

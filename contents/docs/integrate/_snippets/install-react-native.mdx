In your React Native or Expo project add the `posthog-react-native` package to your project as well as the required peer dependencies.

#### Expo apps

```sh
npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
```

#### React Native apps

```sh
yarn add posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
# or
npm i -s posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
```

#### React Native Web and macOS

If you're using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) or [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), do not use the [expo-file-system](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system) package since the Web and macOS targets aren't supported, use the [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) package instead.

### Configuration

#### With the PosthogProvider

The recommended way to set up PostHog for React Native is to use the `PostHogProvider` which utilizes the Context API to pass the PostHog client around, enable autocapture, and ensure that the queue is flushed at the right time:

```react-native
// App.(js|ts)
import { usePostHog, PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
...

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" options={{
            // usually 'https://app.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.posthog.com'
            host: '<ph_instance_address>', // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
        }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </PostHogProvider>
    )
}

// Now you can simply access PostHog elsewhere in the app like so:

const MyComponent = () => {
    const posthog = usePostHog()

    useEffect(() => {
        posthog.capture("mycomponent_loaded", { foo: "bar" })
    }, [])
}
```

#### Without the PosthogProvider


```react-native
// posthog.ts
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

export const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // usually 'https://app.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.posthog.com'  
  host: '<ph_instance_address>' // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
})


// app.ts
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp1() {
    useEffect(async () => {
        posthog.capture('myapp1_loaded')
    }, [])

    return <View>Your app code</View>
}


// You can even use this instance with the PostHogProvider
export function MyApp2() {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{/* Your app code */}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

### Configuration options

You can further customize how PostHog works through its configuration on initialization.

```ts
export const posthog = new PostHog("<ph_project_api_key>", {
    /** PostHog API host (usually 'https://app.posthog.com' by default or 'https://eu.posthog.com') */
    host?: string, // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
    /** The number of events to queue before sending to PostHog (flushing) */
    flushAt?: number = 20,
    /** The interval in milliseconds between periodic flushes */
    flushInterval?: number = 10000,
    /** If set to true the SDK is essentially disabled (useful for local environments where you don't want to track anything) */
    disabled?: boolean,
    /** If set to false the SDK will not track until the 'optIn' function is called. */
    defaultOptIn?: boolean = true,
    /** Whether to track that 'getFeatureFlag' was called (used by Experiments) */
    sendFeatureFlagEvent?: boolean = true,
    /** Whether to load feature flags when initialized or not */
    preloadFeatureFlags?: boolean = true,
    /** Option to bootstrap the library with given distinctId and feature flags */
    bootstrap?: {
        distinctId?: string
        isIdentifiedId?: boolean
        featureFlags?: Record<string, boolean | string>
        featureFlagPayloads?: Record<string, JsonType>
    },
    /** How many times we will retry HTTP requests */
    fetchRetryCount?: number = 3,
    /** The delay between HTTP request retries */
    fetchRetryDelay?: number = 3000,
    /** Timeout in milliseconds for any calls. Defaults to 10 seconds. */
    requestTimeout?: number = 10000,
    /** For Session Analysis how long before we expire a session (defaults to 30 mins) */
    sessionExpirationTimeSeconds?: number = 1800,
    /** Whether to post events to PostHog in JSON or compressed format. Defaults to 'form' */
    captureMode?: 'json' | 'form',
    /** Allows you to provide the storage type. By default 'file'.
     * 'file' will try to load the best available storage, the provided 'customStorage', 'customAsyncStorage' or in-memory storage.
     */
    persistence?: 'memory' | 'file',
    /** Allows you to provide your own implementation of the common information about your App or a function to modify the default App properties generated */
    customAppProperties?:
      | PostHogCustomAppProperties
      | ((properties: PostHogCustomAppProperties) => PostHogCustomAppProperties),
    /** Allows you to provide a custom asynchronous storage such as async-storage, expo-file-system or a synchronous storage such as mmkv.
     * If not provided, PostHog will attempt to use the best available storage via optional peer dependencies (async-storage, expo-file-system).
     * If 'persistence' is set to 'memory', this option will be ignored.
     */
    customStorage?: PostHogCustomStorage,
    /** Captures native app lifecycle events such as Application Installed, Application Updated, Application Opened, Application Became Active and Application Backgrounded.
     * By default is false.
     * If you're already using the 'captureLifecycleEvents' options with 'withReactNativeNavigation' or 'PostHogProvider, you should not set this to true, otherwise you may see duplicated events.
     */
    captureNativeAppLifecycleEvents?: boolean = false
})
```

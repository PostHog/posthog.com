In your React Native or Expo project add the `posthog-react-native` package to your project as well as the required peer dependencies.

#### Expo apps

```sh
npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
```

#### React Native apps

```sh
yarn add posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
# or
npm i -s posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
```

#### React Native Web and macOS

If you're using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) or [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), do not use the [expo-file-system](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system) package since the Web and macOS targets aren't supported, use the [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) package instead.

### Configuration

#### With the PosthogProvider

The recommended way to set up PostHog for React Native is to use the `PostHogProvider` which utilizes the Context API to pass the PostHog client around, enable autocapture, and ensure that the queue is flushed at the right time:

```react-native
// App.(js|ts)
import { usePostHog, PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
...

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" options={{
            // usually 'https://app.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.posthog.com'
            host: '<ph_instance_address>', // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
        }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </PostHogProvider>
    )
}

// Now you can simply access PostHog elsewhere in the app like so:

const MyComponent = () => {
    const posthog = usePostHog()

    useEffect(() => {
        posthog?.capture("mycomponent_loaded", { foo: "bar" })
    }, [])
}
```

### Configuration

#### Without the PosthogProvider

Due to the async nature of React Native, PostHog needs to be initialized asynchronously for the persisted state to load properly. The `PosthogProvider` takes care of this under-the-hood but you can alternatively create the instance yourself like so:

```react-native
// posthog.ts
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

export let posthog: PostHog | undefined = undefined

export const posthogAsync: Promise<PostHog> = PostHog.initAsync('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // usually 'https://app.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.posthog.com'  
  host: '<ph_instance_address>' // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
})

posthogAsync.then(client => {
  posthog = client
})


// app.ts
import { posthog, posthogAsync} from './posthog'

export function MyApp1() {
    useEffect(async () => {
        // Use posthog optionally with the possibility that it may still be loading
        posthog?.capture('myapp1_loaded')
        // OR use posthog via the promise
        (await posthogAsync).capture('myapp1_loaded')
    }, [])

    return <View>Your app code</View>
}


// You can even use this instance with the PostHogProvider
export function MyApp2() {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthogAsync}>{/* Your app code */}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

### Configuration options

You can further customize how PostHog works through its configuration on initialization.

```ts
export const posthog = await PostHog.initAsync("<ph_project_api_key>", {
    // PostHog API host, usually 'https://app.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.posthog.com'
    host?: string = "<ph_instance_address>", // TIP: host is optional if you use https://app.posthog.com
    // The number of events to queue before sending to PostHog (flushing)
    flushAt?: number = 20,
    // The interval in milliseconds between periodic flushes
    flushInterval?: number = 10000
    // If set to false, tracking will be disabled until 'optIn' is called
    enable?: boolean = true,
    // Whether to track that 'getFeatureFlag' was called (used by Experiments)
    sendFeatureFlagEvent?: boolean = true,
    // Whether to load feature flags when initialised or not
    preloadFeatureFlags?: boolean = true,
    // How many times we will retry HTTP requests
    fetchRetryCount?: number = 3,
    // The delay between HTTP request retries
    fetchRetryDelay?: number = 3000,
    // For Session Analysis how long before we expire a session
    sessionExpirationTimeSeconds?: number = 1800 // 30 mins
    // Whether to post events to PostHog in JSON or compressed format
    captureMode?: 'json' | 'form'
})
```

Our React Native enables you to integrate PostHog with your React Native project. For React Native projects built with Expo, there are no mobile native dependencies outside of supported Expo packages.

To install, add the `posthog-react-native` package to your project as well as the required peer dependencies.

#### Expo apps

```bash
npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
```

#### React Native apps

```bash
yarn add posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
# or
npm i -s posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
```

#### React Native Web and macOS

If you're using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) or [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), do not use the [expo-file-system](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system) package since the Web and macOS targets aren't supported, use the [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) package instead.

### Configuration

#### With the PosthogProvider

The recommended way to set up PostHog for React Native is to use the `PostHogProvider`. This utilizes the Context API to pass the PostHog client around, enable [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), and ensure that the queue is flushed at the right time.

To set up `PostHogProvider`, add it to your `App.js` or `App.ts` file:

```react-native file=App.js
// App.(js|ts)
import { usePostHog, PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
...

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" options={{
            // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
            host: '<ph_client_api_host>', // TIP: host is optional if you use https://us.i.posthog.com
        }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </PostHogProvider>
    )
}
```

Then you can access PostHog using the `usePostHog()` hook:

```react-native
const MyComponent = () => {
    const posthog = usePostHog()

    useEffect(() => {
        posthog.capture("event_name")
    }, [posthog])
}
```

#### Without the PosthogProvider

If you prefer not to use the provider, you can initialize PostHog in its own file and import the instance from there:

```react-native file=posthog.ts
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

export const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'  
  host: '<ph_client_api_host>' // TIP: host is optional if you use https://us.i.posthog.com
})
```

Then you can access PostHog by importing your instance:

```react-native
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp1() {
    useEffect(async () => {
        posthog.capture('event_name')
    }, [posthog])

    return <View>Your app code</View>
}
```

You can even use this instance with the PostHogProvider:

```react-native
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp() {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{/* Your app code */}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

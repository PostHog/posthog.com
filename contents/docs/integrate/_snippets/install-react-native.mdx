In your React Native or Expo project add the `posthog-react-native` package to your project as well as the required peer dependencies.

#### Expo apps

```sh
npx expo install posthog-react-native expo-file-system expo-application expo-device expo-localization
```

#### React Native apps

```sh
yarn add posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
# or
npm i -s posthog-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
```

#### React Native Web and macOS

If you're using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) or [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), do not use the [expo-file-system](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-file-system) package since the Web and macOS targets aren't supported, use the [@react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) package instead.

### Configuration

#### With the PosthogProvider

The recommended way to set up PostHog for React Native is to use the `PostHogProvider`. This utilizes the Context API to pass the PostHog client around, enable [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), and ensure that the queue is flushed at the right time.

To set up `PostHogProvider`, add it to your `App.js` or `App.ts` file:

```react-native file=App.js
// App.(js|ts)
import { usePostHog, PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
...

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" options={{
            // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
            host: '<ph_client_api_host>', // TIP: host is optional if you use https://us.i.posthog.com
        }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </PostHogProvider>
    )
}
```

Then you can access PostHog using the `usePostHog()` hook:

```react-native
const MyComponent = () => {
    const posthog = usePostHog()

    useEffect(() => {
        posthog.capture("event_name")
    }, [posthog])
}
```

#### Without the PosthogProvider

If you prefer not to use the provider, you can initialize PostHog in it's own file and import the instance from there:

```react-native file=posthog.ts
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

export const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'  
  host: '<ph_client_api_host>' // TIP: host is optional if you use https://us.i.posthog.com
})
```

Then you can access PostHog by importing your instance:

```react-native
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp1() {
    useEffect(async () => {
        posthog.capture('event_name')
    }, [posthog])

    return <View>Your app code</View>
}
```

You can even use this instance with the PostHogProvider:

```
import { posthog } from './posthog'

export function MyApp() {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{/* Your app code */}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

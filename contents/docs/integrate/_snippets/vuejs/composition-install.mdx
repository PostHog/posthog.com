We use the Composition API as it provides better accessibility, maintainability, and type safety.

Start by creating a `composables` folder as well as a `usePosthog.js` file to that folder. In `usePosthog.js`, initialize PostHog as a composable with your project API key and host. You can find these in your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/settings). Also, make sure to set `capture_pageview` to `history_change` because Vue acts as a single-page app and doesn't fire the page load events PostHog usually relies to capture pageviews.

```js
// src/composables/usePostHog.ts
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

export function usePostHog() {
  posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    capture_pageview: 'history_change'
  })

  return {
    posthog
  }
}
```

Next, in `router/index.js`, import the `usePostHog` composable and call it.

```js
// src/router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import HomeView from '../views/HomeView.vue'
import { usePostHog } from '@/composables/usePostHog'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL),
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      name: 'home',
      component: HomeView,
    },
    {
      path: '/about',
      name: 'about',
      component: () => import('../views/AboutView.vue'),
    },
  ],
})

const { posthog } = usePostHog()

export default router
```

Once done, PostHog will begin [autocapturing](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) events and pageviews (if enabled) and is ready to use throughout your app.

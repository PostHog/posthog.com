import Snippet from "../snippet.mdx"

This is the simplest way to get PostHog up and running. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet below and replace `<ph_project_api_key>` and `<ph_client_api_host>` with your project's values, then add it within the `<head>` tags at the base of your product - ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag. This ensures PostHog loads on any page users visit.

You can find the snippet pre-filled with this data in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet).

Once the snippet is added, PostHog automatically captures `$pageview` and [other events](/docs/data/autocapture) like button clicks. You can then enable other products, such as session replays, within [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings).

  <summary>Set up a reverse proxy (recommended)</summary>

  We recommend setting up a reverse proxy so that events are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers. We have our [own managed reverse proxy service included in the Teams plan](/docs/advanced/proxy/managed-reverse-proxy), which routes through our infrastructure and makes setting up your proxy easy.

  If you don't want to use our managed service then there are several other [options for creating a reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy), including using [Cloudflare](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudflare), [AWS Cloudfront](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudfront), and [Vercel](/docs/advanced/proxy/vercel).

  <summary>Include ES5 support (optional)</summary>

  If you need ES5 support for example to track Internet Explorer 11 replace `/static/array.js` in the snippet with `/static/array.full.es5.js`

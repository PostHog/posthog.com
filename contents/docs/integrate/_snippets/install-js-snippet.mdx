import Snippet from "../snippet.mdx"

This is the simplest way to get PostHog up and running. It only takes a few minutes.

#### Add to your website and product

Copy the snippet below and replace `<ph_project_api_key>` and `<ph_instance_address>` with your project's values, then add it within the `<head>` tags of your product - ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag - on pages you want to track. 

You can find the snippet pre-filled with this data in [your project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

<Snippet />

Once the snippet has been added PostHog will automatically track `$pageview` and [other events](/docs/data/autocapture). You can then enable other products, such as session replays, within [your project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

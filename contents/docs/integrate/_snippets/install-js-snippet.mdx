This is the simplest way to get PostHog up and running. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet below and replace `<ph_project_api_key>` and `<ph_client_api_host>` with your project's values, then add it within the `<head>` tags at the base of your product - ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag. This ensures PostHog loads on any page users visit.

You can find the snippet pre-filled with this data in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet).

Once the snippet is added, PostHog automatically captures `$pageview` and [other events](/docs/data/autocapture) like button clicks. You can then enable other products, such as session replays, within [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings).

  <summary>Include ES5 support (optional)</summary>

  If you need ES5 support for example to track Internet Explorer 11 replace `/static/array.js` in the snippet with `/static/array.full.es5.js`

  <summary>Working with AI code editors?</summary>

  If you’re working with AI code editors (like Lovable, Bolt.new, Replit, and others), it’s easy to install PostHog. All you have to do is ask (seriously). Specifically: in your tool, type a prompt like this: “I’d like to use PostHog to track events here; here is my install snippet.” Paste in your snippet. The tool will do the rest.

As of this time, some web-based AI builders (such as artifacts by Claude) don’t support access to external JS libraries. You’ll be able to ask it to use a placeholder, and then update it manually when you deploy to production.

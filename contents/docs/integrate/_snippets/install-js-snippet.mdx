import Snippet from "../snippet.mdx"

> This is the simplest way to get PostHog up and running on your website, and only takes a few minutes to set-up.

#### Add to your website &amp; app

Paste this snippet within the `<head>` tags of your website - ideally just inside the closing `</head>` tag - on all pages that you wish to track.

<Snippet />

Be sure to replace `<ph_project_api_key>` and `<ph_instance_address>` with your project's values. (You can find the snippet pre-filled with this data in the PostHog app under Project / Settings. _(Quick links if you use [PostHog Cloud US](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/project/settings))_

#### What this code does

After adding the snippet to your website, it will automatically start to:

-   Capture `$pageview` events when a user visits a page
-   Track when users [click on links or buttons](/docs/data/autocapture)
-   [Record videos of user sessions](/docs/user-guides/recordings) that you can play back (if you've enabled the Session recordings feature, which we highly recommend!)

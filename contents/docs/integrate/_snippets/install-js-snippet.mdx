This is the simplest way to get PostHog up and running. It only takes a few minutes.

Copy the snippet below and replace `<ph_project_api_key>` and `<ph_client_api_host>` with your project's values, then add it within the `<head>` tags at the base of your product - ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag. This ensures PostHog loads on any page users visit.

You can find the snippet pre-filled with this data in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet).

<Snippet />

Once the snippet is added, PostHog automatically captures `$pageview` and [other events](/docs/data/autocapture) like button clicks. You can then enable other products, such as session replays, within [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings). 

### ES5 Support

If you need ES5 support for example to track Internet Explorer 11 replace `/static/array.js` in the snippet with `/static/array.full.es5.js`

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
npm install @capawesome/capacitor-posthog posthog-js
```

After installing the package, you need to update your Capacitor project:

```bash
npx cap update
```

### Configuration

To use the plugin, you need to call the `setup(...)` method with your PostHog project API key and host which you can find in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project):

```ts
import { Posthog } from '@capawesome/capacitor-posthog';

const setup = async () => {
  await Posthog.setup({
    apiKey: '<ph_project_api_key>',
    host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
  });
};
```

You pass in a `host` key to specify the PostHog instance you want to send events to. The default host is `https://us.i.posthog.com`.

Run the following command to install the package:

```
npm install @capawesome/capacitor-posthog posthog-js
```

After installing the package, you need to update your Capacitor project:

```
npx cap update
```

### Configuration

To use the plugin, you need to call the `setup(...)` method with your PostHog project API key and host which you can find in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project):

```typescript
import { Posthog } from '@capawesome/capacitor-posthog';

const setup = async () => {
  await Posthog.setup({
    apiKey: '<ph_project_api_key>',
    host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
  });
};
```

The `host` key is optional and defaults to `https://us.i.posthog.com`. For more configuration options, see our [JavaScript Web docs](/docs/libraries/js#config).

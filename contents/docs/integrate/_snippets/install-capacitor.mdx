Run the following command to install the package:

```
npm install @capawesome/capacitor-posthog posthog-js
```

After installing the package, you need to update your Capacitor project:

```
npx cap update
```

### Configuration

To use the plugin, you need to call the `setup(...)` method with your PostHog project API key and host which you can find in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project):

```typescript
import { Posthog } from '@capawesome/capacitor-posthog';

const setup = async () => {
  await Posthog.setup({
    apiKey: 'phc_g8wMenebiIQ1pYd5v9Vy7oakn6MczVKIsNG5ZHCspdy',
    host: 'https://eu.i.posthog.com',
  });
};
```

You can also pass in a `host` key to specify the PostHog instance you want to send events to. The default host is `https://us.i.posthog.com`.

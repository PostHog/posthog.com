The best way to install the PostHog Android library is with a build system like 
Gradle. This ensures you can easily upgrade to the latest versions. 

All you need to do is add the `posthog` module to your `build.gradle`:

```bash
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.posthog.android:posthog:1.+'
}
```

### Configuration

The best place to initialize the client is in your `Application` subclass.

```java
public class SampleApp extends Application {
  private static final String POSTHOG_API_KEY = "<ph_project_api_key>";
  private static final String POSTHOG_HOST = "<ph_instance_address>";

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    // Create a PostHog client with the given context, API key and host.
    PostHog posthog = new PostHog.Builder(this, POSTHOG_API_KEY, POSTHOG_HOST)
      .captureApplicationLifecycleEvents() // Record certain application events automatically!
      .recordScreenViews() // Record screen views automatically!
      .build();

    // Set the initialized instance as a globally accessible instance.
    PostHog.setSingletonInstance(posthog);

    // Now anytime you call PostHog.with, the custom instance will be returned.
    PostHog posthog = PostHog.with(this);
  }
}
```

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Upgrading to v6" type="fyi">

Version `6.x` of the PostHog Python SDK introduces a new [contexts](/docs/libraries/python#contexts) API and breaking changes. If you're upgrading from `5.x` to `6.x`, read the [migration guide](/tutorials/python-v6-migration) first to learn more.

In your app, import the `posthog` library and set your project API key and host **before** making any calls.

```python
from posthog import Posthog

posthog = Posthog('<ph_project_api_key>', host='<ph_client_api_host>')
```

> **Note:** As a rule of thumb, we do not recommend having API keys in plaintext. Setting it as an environment variable is best.

You can find your project API key and instance address in the [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) page in PostHog.

To debug, you can toggle debug mode:

```python
posthog.debug = True
```

To make sure no calls happen during tests, you can disable PostHog, like so:

```python
if settings.TEST:
    posthog.disabled = True
```

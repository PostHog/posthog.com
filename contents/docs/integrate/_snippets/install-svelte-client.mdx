Install `posthog-js` using your package manager:

```bash
yarn add posthog-js
# or
npm install --save posthog-js
```

Then, if you haven't created a root [layout](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#layout) already, create a new file called `+layout.js` in your `src/routes` folder In this file, check the environment is the browser, and initialize PostHog if so. You can get both your API key and instance address in your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/settings). Also, make sure to set `capture_pageview` to `history_change` because Svelte acts as a single-page app and doesn't fire the page load events PostHog usually relies to capture pageviews.

```js file=routes/+layout.js
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { browser } from '$app/environment';

export const load = async () => {
  if (browser) {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
      api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
      defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
    })
  }

  return
};
```

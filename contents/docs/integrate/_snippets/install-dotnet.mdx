At the moment, ASP.NET Core is the only supported platform for the PostHog .NET SDK. However, we do have experimental support for other platforms mentioned later in this document.

```bash
dotnet add package PostHog.AspNetCore
```

In your `Program.cs` file, add the following code:

```csharp
using PostHog;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add PostHog to the dependency injection container as a singleton.
builder.AddPostHog();
```

Make sure to configure PostHog with your project API key, instance address, and optional personal API key. For example, in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "PostHog": {
    "ProjectApiKey": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "Host": "<ph_client_api_host>"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If the host is not specified, the default host `https://us.i.posthog.com` is used.

Use a secrets manager to store your personal API key. For example, when developing locally you can use the `UserSecrets` feature of the `dotnet` CLI:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "PostHog:PersonalApiKey" "phc_..."
```

You can find your project API key and instance address in the [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) page in PostHog.

To see detailed logging, set the log level to `Debug` or `Trace` in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "PostHog": "Trace"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## Experimental support for other platforms

The PostHog package is multi-targeted to support `net8.0` and `dotnetstandard2.1`. This means it can be used in a wider range of projects than just ASP.NET Core. However, this support is experimental and not officially supported.

If you are using a different platform, you can install the `PostHog` package instead of `PostHog.AspNetCore`. This package does not depend on ASP.NET Core and can be used in any .NET project.

```bash
dotnet add package PostHog
```

The `PostHogClient` class must be implemented as a singleton in your project. For PostHog.AspNetCore, this is handled by the `builder.AddPostHog();` method. For the `PostHog` package, you can do the following if you're using dependency injection:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IPostHogClient, PostHogClient>();
```

If you're not using dependency injection, you can create a static instance of the `PostHogClient` class and use that everywhere in your project:

```csharp
using PostHog;

public static readonly PostHogClient PostHog = new(new PostHogOptions {
    ProjectApiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>",
    HostUrl = new Uri("<ph_client_api_host>"),
    PersonalApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(
      "PostHog__PersonalApiKey")
});
```

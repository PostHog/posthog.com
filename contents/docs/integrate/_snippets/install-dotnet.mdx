At the moment, ASP.NET Core is the only supported platform for the PostHog .NET SDK.

```bash
dotnet add package PostHog.AspNetCore
```

In your `Program.cs` file, add the following code:

```csharp
using PostHog.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddPostHog();
```

Make sure to configure PostHog with your project API key, instance address, and optional personal API key. For example, in appsettings.json:

```json
{
  "PostHog": {
    "ProjectApiKey": "phc_...",
    "Host": "https://us.i.posthog.com"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If the host is not specified, the default host `https://us.i.posthog.com` is used.

Use a secrets manager to store your personal API key. For example, when developing locally you can use the `UserSecrets` feature of the `dotnet` CLI:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "PostHog:PersonalApiKey" "phc_..."
```

You can find your project API key and instance address in the [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) page in PostHog.

To see detailed logging, set the log level to `Debug` or `Trace` in appsettings.json:

```json
{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "PostHog": "Trace"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

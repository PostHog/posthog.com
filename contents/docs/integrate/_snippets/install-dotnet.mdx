At the moment, ASP.NET Core is the only supported platform for the PostHog .NET SDK. However, we do have experimental support for other platforms mentioned later in this document.

```bash
dotnet add package PostHog.AspNetCore
```

In your `Program.cs` (or `Startup.cs` for ASP.NET Core 2.x) file, add the following code:

```csharp
using PostHog;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add PostHog to the dependency injection container as a singleton.
builder.AddPostHog();
```

Make sure to configure PostHog with your project API key, instance address, and optional personal API key. For example, in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "PostHog": {
    "ProjectApiKey": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "HostUrl": "<ph_client_api_host>"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If the host is not specified, the default host `https://us.i.posthog.com` is used.

Use a secrets manager to store your personal API key. For example, when developing locally you can use the `UserSecrets` feature of the `dotnet` CLI:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "PostHog:PersonalApiKey" "phc_..."
```

You can find your project API key and instance address in the [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) page in PostHog.

To see detailed logging, set the log level to `Debug` or `Trace` in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "DetailedErrors": true,
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "PostHog": "Trace"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## Working with .NET Feature Management

`PostHog.AspNetCore` supports [.NET Feature Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/feature-management-dotnet-reference). This enables you to use the &lt;feature /&gt; tag helper and the `FeatureGateAttribute` in your ASP.NET Core applications to gate access to certain features using PostHog feature flags.

To use feature flags with the .NET Feature Management library, you'll need to implement the `IPostHogFeatureFlagContextProvider` interface. The quickest way to do that is to inherit from the `PostHogFeatureFlagContextProvider` class and override the `GetDistinctId` and `GetFeatureFlagOptionsAsync` methods.

```csharp
public class MyFeatureFlagContextProvider(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
    : PostHogFeatureFlagContextProvider
{
    protected override string? GetDistinctId()
        => httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User.Identity?.Name;
    
    protected override ValueTask<FeatureFlagOptions> GetFeatureFlagOptionsAsync()
    {
        // In a real app, you might get this information from a 
        // database or other source for the current user.
        return ValueTask.FromResult(
            new FeatureFlagOptions
            {
                PersonProperties = new Dictionary<string, object?>
                {
                    ["email"] = "some-test@example.com"
                },
                OnlyEvaluateLocally = true
            });
    }
}
```

Then, register your implementation in `Program.cs` (or `Startup.cs`):

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddPostHog(options => {
    options.UseFeatureManagement<MyFeatureFlagContextProvider>();
});
```

With this in place, you can now use `feature` tag helpers in your Razor views:

```html
<feature name="awesome-new-feature">
    <p>This is the new feature!</p>
</feature>
<feature name="awesome-new-feature" negate="true">
    <p>Sorry, no awesome new feature for you.</p>
</feature>
```

Multivariate feature flags are also supported:

```html
<feature name="awesome-new-feature" value="variant-a">
    <p>This is the new feature variant A!</p>
</feature>
<feature name="awesome-new-feature" value="variant-b">
    <p>This is the new feature variant B!</p>
</feature>
```

You can also use the `FeatureGateAttribute` to gate access to controllers or actions:

```csharp
[FeatureGate("awesome-new-feature")]
public class NewFeatureController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

## Experimental support for other platforms

The PostHog package is multi-targeted to support `net8.0` and `dotnetstandard2.1`. This means it can be used in a wider range of projects than just ASP.NET Core. However, this support is experimental and not officially supported.

If you are using a different platform, you can install the `PostHog` package instead of `PostHog.AspNetCore`. This package does not depend on ASP.NET Core and can be used in any .NET project.

```bash
dotnet add package PostHog
```

The `PostHogClient` class must be implemented as a singleton in your project. For `PostHog.AspNetCore`, this is handled by the `builder.AddPostHog();` method. For the `PostHog` package, you can do the following if you're using dependency injection:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddPostHog();
```

If you're not using a `builder` (such as in a console application), you can do the following:

```csharp
using PostHog;

var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddPostHog();
var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
var posthog = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IPostHogClient>();
```

The `AddPostHog` methods accept an optional `Action<PostHogOptions>` parameter that you can use to configure the client.

If you're not using dependency injection, you can create a static instance of the `PostHogClient` class and use that everywhere in your project:

```csharp
using PostHog;

public static readonly PostHogClient PostHog = new(new PostHogOptions {
    ProjectApiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>",
    HostUrl = new Uri("<ph_client_api_host>"),
    PersonalApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(
      "PostHog__PersonalApiKey")
});
```

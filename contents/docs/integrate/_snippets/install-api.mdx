#### How to authenticate using the personal API key

There are three options:

1. Use the `Authorization` header and `Bearer` authentication, like so:
    ```js
    const headers = {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}`
    }
    ```
2. Put the key in request body, like so:
    ```js
    const body = {
        personal_api_key: POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY
    }
    ```
3. Put the key in query string, like so:
    ```js
    const url = `https://app.posthog.com/api/event/?personal_api_key=${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}`
    ```

Any one of these methods works, but only the value encountered first (in the order above) will be used for authentication.

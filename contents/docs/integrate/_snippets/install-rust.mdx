Install the `posthog-rs` crate by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml file=Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
posthog-rs = "0.3.5"
```

Next, set up the client with your PostHog project key.

```rust
let client = posthog_rs::client(env!("<ph_project_api_key>"));
```

### Sync client

Our Rust SDK supports both synchronous and asynchronous clients. The asynchronous client is the default and is recommended for most use cases.

If you need to use a synchronous client instead - like we do in our [CLI](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/cli) -, you can opt into it by disabling the asynchronous feature on your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
posthog-rs = { version = "0.3.5", default-features = false }
```

You can continue to use the client as you would normally with the exception that the client will now be synchronous.

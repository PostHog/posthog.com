There are 2 steps to implement feature flags in Node:

### Step 1: Evaluate the feature flag value

#### Boolean feature flags

```node
const isFeatureFlagEnabled = await client.isFeatureEnabled('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')
if (isFeatureFlagEnabled) {
    // Your code if the flag is enabled

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    const matchedFlagPayload = await client.getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')
}
```

#### Multivariate feature flags

```node
const enabledVariant = await client.getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')

if (enabledVariant === 'variant-key') {  // replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    // Do something differently for this user

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    const matchedFlagPayload = await client.getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')
}
```

import IncludePropertyInEvents from "./include-feature-flag-property-in-backend-events.mdx" 

<IncludePropertyInEvents />

There are two methods you can use to include feature flag information in your events:

#### Method 1: Include the `$feature/feature_flag_name` property

 In the event properties, include `$feature/feature_flag_name: variant_key`:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        '$feature/feature-flag-key': 'variant-key' // replace feature-flag-key with your flag key. Replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    },
})
```

#### Method 2: Set `sendFeatureFlags` to `true`

import NodeSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue from "./feature-flags-code-node-set-send-feature-flags-to-true.mdx" 

<NodeSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue />

### Fetching all flags for a user

You can fetch all flag values for a single user by calling `getAllFlags()` or `getAllFlagsAndPayloads()`.

This is useful when you need to fetch multiple flag values and don't want to make multiple requests.

```node
await client.getAllFlags('distinct_id_of_your_user') 
await client.getAllFlagsAndPayloads('distinct_id_of_your_user')
```

### Sending `$feature_flag_called` events

Capturing `$feature_flag_called` events enable PostHog to know when a flag was accessed by a user and thus provide [analytics and insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) on the flag. By default, we send a these event when:

1. You call `posthog.getFeatureFlag()` or `posthog.isFeatureEnabled()`, AND 
2. It's a new user, or the value of the flag has changed. 

> *Note:* Tracking whether it's a new user or if a flag value has changed happens in a local cache. This means that if you reinitialize the PostHog client, the cache resets as well – causing `$feature_flag_called` events to be sent again when calling `getFeatureFlag` or `isFeatureEnabled`. PostHog is built to handle this, and so duplicate `$feature_flag_called` events won't affect your analytics.

You can disable automatically capturing `$feature_flag_called` events. For example, when you don't need the analytics, or it's being called at such a high volume that sending events slows things down.

To disable it, set the `sendFeatureFlagEvents` argument in your function call, like so:

```node
const isFeatureFlagEnabled = await client.isFeatureEnabled(
    'flag-key', 
    'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    {
        'sendFeatureFlagEvents': false
    })
```

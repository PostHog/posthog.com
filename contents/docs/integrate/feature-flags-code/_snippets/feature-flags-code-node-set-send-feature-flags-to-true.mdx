The `capture()` method has an optional argument `sendFeatureFlags`, which is set to `false` by default. This parameter controls whether feature flag information is sent with the event.

## Basic usage

Setting `sendFeatureFlags` to `true` will include feature flag information with the event:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    event: 'event_name',
    sendFeatureFlags: true,
})
```

#### Advanced usage (v5.5.0+)

As of version 5.5.0, `sendFeatureFlags` can also accept an options object for more granular control:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    event: 'event_name',
    sendFeatureFlags: {
        onlyEvaluateLocally: true,
        personProperties: { plan: 'premium' },
        groupProperties: { org: { tier: 'enterprise' } }
    }
})
```

#### Performance considerations

- **With local evaluation**: When [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) is configured, setting `sendFeatureFlags: true` will **not** make additional server requests. Instead, it uses the locally cached feature flags, and it provides an interface for including person and/or group properties needed to evaluate the flags in the context of the event, if required.

- **Without local evaluation**: PostHog will make an additional request to fetch feature flag information before capturing the event, which adds delay.

## Breaking change in v5.5.0

Prior to version 5.5.0, feature flags were automatically sent with events when using local evaluation, even when `sendFeatureFlags` was not explicitly set. This behavior has been **removed** in v5.5.0 to be more predictable and explicit.

If you were relying on this automatic behavior, you must now explicitly set `sendFeatureFlags: true` to continue sending feature flags with your events.

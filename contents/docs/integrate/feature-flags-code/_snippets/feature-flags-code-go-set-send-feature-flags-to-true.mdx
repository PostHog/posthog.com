The `Capture` struct has an optional field `SendFeatureFlags`, which is set to `false` by default. This parameter controls whether feature flag information is sent with the event.

#### Basic usage

Setting `SendFeatureFlags` to `true` will include feature flag information with the event:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "distinct_id_of_your_user",
  Event:      "event_name",
  SendFeatureFlags: true,
})
```

## Advanced usage (v1.6.1+)

As of version 1.6.1, `SendFeatureFlags` can also accept a `SendFeatureFlagsOptions` struct for more granular control:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "distinct_id_of_your_user",
  Event:      "event_name",
  SendFeatureFlags: posthog.SendFeatureFlagsOptions{
    OnlyEvaluateLocally: true,
    PersonProperties: map[string]interface{}{
      "plan": "premium",
    },
    GroupProperties: map[string]map[string]interface{}{
      "org": {
        "tier": "enterprise",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

#### Performance considerations

- **With local evaluation**: When [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) is configured, setting `SendFeatureFlags: true` will **not** make additional server requests. Instead, it uses the locally cached feature flags, and it provides an interface for including person and/or group properties needed to evaluate the flags in the context of the event, if required.

- **Without local evaluation**: PostHog will make an additional request to fetch feature flag information before capturing the event, which adds delay.

#### Breaking change in v1.6.1

Prior to version 1.6.1, feature flags were automatically sent with events when using local evaluation, even when `SendFeatureFlags` was not explicitly set. This behavior has been **removed** in v1.6.1 to be more predictable and explicit.

If you were relying on this automatic behavior, you must now explicitly set `SendFeatureFlags: true` to continue sending feature flags with your events.

There are two ways to implement feature flags in React Native:

1. Using hooks.
2. Loading the flag directly.

### Method 1: Using hooks

#### Example 1: Boolean feature flags
```react-native
import { useFeatureFlag } from 'posthog-react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const booleanFlag = useFeatureFlag('key-for-your-boolean-flag')

    if (showFlaggedFeature === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    }

    return showFlaggedFeature ? <Text>Testing feature ðŸ˜„</Text> : <Text>Not Testing feature ðŸ˜¢</Text>
}
```

#### Example 2: Multivariate feature flags

```react-native
import { useFeatureFlag } from 'posthog-react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const multiVariantFeature = useFeatureFlag('key-for-your-multivariate-flag')

    if (multiVariantFeature === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    } else if (multiVariantFeature === 'variant-name') { // replace 'variant-name' with the name of your variant
      // Do something
    }

    return <div/>
}
```

### Method 2: Loading the flag directly

```react-native
// Defaults to undefined if not loaded yet or if there was a problem loading
posthog.getFeatureFlag('key-for-your-boolean-flag')

// Multivariant feature flags are returned as a string
posthog.getFeatureFlag('key-for-your-multivariate-flag')
```

### Reloading flags

PostHog loads feature flags when instantiated and refreshes whenever methods are called that affect the flag. 

If you have the need to forcefully trigger the refresh however you can use `reloadFeatureFlagsAsync()`:

```react-native
posthog.reloadFeatureFlagsAsync().then((refreshedFlags) => console.log(refreshedFlags))
```

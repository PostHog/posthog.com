There are 2 steps to implement feature flags in Go:

### Step 1: Evaluate the feature flag value

#### Boolean feature flags

```go
isMyFlagEnabled, err := client.IsFeatureEnabled(
            FeatureFlagPayload{
                Key:        "flag-key",
                DistinctId: "distinct_id_of_your_user",
            })

if isMyFlagEnabled == true {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

#### Multivariate feature flags

```go
enabledVariant, err := client.GetFeatureFlag(
            FeatureFlagPayload{
                Key:        "flag-key",
                DistinctId: "distinct_id_of_your_user",
            })

if enabledVariant == "variant-key" { // replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

import IncludePropertyInEvents from "./include-feature-flag-property-in-backend-events.mdx" 

<IncludePropertyInEvents />

There are two methods you can use to include feature flag information in your events:

#### Method 1: Include the `$feature/feature_flag_name` property

 In the event properties, include `$feature/feature_flag_name: variant_key`:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "distinct_id_of_your_user",
  Event:      "event_name",
  Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
    Set("$feature/feature-flag-key", "variant-key"), // replace feature-flag-key with your flag key. Replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
})
```

#### Method 2: Set `SendFeatureFlags` to `true`

import GoSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue from "./feature-flags-code-go-set-send-feature-flags-to-true.mdx" 

<GoSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue />

### Fetching all flags for a user

You can fetch all flag values for a single user by calling `GetAllFlags()`.

This is useful when you need to fetch multiple flag values and don't want to make multiple requests.

```go  
featureVariants, _ := client.GetAllFlags(FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey{
        DistinctId: "distinct_id_of_your_user",
})
```

### Sending `$feature_flag_called` events

Capturing `$feature_flag_called` events enable PostHog to know when a flag was accessed by a user and thus provide [analytics and insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) on the flag. By default, we send a these event when:

1. You call `GetFeatureFlag()` or `IsFeatureEnabled()`, AND 
2. It's a new user, or the value of the flag has changed. 

> *Note:* Tracking whether it's a new user or if a flag value has changed happens in a local cache. This means that if you reinitialize the PostHog client, the cache resets as well – causing `$feature_flag_called` events to be sent again when calling `GetFeatureFlag` or `IsFeatureEnabled`. PostHog is built to handle this, and so duplicate `$feature_flag_called` events won't affect your analytics.

You can disable automatically capturing `$feature_flag_called` events. For example, when you don't need the analytics, or it's being called at such a high volume that sending events slows things down.

To disable it, set the `SendFeatureFlagEvents` argument in your function call, like so:

```go
isMyFlagEnabled, err := client.IsFeatureEnabled(
            FeatureFlagPayload{
                Key:                    "flag-key",
                DistinctId:             "distinct_id_of_your_user",
                SendFeatureFlagEvents:  true
            })
```

import GoOverrideServerProperties from './override-server-properties/go.mdx'

<GoOverrideServerProperties />

### Request timeout

You can configure the `FeatureFlagRequestTimeout` parameter when initializing your PostHog client to set a flag request timeout. This helps prevent your code from being blocked in the case when PostHog's servers are too slow to respond. By default, this is set at 3 seconds.

```go
 client, _ := posthog.NewWithConfig(
   os.Getenv("<ph_project_api_key>"),
   posthog.Config{
      PersonalApiKey:            "your personal API key", // Required for feature flags
      Endpoint:                  "<ph_instance_address>",
      FeatureFlagRequestTimeout: 3 // Time in seconds. Default is 3.
   },
)
```

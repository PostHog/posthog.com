### Boolean feature flags

```dart
if (await Posthog().isFeatureEnabled('flag-key')) {
    // Do something differently for this user

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    final matchedFlagPayload = await Posthog().getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key');
}
```

### Multivariate feature flags

```dart
if (await Posthog().getFeatureFlag('flag-key') == 'variant-key') {// replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    // Do something differently for this user

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    final matchedFlagPayload = await Posthog().getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key');
}
```

### Ensuring flags are loaded before usage

Every time a user loads a screen, we send a request in the background to fetch the feature flags that apply to that user. We store those flags in the storage.

This means that for most screens, the feature flags are available immediately – **except for the first time a user visits**.

### Reloading feature flags

Feature flag values are cached. If something has changed with your user and you'd like to refetch their flag values, call:

```dart
await Posthog().reloadFeatureFlags();
```

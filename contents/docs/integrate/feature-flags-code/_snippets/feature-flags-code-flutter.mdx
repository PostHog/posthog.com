### Boolean feature flags

```dart
Posthog.isFeatureEnabled(
  key: 'flag-key',
);
```

### Multivariate feature flags

Multivariate feature flags are not yet available in our Flutter SDK.

### Reloading feature flags

Feature flag values are cached. If something has changed with your user and you'd like to refetch their flag values, call `PostHog.reloadFeatureFlags()`.

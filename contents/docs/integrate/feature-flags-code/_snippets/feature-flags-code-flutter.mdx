### Boolean feature flags

```dart
Posthog().isFeatureEnabled('flag-key');
```

### Multivariate feature flags

Available from version [4.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-flutter/releases/tag/4.0.0-alpha.1) and above.

```dart
if (await Posthog().getFeatureFlag('flag-key') == 'variant-key') { // replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    // do something
}
```

### Reloading feature flags

Feature flag values are cached. If something has changed with your user and you'd like to refetch their flag values, call `Posthog().reloadFeatureFlags()`.

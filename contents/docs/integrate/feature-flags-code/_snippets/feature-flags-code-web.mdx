### Boolean feature flags

```js-web
if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('flag-key') ) {
    // Do something differently for this user

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    const matchedFlagPayload = posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key')
}
```

### Multivariate feature flags

```js-web
if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('flag-key')  == 'variant-key') { // replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    // Do something differently for this user
    
    // Optional: fetch the payload
    const matchedFlagPayload = posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key')
}
```

### Ensuring flags are loaded before usage

Every time a user loads a page, we send a request in the background to fetch the feature flags that apply to that user. We store those flags in a cookie.

This means that for most pages, the feature flags are available immediately â€“ **except for the first time a user visits**.

To handle this, you can use the `onFeatureFlags` callback to wait for the feature flag request to finish:

```js-web
posthog.onFeatureFlags(function () {
    // feature flags are guaranteed to be available at this point
    if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('flag-key')) {
        // do something
    }
})
```

### Reloading feature flags

Feature flag values are cached. If something changed with your user and you want to refetch their flag values, call `posthog.reloadFeatureFlags()`.

The `capture()` method has an optional argument `send_feature_flags`, which is set to `false` by default. This parameter controls whether feature flag information is sent with the event.

## Basic usage

Setting `send_feature_flags` to `True` will include feature flag information with the event:

```python
posthog.capture(
    distinct_id="distinct_id_of_the_user",
    event='event_name',
    send_feature_flags=True
)
```

## Advanced usage (v6.2.0+)

As of version 6.2.0, `send_feature_flags` can also accept a dictionary for more granular control:

```python
posthog.capture(
    distinct_id="distinct_id_of_the_user",
    event='event_name',
    send_feature_flags={
        'only_evaluate_locally': True,
        'person_properties': {'plan': 'premium'},
        'group_properties': {'org': {'tier': 'enterprise'}}
    }
)
```

#### Performance considerations

- **With local evaluation**: When [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) is configured, setting `send_feature_flags: True` will **not** make additional server requests. Instead, it uses the locally cached feature flags, and it provides an interface for including person and/or group properties needed to evaluate the flags in the context of the event, if required.

- **Without local evaluation**: PostHog will make an additional request to fetch feature flag information before capturing the event, which adds delay.

## Breaking change in v6.2.0

**Important**: Prior to version 6.2.0, feature flags were automatically sent with events when using local evaluation, even when `send_feature_flags` was not explicitly set. This behavior has been **removed** in v5.5.0 to be more predictable and explicit.

If you were relying on this automatic behavior, you must now explicitly set `send_feature_flags=True` to continue sending feature flags with your events.

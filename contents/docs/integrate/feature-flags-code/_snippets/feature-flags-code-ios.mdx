### Boolean feature flags

```swift
if (PostHogSDK.shared.isFeatureEnabled("flag-key")) {
    // Do something differently for this user

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    let matchedFlagPayload = PostHogSDK.shared.getFeatureFlagPayload("flag-key")
}
```

### Multivariate feature flags

```swift
if (PostHogSDK.shared.getFeatureFlag("flag-key") as? String == "variant-key") { // replace "variant-key" with the key of your variant
    // Do something differently for this user

    // Optional: fetch the payload
    let matchedFlagPayload = PostHogSDK.shared.getFeatureFlagPayload("flag-key")
}
```

### Reloading feature flags

Feature flag values are cached. If something has changed with your user and you'd like to refetch their flag values, call:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.reloadFeatureFlags()
```

### Ensuring flags are loaded before usage

Every time a user opens the app, we send a request in the background to fetch the feature flags that apply to that user. We store those flags in the storage.

This means that for most screens, the feature flags are available immediately â€“ **except for the first time a user visits**.

To handle this, you can use the `didReceiveFeatureFlags` notification to wait for the feature flag request to finish:

```swift
class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        // register for `didReceiveFeatureFlags` notification before SDK initialization
        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
            self,
            selector: #selector(receiveFeatureFlags),
            name: PostHogSDK.didReceiveFeatureFlags,
            object: nil
        )

        let POSTHOG_API_KEY = "<ph_project_api_key>"
        // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
        let POSTHOG_HOST = "https://us.i.posthog.com"

        let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: POSTHOG_API_KEY, host: POSTHOG_HOST)

        PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)

        return true
    }

    // The "receiveFeatureFlags" method will be called when the SDK receives the feature flags from the server.
    @objc func receiveFeatureFlags() {
        print("receiveFeatureFlags called")
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the completion block of the `reloadFeatureFlags(_:)` method. This allows you to execute logic immediately after the flags are reloaded:


``` swift
// Reload feature flags and check if a specific feature is enabled
PostHogSDK.shared.reloadFeatureFlags {
    if PostHogSDK.shared.isFeatureEnabled("flag-key") {
        // do something
    }
}
```

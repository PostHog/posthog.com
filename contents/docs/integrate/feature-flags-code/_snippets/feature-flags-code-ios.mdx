### Boolean feature flags

```swift
if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('flag-key')) {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

### Multivariate feature flags

```swift
if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('my-flag') == "variant-key") { // replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    // do something
}
```

### Reloading feature flags

Feature flag values are cached. If something has change with your user and you'd like to refetch their flag values, call `posthog.reloadFeatureFlags()`.

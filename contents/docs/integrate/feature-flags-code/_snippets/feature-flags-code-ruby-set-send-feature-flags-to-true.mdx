The `capture()` method has an optional argument `send_feature_flags`, which is set to `false` by default. This parameter controls whether feature flag information is sent with the event.

#### Basic usage

Setting `send_feature_flags` to `true` will include feature flag information with the event:

```ruby
posthog.capture({
    distinct_id: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    event: 'event_name',
    send_feature_flags: true,
})
```

## Advanced usage (v3.1.0+)

As of version 3.1.0, `send_feature_flags` can also accept a hash for more granular control:

```ruby
posthog.capture({
    distinct_id: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    event: 'event_name',
    send_feature_flags: {
        only_evaluate_locally: true,
        person_properties: { plan: 'premium' },
        group_properties: { org: { tier: 'enterprise' } }
    }
})
```

#### Performance considerations

- **With local evaluation**: When [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) is configured, setting `send_feature_flags: true` will **not** make additional server requests. Instead, it uses the locally cached feature flags, and it provides an interface for including person and/or group properties needed to evaluate the flags in the context of the event, if required.

- **Without local evaluation**: PostHog will make an additional request to fetch feature flag information before capturing the event, which adds delay.

#### Breaking change in v3.1.0

Prior to version 3.1.0, feature flags were automatically sent with events when using local evaluation, even when `send_feature_flags` was not explicitly set. This behavior has been **removed** in v3.1.0 to be more predictable and explicit.

If you were relying on this automatic behavior, you must now explicitly set `send_feature_flags: true` to continue sending feature flags with your events.

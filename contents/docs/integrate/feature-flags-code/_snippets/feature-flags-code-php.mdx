There are 2 steps to implement feature flags in PHP:

### Step 1: Evaluate the feature flag value

#### Boolean feature flags

```php
$isMyFlagEnabledForUser = PostHog::isFeatureEnabled('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')

if ($isMyFlagEnabledForUser) {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

#### Multivariate feature flags

```php
$enabledVariant = PostHog::getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')

if ($enabledVariant === 'variant-key') { # replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    # Do something differently for this user
}
```

import IncludePropertyInEvents from "./include-feature-flag-property-in-backend-events.mdx" 

<IncludePropertyInEvents />

There are two methods you can use to include feature flag information in your events:

#### Method 1: Include the `$feature/feature_flag_name` property

 In the event properties, include `$feature/feature_flag_name: variant_key`:

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
  'distinctId' => 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
  'event' => 'event_name',
  'properties' => array(
    '$feature/feature-flag-key'  = 'variant-key' # replace feature-flag-key with your flag key. Replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
  )
));
```

#### Method 2: Set `send_feature_flags` to `true`

import PHPSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue from "./feature-flags-code-php-set-send-feature-flags-to-true.mdx" 

<PHPSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue />

### Fetching all flags for a user

You can fetch all flag values for a single user by calling `getAllFlags()`.

This is useful when you need to fetch multiple flag values and don't want to make multiple requests.

```php  
PostHog::getAllFlags('distinct_id_of_your_user')
```

### Sending `$feature_flag_called` events

Capturing `$feature_flag_called` events enable PostHog to know when a flag was accessed by a user and thus provide [analytics and insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) on the flag. By default, we send a these event when:

1. You call `getFeatureFlag()` or `isFeatureEnabled()`, AND 
2. It's a new user, or the value of the flag has changed. 

> *Note:* Tracking whether it's a new user or if a flag value has changed happens in a local cache. This means that if you reinitialize the PostHog client, the cache resets as well – causing `$feature_flag_called` events to be sent again when calling `getFeatureFlag` or `isFeatureEnabled`. PostHog is built to handle this, and so duplicate `$feature_flag_called` events won't affect your analytics.

You can disable automatically capturing `$feature_flag_called` events. For example, when you don't need the analytics, or it's being called at such a high volume that sending events slows things down.

To disable it, set the `sendFeatureFlagEvents` argument in your function call, like so:

```php
$isMyFlagEnabledForUser = PostHog::isFeatureEnabled(
    key: 'flag-key',
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    sendFeatureFlagEvents: true
)
```

import PHPOverrideServerProperties from './override-server-properties/php.mdx'

<PHPOverrideServerProperties />

### Request timeout

You can configure the `feature_flag_request_timeout_ms` parameter when initializing your PostHog client to set a flag request timeout. This helps prevent your code from being blocked in the case when PostHog's servers are too slow to respond. By default, this is set at 3 seconds.

```php
PostHog::init("<ph_project_api_key>",
  array(
    'host' => '<ph_instance_address>',
    'feature_flag_request_timeout_ms' => 3000 // Time in milliseconds. Default is 3000 (3 seconds).
  ) 
);
```

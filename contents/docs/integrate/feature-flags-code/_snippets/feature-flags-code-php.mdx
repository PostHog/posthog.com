There are 2 steps to implement feature flags in PHP:

### Step 1: Evaluate the feature flag value

#### Boolean feature flags

```php
$isMyFlagEnabledForUser = PostHog::isFeatureEnabled('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')

if ($isMyFlagEnabledForUser) {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

#### Multivariate feature flags

```php
$enabledVariant = PostHog::getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'distinct_id_of_your_user')

if ($enabledVariant === 'variant-key') { # replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
    # Do something differently for this user
}
```

import IncludePropertyInEvents from "./include-feature-flag-property-in-backend-events.mdx" 

<IncludePropertyInEvents />

There are two methods you can use to include feature flag information in your events:

#### Method 1: Include the `$feature/feature_flag_name` property

 In the event properties, include `$feature/feature_flag_name: variant_key`:

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
  'distinctId' => 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
  'event' => 'event_name',
  'properties' => array(
    '$feature/feature-flag-key'  = 'variant-key' # replace feature-flag-key with your flag key. Replace 'variant-key' with the key of your variant
  )
));
```

#### Method 2: Set `send_feature_flags` to `true`

import PHPSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue from "./feature-flags-code-php-set-send-feature-flags-to-true.mdx" 

<PHPSetSendFeatureFlagsTrue />

### Fetching all flags for a user

You can fetch all flag values for a single user by calling `getAllFlags()`.

This is useful when you need to fetch multiple flag values and don't want to make multiple requests.

```php  
PostHog::getAllFlags('distinct_id_of_your_user')
```

### Sending `$feature_flag_called` events

Capturing `$feature_flag_called` events enable PostHog to know when a flag was accessed by a user and thus provide [analytics and insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) on the flag. By default, we send a these event when:

1. You call `getFeatureFlag()` or `isFeatureEnabled()`, AND 
2. It's a new user, or the value of the flag has changed. 

> *Note:* Tracking whether it's a new user or if a flag value has changed happens in a local cache. This means that if you reinitialize the PostHog client, the cache resets as well â€“ causing `$feature_flag_called` events to be sent again when calling `getFeatureFlag` or `isFeatureEnabled`. PostHog is built to handle this, and so duplicate `$feature_flag_called` events won't affect your analytics.

You can disable automatically capturing `$feature_flag_called` events. For example, when you don't need the analytics, or it's being called at such a high volume that sending events slows things down.

To disable it, set the `sendFeatureFlagEvents` argument in your function call, like so:

```php
$isMyFlagEnabledForUser = PostHog::isFeatureEnabled(
    key: 'flag-key',
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_your_user',
    sendFeatureFlagEvents: false
)
```

import PHPOverrideServerProperties from './override-server-properties/php.mdx'

<PHPOverrideServerProperties />

### Request timeout

You can configure the `feature_flag_request_timeout_ms` parameter when initializing your PostHog client to set a flag request timeout. This helps prevent your code from being blocked in the case when PostHog's servers are too slow to respond. By default, this is set at 3 seconds.

```php
PostHog::init("<ph_project_api_key>",
  array(
    'host' => '<ph_client_api_host>',
    'feature_flag_request_timeout_ms' => 3000 // Time in milliseconds. Default is 3000 (3 seconds).
  ) 
);
```

### Error handling

When using the PostHog SDK, it's important to handle potential errors that may occur during feature flag operations. Here's an example of how to wrap PostHog SDK methods in an error handler:

```php
function handleFeatureFlag($client, $flagKey, $distinctId) {
    try {
        $isEnabled = $client->isFeatureEnabled($flagKey, $distinctId);
        echo "Feature flag '$flagKey' for user '$distinctId' is " . ($isEnabled ? 'enabled' : 'disabled') . "\n";
        return $isEnabled;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo "Error fetching feature flag '$flagKey': " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
        // Optionally, you can return a default value or throw the error
        // return false; // Default to disabled
        throw $e;
    }
}

// Usage example
try {
    $flagEnabled = handleFeatureFlag($client, 'new-feature', 'user-123');
    if ($flagEnabled) {
        // Implement new feature logic
    } else {
        // Implement old feature logic
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle the error at a higher level
    echo 'Feature flag check failed, using default behavior';
    // Implement fallback logic
}
```

PostHog provides multiple integrations to send events from your apps and use the API of your PostHog instance.

We have put a significant effort into providing as many of these integrations as possible, in order to make your experience better.

Our goal is for users to be able to integrate PostHog with their language, framework or platform of choosing, without having to adapt their stack.

## Libraries

Refer to the table below for an overview of the functionality in each of our libraries.

### Client Libraries

Some features such as session recording are only available with our JavaScript library.

> We're working to add support for feature flags and autocapture to as many libraries as possible. Please check out the individual library repositories for status on this and let us know if you think we should prioritize support for any specific library.

After you have your PostHog deployment up and running, the next step is to start sending events.
This guide gives a general overview of all the ways to bring data into PostHog, with links to guides that provide step-by-step information for setting up each method.

This guide covers the following:

-   [JS Snippet](#snippet): A small piece of JavaScript code you can include in your website to get tracking set up quick
-   [Client libraries](#client-libraries): Language and framework specific SDKs for more in-depth event tracking on the frontend
-   [Server libraries](#server-libraries): Packages for sending events to PostHog directly from your backend server
-   [Apps](#apps): Integrate with 3rd party services to import data or transform your events
-   [API](#api): Send events directly to PostHog using our API

> **Note: ** The following information only covers how to bring in _new_ events. If you have a data warehouse or database with _past_ events, see [this guide](/docs/integrate/ingest-historical-data) on importing historical data.

## Snippet

This is the simplest way to get PostHog up and running on your website, and only takes a few minutes to set-up.
This method generally works best for non-technical users or for very simple websites which don't need full tracking.
If you do need to set up more detailed tracking, take a look at our [client libraries](#client-libraries).

After including the snippet on your website, it will automatically start to:

-   Capture `$pageview` events when a user visits a page
-   Track when users [click on links or buttons](/docs/user-guides/events#autocapture-event-tracking)
-   Record videos of [user sessions](/docs/user-guides/recordings) that you can play back

### Installation

For a detailed guide on how to install the snippet, read our [installation guide](/docs/integrate/client/snippet-installation).

## Libraries

This is the most flexible way of integrating with PostHog, and generally the one we recommend if there's a package for the language or framework you're using.

These libraries allow you to:

-   Track events that aren't automatically captured
-   Add extra information to events
-   Identify logged-in users and attribute events to them
-   Use advanced functionality such as feature flags <span class="text-black/40">_(If supported by your chosen library)_</span>

For more information, read the [live data ingestion guide](/docs/integrate/ingest-live-data).

### Client libraries

Client libraries let you send events to PostHog from your frontend website or app. This is generally the best option for tracking UI related events as well as events from anonymous users.

**Official libraries**

-   [JavaScript](/docs/integrate/client/js)
-   [Android](/docs/integrate/client/android)
-   [iOS](/docs/integrate/client/ios)
-   [Flutter](/docs/integrate/client/flutter)
-   [React Native](/docs/integrate/client/react-native)

Check out the pages above for information on how to set-up each library, as well as which features each library supports.

### Server libraries

Server libraries let you send events to PostHog directly from your backend server. In most cases, sending events from the server-side is the best and most reliable option, however this generally only works well for users who are signed in.

**Official libraries**

-   [NodeJS](/docs/integrate/server/node)
-   [Python](/docs/integrate/server/python)
-   [PHP](/docs/integrate/server/php)
-   [Ruby](/docs/integrate/server/ruby)
-   [Golang](/docs/integrate/server/go)
-   [Java](/docs/integrate/server/java)

**Community libraries**

-   [Elixir](/docs/integrate/server/elixir)
-   [Nim](https://github.com/Yardanico/posthog-nim)

Check out the pages above for information on how to set-up each library, as well as which features each library supports. _As a note, session recording is only supported in client-side libraries._

## Apps

Apps extend PostHog's functionality and are an incredibly powerful part of the PostHog ecosystem. If you need to bring in data from a 3rd party service or perform some operation on _all_ events coming into PostHog, apps are generally the best and most reliable option.

Apps can help you:

-   Import data from 3rd party services
-   Enrich events in your pipeline by adding extra data
-   Filter events to keep your data clean

### Installation

Below is a list of all our apps for bringing data and events into PostHog. Apps can be installed from the app section in the [dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/project/apps).
For information on how to set up each app, the list below contains links to each app's documentation page.

### Ingestion apps (25)

For a list of all our apps, see [here](/apps)

<IngestionAppsList />

> For more detail on how apps work and tutorials on how to build your own, see our [apps docs](/docs/apps).

## API

Events can also be ingested directly using our API and the [`/capture`](/docs/api/post-only-endpoints#capture) endpoint, which is the same endpoint that all of our libraries use behind the scenes.

Generally, this isn't something you'll need to use when integrating PostHog, but if you're working with a language or framework that PostHog doesn't support yet, this will allow you to still send events.

For more information, read our [API docs](/docs/api/post-only-endpoints).

[Click here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-react-native) for the PostHog React Native library. This is an optional library you can install if you're working with React Native. 

This page of the Docs refers specifically to the Official PostHog React Native Library to capture and send events to any PostHog instance (including posthog.com).

This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, 
making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

## Installation

import ReactNativeInstall from './react-native/snippets/install.mdx'

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Configuration

import ReactNativeConfigure from './react-native/snippets/configure.mdx'

<ReactNativeConfigure />

## Making calls

### Identify

import ReactNativeIdentify from './react-native/snippets/identify.mdx'

<ReactNativeIdentify />

### Capture

import ReactNativeCapture from './react-native/snippets/capture.mdx'

### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing. 
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have gathered.

You can also manually flush the queue, like so:

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.flush()
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.reset()
```

### Opt In/Out

To Opt In/Out of tracking, use the following calls:

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.enable() // opt in
PostHog.disable() // opt out
```

This is the suggested way to prevent capturing data from the admin on the page, as well as from team members of your organization. A simple way to do this is to access the page as the admin (or any other user on your team you wish to stop capturing data on), and call `posthog.opt_out_capturing();` on the developer console. You can also add this logic in you app and call it directly after an admin/team member logs in. 

If you still wish to capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

### Sending screen views

With `recordScreenViews`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

This function requires a `name`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.screen("Dashboard", {
    background: 'blue',
    hero: 'superhog'
})
```

## Thank You

This library is largely based on the `analytics-react-native` package.

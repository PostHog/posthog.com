Capture allows you to send events related to anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find 
patterns in usage, work out which features to improve, or find out where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

* `event name` to specify the event
  * We recommend using [noun] [verb], like `movie played` or `movie updated` to easily identify what your events mean later on.

Optionally you can submit:

* `properties`, which can be an array with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```objectivec
// in objective-c
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++" }];
```

```js
// in swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"])
```

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

**Example**

```c
// in objective-c
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++", @"$set":@{ @"userProp": "value1" } }];
```

```c
// in swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++", "$set": ["userProp": "value1"] ])
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```c
// in objective-c
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++", @"$set_once":@{ @"userProp": "value1" } }];
```

```c
// in swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++", "$set_once": ["userProp": "value1"] ])
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

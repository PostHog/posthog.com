This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

## Installation

import IOSInstall from './snippets/install.mdx'
import IOSConfigure from './snippets/configure.mdx'
import IOSIdentify from './snippets/identify.mdx'
import IOSCapture from './snippets/capture.mdx'

<IOSInstall />

## Configuration

<IOSConfigure />

## Making calls

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

### Capture

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

**Example**

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++", @"$set":@{ @"userProp": "value1" } }];
```

```swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++", "$set": ["userProp": "value1"] ])
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Signed Up" properties:@{ @"plan": @"Pro++", @"$set_once":@{ @"userProp": "value1" } }];
```

```swift
posthog.capture("Signed Up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++", "$set_once": ["userProp": "value1"] ])
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

```objectivec
configuration.flushAt = 1;
```

You can also manually flush the queue:

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"Logged Out"];
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] flush]
```

```swift
posthog.capture('Logged Out')
posthog.flush()
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] reset]
```

```swift
posthog.reset()
```

### Sending screen views

With `configuration.recordScreenViews` set as `YES`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] screen:@"Dashboard" properties:@{ @"fromIcon": @"bottom" }];
```

```swift
posthog.screen("Dashboard", properties: ["fromIcon": "bottom"])
```

## A note about IDFA (identifier for advertisers) collection in iOS 14

Starting with iOS 14, Apple will further restrict apps that track users. Any references to Apple's AdSupport framework, even in strings, [will trip](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/issues/6) the App Store's static analysis.

Hence **starting with posthog-ios version 1.2.0** we have removed all references to Apple's AdSupport framework.

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] group:@"organization" groupKey:@"42dlsfj23f"];
```

```swift
posthog.group( "some-type", groupKey: "42dlsfj23f")
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] group:@"organization" groupKey:@"42dlsfj23f" properties:@{ @"name": @"Awesome Inc." }];
```

```swift
posthog.group( "organization", groupKey: "42dlsfj23f", properties: [
    "name": "ACME Corp"
])
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

### Feature Flags

[Feature Flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features.

> **Note:** This requires minimum library version 2.0.0


Here's how you can use them:

-   Check if a feature is enabled:

```objectivec
[[PHGPosthog sharedPostHog] isFeatureEnabled:@"keyword"];
```

```swift
posthog.isFeatureEnabled('keyword')
```

-   Trigger a reload of the feature flags:

```objectivec
[[PHGPosthog sharedPostHog] reloadFeatureFlags];
```

```swift
posthog.reloadFeatureFlags()
```

-   By default, this function will send a `$feature_flag_called` event to your instance every time it's called so you're able to do analytics.

**Get a flag value**

If you're using multivariate feature flags, you can also get the value of the flag, as well as whether or not it is enabled.

```objectivec
[[PHGPosthog sharedPostHog] getFeatureFlag:@"some-flag"];
```

```swift
posthog.getFeatureFlag("some-flag")
```

## All configuration options

The `configuration` element contains several other settings you can toggle:

```objectivec
/**
 * Whether the posthog client should use location services.
 * If `YES` and the host app hasn't asked for permission to use location services then the user will be
 * presented with an alert view asking to do so. `NO` by default. If `YES`, please make sure to add a
 * description for `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` explaining why your app is
 * accessing Location APIs.
 */
configuration.shouldUseLocationServices = NO;

/**
 * The number of queued events that the posthog client should flush at. Setting this to `1` will not queue
 * any events and will use more battery. `20` by default.
 */
configuration.flushAt = 20;

/**
 * The amount of time to wait before each tick of the flush timer.
 * Smaller values will make events delivered in a more real-time manner and also use more battery.
 * A value smaller than 10 seconds will seriously degrade overall performance.
 * 30 seconds by default.
 */
configuration.flushInterval = 30;

/**
 * The maximum number of items to queue before starting to drop old ones. This should be a value greater
 * than zero, the behaviour is undefined otherwise. `1000` by default.
 */
configuration.maxQueueSize = 1000;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically make a capture call for application lifecycle events,
 * such as "Application Installed", "Application Updated" and "Application Opened".
 */
configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = NO;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should record bluetooth information. If `YES`, please make sure to add a
 * description for `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist` explaining explaining why
 * your app is accessing Bluetooth APIs. `NO` by default.
 */
configuration.shouldUseBluetooth = NO;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically make a screen call when a view controller is added to
 * a view hierarchy. Because the underlying implementation uses method swizzling, we recommend initializing
 * the posthog client as early as possible (before any screens are displayed), ideally during the
 * Application delegate's applicationDidFinishLaunching method.
 */
configuration.recordScreenViews = NO;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically capture in-app purchases from the App Store.
 */
configuration.captureInAppPurchases = NO;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically capture push notifications.
 */
configuration.capturePushNotifications = NO;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically capture deep links. You'll still need to call the
 * continueUserActivity and openURL methods on the posthog client.
 */
configuration.captureDeepLinks = NO;

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should include the `$device_id` property when sending events.
 * When enabled, `UIDevice`'s `identifierForVendor` property is used. Changing the value of
 * of this property after initializing the client will have no effect.
 * The default value is `YES`.
 */
configuration.shouldSendDeviceID = YES;
```

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-ios` package.

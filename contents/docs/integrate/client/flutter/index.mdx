[Click here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-flutter) for the `posthog-flutter` library. This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Flutter. 

This page of the Docs refers specifically to the Official PostHog Flutter Library to capture and send events to any PostHog instance (including posthog.com).

This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously,
making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

## Package

import FlutterPackage from './snippets/package.mdx'

<FlutterPackage />

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `posthog_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

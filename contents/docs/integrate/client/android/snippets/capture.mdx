Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find 
patterns in usage, work out which features to improve, or find out where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

* `event` to specify the event name
  * We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

* `properties`, which can be an array with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```js
PostHog.with(this)
       .capture("Button B Clicked", new Properties()
                                        .putValue("color", "blue")
                                        .putValue("icon", "new2-final"));
```

It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

**Example**

```java
// import java.util.HashMap;
HashMap<String, Object> userProps = new HashMap<String, Object>();
userProps.put("string", "value1");
userProps.put("integer", 2);

PostHog.with(this)
       .capture("Button B Clicked", new Properties()
                                        .putValue("color", "blue")
                                        .putValue("$set", userProps));
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```java
// import java.util.HashMap;
HashMap<String, Object> userProps = new HashMap<String, Object>();
userProps.put("string", "value1");
userProps.put("integer", 2);

PostHog.with(this)
       .capture("Button B Clicked", new Properties()
                                        .putValue("color", "blue")
                                        .putValue("$set_once", userProps));
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. The default value for this is `20`.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have been gathered.

```java
PostHog posthog = new PostHog.Builder(this, POSTHOG_API_KEY, POSTHOG_HOST)
  .flushQueueSize(20)
  .flushInterval(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
  .build();

```

You can also manually flush the queue:

```java
PostHog.with(this)
       .flush();
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```java
PostHog.with(this)
       .reset();
```

### Sending screen views

With `recordScreenViews()`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

This function requires a `name`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```java
PostHog.with(this)
       .screen("Dashboard", new Properties()
                                  .putValue("background", "blue")
                                  .putValue("hero", "superhog"));
```

### Feature Flags

PostHog v1.10.0 introduced [Feature Flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags), which allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features. This feature requires posthog-android version of `2.0.0` or above.

Here's how you can use them:

-   Check if a feature is enabled:

```java
PostHog.with(this).isFeatureEnabled("enabled-flag")
```

-   Trigger a reload of the feature flags:

```java
PostHog.with(this).reloadFeatureFlags()
```

**Get a flag value**

If you're using multivariate feature flags, you can also get the value of the flag, as well as whether or not it is enabled.

```java
PostHog.with(this).getFeatureFlag("enabled-flag")
```

-   By default, this function will send a `$feature_flag_called` event to your instance every time it's called so you're able to do analytics.

### Groups

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```java
PostHog.with(this).group("organization", "42dlsfj23f") // organization is the group type, 42dlsfj23f is the group ID
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```java
PostHog.with(this).group("organization", "42dlsfj23f", new Properties().putValue("name", "Awesome Inc."));
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## All configuration options

When creating the PostHog client, there are many options you can set:

```java
PostHog posthog = new PostHog.Builder(this, POSTHOG_API_KEY, POSTHOG_HOST)
    // Record certain application events automatically! (off/false by default)
    .captureApplicationLifecycleEvents()

     // Record screen views automatically! (off/false by default)
    .recordScreenViews()

    // Capture deep links as part of the screen call. (off by default)
    .captureDeepLinks()

     // Maximum number of events to keep in queue before flushing (20)
    .flushQueueSize(int flushQueueSize)

    // Max delay before flushing the queue (30 seconds)
    .flushInterval(long flushInterval, TimeUnit timeUnit)

    // Enable or disable collection of ANDROID_ID (true)
    .collectDeviceId(boolean collect)

    .build();
```

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-android` package.

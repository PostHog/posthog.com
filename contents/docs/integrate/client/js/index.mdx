> **Note:** You can just use our [snippet](/docs/integrate) to start capturing events with our JS.

This page of the Docs refers to our [posthog-js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js) library.

## Why does this exist?

The reason this exists is that whilst the default snippet captures every click on certain elements (like `a`, `button`, `input` etc.) and page views, it's often worth sending more context whenever a user does something. This might also be useful if you have a one page app.

## Installation

import JSInstall from './snippets/install.mdx'

<JSInstall />

## Usage

### Autocapture

import JSAutoCapture from './snippets/autocapture.mdx'
import JSCaptureIgnoreElements from './snippets/capture-ignore-elements.mdx'

<JSAutoCapture />

#### Tuning autocapture

You can configure autocapture using allowlists. If an array is passed for an allowlist, autocapture events will only be sent for elements matching at least one of the items in the array.

For example, to only capture clicks on buttons on the docs section of the website that contain the data attribute `ph-autocapture` you can do:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        autocapture: {
                event_allowlist: ['click'], // DOM events from this list ['click', 'change', 'submit']
                url_allowlist: ['posthog.com\.\/docs\/.*'], // strings or RegExps
                element_allowlist: ['button'], // DOM elements from this list ['a', 'button', 'form', 'input', 'select', 'textarea', 'label']
                css_selector_allowlist: ['[ph-autocapture]'] // List of CSS selectors
            }
    }
)
```

The allowlists only filter autocapture events, they won't affect the data collected by session recordings.

<JSCaptureIgnoreElements />

Alternatively you can disable autocapture completely by setting `autocapture: false` in the config.

Disabling autocapture **will not disable session recording**. You can disable session recording using `disable_session_recording` or by turning it off in your project's settings.

#### Autocapture on input elements

For security reasons, PostHog is very conservative regarding `input` tags to prevent passwords or other sensitive data from being collected.

Specifically, PostHog autocapture will grab only the `name`, `id`, and `class` attributes from `input` tags.

Sometimes less data might be collected than expected. If you need to collect more data from inputs, you should look into [Custom events and Actions](/docs/user-guides/actions).

### Track across marketing website &amp; app

We recommend putting PostHog both on your homepage and your application if applicable. That means you'll be able to follow a user from the moment they come onto your website, all the way through signup and actually using your product.

> PostHog automatically sets a cross-domain cookie, so if your website is `yourapp.com` and your app is on `app.yourapp.com` users will be followed when they go from one to the other.

### Permitted domains

You can also configure "permitted domains" in your 'Project Settings'. These are domains where you'll be able to record user sessions and use the PostHog toolbar.

### Send custom events with `posthog.capture`

import JSCapture from './snippets/capture.mdx'

<JSCapture />

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on a user, you can use the `posthog.people.set` and `posthog.people.set_once` methods.

However, you can also leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once` to do this via an event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

This works the same way as `posthog.people.set`.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

This works the same way as `posthog.people.set_once`.

### Identifying users

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

import JSIdentify from './snippets/identify.mdx'

<JSIdentify />

#### Multiple IDs

If you use multiple distinct IDs for the same user (e.g. a logical ID and a UUID), you may want to set both for the same user. This way, if PostHog receives events for either ID, it will properly match them to the same person. This is also helpful if you want to associate anonymous IDs with an identified person (we actually do this automatically when you call `.identify`). To associate multiple IDs to the same person, you do an **alias** call, as shown below.

```js
posthog.alias('[distinct ID]', '[alias ID]')
```

Any events sent to either will be received under the same person.

Note: that the `'[alias ID]'` cannot be associated with multiple distinct ids.

### Reset after logout

If a user is logged out, you most likely want to call `reset` to unset any `distinct_ids`.

<blockquote class="warning-note">
    This is especially important if your users are sharing a computer, as otherwise all of those users will be grouped
    together into a single user due to shared cookies between sessions.
</blockquote>

**We strongly recommend you do this on logout even if you don't expect users to share a computer.** This can help make sure all your users are properly tracked in the odd case a user logs in with a different account.

You can do that like so:

```js
posthog.reset()
```

If you _also_ want to reset `device_id`, you can pass `true` as a parameter:

```js
posthog.reset(true)
```

### Sending user information

An ID alone might not be enough to work out which user is who within PostHog. That's why it's useful to send over more metadata of the user. At minimum, we recommend sending the `email` property, which is also what we use to display in PostHog.

You can make this call on every page view to make sure this information is up-to-date. Alternatively, you can also do this whenever a user first appears (after signup) or when they change their information.

```js
posthog.people.set({ email: 'john@gmail.com' })
```

### One-page apps and page views

This JS snippet automatically sends `pageview` events whenever it gets loaded. If you have a one-page app, that means it'll only send a pageview once, when your app loads.

To make sure any navigating a user does within your app gets captured, you can make a pageview call manually.

```js
posthog.capture('$pageview')
```

This will automatically send the current URL.

### Signup example

As an example, here is how to put some of the above concepts together:

```js
function signup(email) {
    // Your own internal logic for creating an account and getting a user_id
    let userId = createAccount(email)

    // Identify user with internal ID
    posthog.identify(userId)
    // Set email or any other data
    posthog.people.set({ email: email })
}
```

### Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a $pageview, an autocaptured button click, or anything else.

They are set using `posthog.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```js
posthog.register({
    'icecream pref': 'vanilla',
    team_id: 22,
})
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"icecream pref": "vanilla"` and `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `icecream_pref = vanilla`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `posthog.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `posthog.people.set`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

Furthermore, if you register the same property multiple times, the next event will use the new value of that property. If you want to register a property only once (e.g. for ad campaign properties) you can use `register_once`, like so:

```js
posthog.register_once({
    'campaign source': 'twitter',
})
```

Using `register_once` will ensure that if a property is already set, it will not be set again. For example, if the user already has property `"icecream pref": "vanilla"`, calling `posthog.register_once({"icecream pref": "chocolate"})` will **not** update the property.

#### Removing stored Super Properties

Setting Super Properties creates a cookie on the client with the respective properties and their values. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events and remove the cookie, you can use `posthog.unregister`, like so:

```js
posthog.unregister('icecream pref')
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

### Opt users out

PostHog JS offers a function to opt users out based on your cookie settings definition (e.g. preferences set via a cookie banner).

This is also the suggested way to prevent capturing _any data_ from the admin on the page, as well as from team members of your organization. A simple way to do this is to access the page as the admin (or any other user on your team you wish to stop capturing data on), and call `posthog.opt_out_capturing();` on the developer console. You can also add this logic in you app and call it directly after an admin/team member logs in.

If you still wish to capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

With PostHog, you can:

Opt a user out:

```js
posthog.opt_out_capturing()
```

See if a user has opted out:

```js
posthog.has_opted_out_capturing()
```

Opt a user back in:

```js
posthog.opt_in_capturing()
```

### Feature Flags

PostHog v1.10.0 introduced [Feature Flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags), which allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features.

Here's how you can use them:

-   Do something when the feature flags load:

    The argument `callback(flags: string[])` will be called when the feature flags are loaded.

    In case the flags are already loaded, it'll be called immediately. Additionally, it will also be called when the flags are re-loaded e.g. after calling `identify` or `reloadFeatureFlags`.

```js
posthog.onFeatureFlags(callback)
```

-   Check if a feature is enabled:

```js
posthog.isFeatureEnabled('keyword')
```

-   Trigger a reload of the feature flags:

```js
posthog.reloadFeatureFlags()
```

-   By default, this function will send a `$feature_flag_called` event to your instance every time it's called so you're able to do analytics. You can disable this by passing the send_event property:

```js
posthog.isFeatureEnabled('keyword', { send_event: false })
```

#### Feature Flag Payloads
Payloads allow you to retrieve a value that is associated with the matched flag. The value can be a
string, boolean, number, dictionary, or array. This allows for custom configurations based on values defined in the posthog app. 

```js
posthog.getFeatureFlagPayload('keyword')
```


#### Bootstrapping Flags

There is a delay between loading the library and feature flags becoming available to use. For some cases, like redirecting users to a different page based on a feature flag, this is extremely detrimental, as the flags load after the redirect logic occurs, thus never working.

In cases like these, where you want flags to be immediately available on page load, you can use the bootstrap library option.

This allows you to pass in a distinctID and feature flags during library initialisation, like so:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    bootstrap: {
        distinctID: 'your-anonymous-id',
        featureFlags: {
            'flag-1': true,
            'variant-flag': 'control',
            'other-flag': false
        }
    }
})
```

To compute these flag values, use the corresponding `getAllFlags` method in your server-side library. Note that bootstrapping flags requires server-side initialisation.

If the ID you're passing in is an identified ID (that is, an ID with which you've called `posthog.identify()` elsewhere), you can also pass in the `isIdentifiedID` bootstrap option, which ensures that this ID is treated as an identified ID in the library. This is helpful as it warns you when you try to do something wrong with this ID, like calling `identify` again.


```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    bootstrap: {
        distinctID: 'your-identified-id',
        isIdentifiedID: true,
        featureFlags: {
            'flag-1': true,
            'variant-flag': 'control',
            'other-flag': false
        }
    }
})
```


> **Note:** Passing in a distinctID to bootstrap replaces any existing IDs, which means you may fail to connect any old anonymous user events with the logged in person, if your logic calls identify in the frontend immediately on login. In this case, you can omit passing in the distinctID.

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-  Associate the events for this session with a group

```js
posthog.group('company', '42dlsfj23f')

posthog.capture("upgraded plan") // this event is associated with company ID `42dlsfj23f`
```

-  Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```js
posthog.group('company', '42dlsfj23f', {
    name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    employees: 11,
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

#### Handling logging out

When the user logs out it's important to call `posthog.reset()` to avoid new events being registered under the previously active group.

#### Integrating groups with feature flags

If you have updated tracking, you can use group-based feature flags as normal.

```js
if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature')) {
    // do something
}
```

To check flag status for a different group, first switch the active group by calling `posthog.group()`.

## Persistence

In order for PostHog to work optimally, we require storing a small amount of information about the user on the user's browser. This ensures that if the user navigates away, and comes back to your site at a later time, we will still identify them properly. We store the following information in the user's browser:

-   User's ID
-   Session ID & Device ID
-   Active & enabled feature flags
-   Any super properties you have defined.
-   Some PostHog configuration options (e.g. whether session recording is enabled)

By default we store all this information in a `cookie`, which means that PostHog will still be able to identify your users even across subdomains. By default, this cookie is set to expire after `365` days.

If you would like to change how PostHog stores this information, you can do so with the `persistence` parameter.

-   `persistence: "cookie"` (default). Everything is stored in a cookie.
-   `persistence: "localStorage+cookie"`. User's distinct ID is stored in a cookie and everything else is stored in the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a>.
-   `persistence: "localStorage"`. Everything is stored in localStorage.
-   `persistence: "memory"`. Stores in page memory, which means data is only persisted for the duration of the page view.

As a note, due to the size limitation of cookies you may run into `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` errors (e.g. if you have a lot of feature flags). In that case, use `localStorage+cookie`.

> **Note: ** Please be aware that localStorage can't be used across subdomains. If you have multiple sites on the same domain, you may want to consider the <code>cookie</code> option or make sure to set all super properties across each subdomain.

If you don't want PostHog to store anything on the user's browser (e.g. if you want to rely on your own identification mechanism only, or want completely anonymous users), you can set `disable_persistence: true` in PostHog's config.
**Warning:** Remember to call `posthog.identify` every time your app loads or every page refresh will be treated as a different user.

## Config

When calling `posthog.init`, there are various configuration options you can set in addition to `loaded` and `api_host`.

To configure these options, pass them as an object to the `posthog.init` call, like so:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    loaded: function (posthog) {
        posthog.identify('[user unique id]')
    },
    autocapture: false,
    // ... more options
})
```

There are multiple different configuration options, most of which you do not have to ever worry about. For brevity, only the most relevant ones are used here. However you can view all the configuration options in [posthog-core.js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/96fa9339b9c553a1c69ec5db9d282f31a65a1c25/src/posthog-core.js#L933).

### Disable `/decide` endpoint

<blockquote>
    This feature was introduced in posthog-js 1.10.0. Previously, disabling autocapture would inherently disable the
    /decide endpoint altogether. This meant that disabling autocapture would inadvertenly turn off session recording,
    feature flags, compression and the toolbar too.
</blockquote>

One of the very first things the PostHog library does when `init()` is called is make a request to the `/decide` endpoint on PostHog's backend. This endpoint contains information on how to run the PostHog library so events are properly received in the backend. This endpoint is required to run most features of the library (detailed below). However, if you're not using any of the described features, you may wish to turn off the call completely to avoid an extra request and reduce resource usage on both the client and the server.

The `/decide` endpoint can be disabled by setting `advanced_disable_decide = true` in PostHog config.

**Resources dependent on `/decide`**

<blockquote class="warning-note">
    These are features/resources that will be fully disabled when the /decide endpoint is disabled.
</blockquote>

-   **Autocapture**. The `/decide` endpoint contains information on whether autocapture should be enabled or not (apart from local configuration).
-   **Session recording**. The endpoint contains information on where to send relevant session recording events.
-   **Compression**. The endpoint contains information on what compression methods are supported on the backend (e.g. LZ64, gzip) for event payloads.
-   **Feature flags**. The endpoint contains the feature flags enabled for the current person.
-   **Toolbar**. The endpoint contains authentication information and other toolbar capabilities information required to run it.

Any custom event capturing (`posthog.capture`), `$identify`, `$set`, `$set_once` and basically any other calls not detailed above will work as expected when `/decide` is disabled.

## Debugging

In your dev console you can run `posthog.debug()`. This will enable debugging, easily allowing you to see all data that is being sent to PostHog.

## Development

For instructions on how to run `posthog-js` locally and setup your development environment, please checkout the README on the [posthog-js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js#README) repository.

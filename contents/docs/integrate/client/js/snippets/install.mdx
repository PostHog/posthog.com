import Snippet from "../../../snippet.mdx"

You can either load the snippet as a script in your HTML:

<Snippet />

Place the snippet in the `<head>` tags of your website, ideally just above the closing `</head>` tag. You will need to do this for all pages that you wish to track.

Or you can include it using npm, by doing either:

```bash
yarn add posthog-js
```

or:

```bash
npm install --save posthog-js
```

And then include it in your files:

```js
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_instance_address>' })
```

If you don't want to send a bunch of test data while you're developing, you could do the following:

```js
if (!window.location.href.includes('127.0.0.1')) {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_instance_address>' })
}
```

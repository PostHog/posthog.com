When you call `posthog.init` the PostHog JS library begins automatically capturing user events:

- **pageviews**, including the URL
- **autocaptured events**, such as any click, change of input, or submission associated with `a`, `button`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, and `label` tags

Autocapture allows you to track the majority of general events on your website right out of the gate

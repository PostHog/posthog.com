This allows you to send more context than the default event info that PostHog captures whenever a user does something. In that case, you can send an event with any metadata you may wish to add.

```javascript
posthog.capture('[event-name]', {property1: 'value', property2: 'another value'});
```

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on a user, you can use the `posthog.people.set` and `posthog.people.set_once` methods.

However, you can also leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once` to do this via an event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } });
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

This works the same way as `posthog.people.set`.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } });
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

This works the same way as `posthog.people.set_once`.

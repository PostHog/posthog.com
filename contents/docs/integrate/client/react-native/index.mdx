Purely built for React Native, this library allows you to integrate PostHog with your React Native project. For React Native projects built with Expo, there are no mobile native dependencies outside of supported Expo packages.


## Installation

import ReactNativeInstall from './snippets/install.mdx'

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Configuration

import ReactNativeConfigure from './snippets/configure.mdx'

<ReactNativeConfigure />

## Usage

### Autocapture

Autocapture tracks these events:

* **Application Opened** - once when the App is opened from a closed state
* **Application Became Active** - when the App comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
* **Application Backgrounded** - when the App is sent to the background by the user
* **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using @react-navigation/native)
* **$autocapture** - touch events when the user interacts with the screen

With Autocapture, all touch events for children of `PosthogProvider` will be tracked, capturing a snapshot of the view hierarchy at that point. This allows you to create Insights in PostHog without having to add many custom events.

PostHog will try to generate a sensible name for the touched element based on the React component `displayName` or `name` but you can force this to something reliable (and also clearly marked for posthog tracking) using the `ph-label` prop.

```jsx
<View ph-label="my-special-label"></View>
```

If there are elements you don't want to be captured, you can add the `ph-no-capture` property like so. If this property is found anywhere in the view hierarchy, the entire touch event is ignored.

```jsx
<View ph-no-capture>Sensitive view here</View>
```

Basic usage:
```jsx
// App.(js|ts)
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'
import {NavigationContainer} from '@react-navigation/native';

export function App() {
    return (
        <NavigationContainer>
            <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" autocapture>
                {/* Rest of app */}
            </PostHogProvider>
        </NavigationContainer>
    )
}
```

You can tweak how autocapture works by passing custom options.

```jsx
<PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" autocapture={{
    captureTouches: true, // If you don't want to capture touch events set this to false
    captureLifecycleEvents: true, // If you don't want to capture the Lifecycle Events (e.g. Application Opened) set this to false
    captureScreens: true, // If you don't want to capture screen events set this to false
    ignoreLabels: [], // Any labels here will be ignored from the stack in touch events
    customLabelProp: "ph-label",
    noCaptureProp: "ph-no-capture",

    navigation: {
        // By default only the Screen name is tracked but it is possible to track the 
        // params or modify the name by intercepting theautocapture like so
        routeToName: (name, params) => {
            if (params.id) return `${name}/${params.id}`
            return name
        },
        routeToParams: (name, params) => {
            if (name === "SensitiveScreen) return undefined
            return params
        },
    }
}}>
    ...
</PostHogProvider>
```

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

#### Setting user properties via an event

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.



### Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a $screen, an autocaptured touch, or anything else.

They are set using `posthog.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```js
posthog.register({
    'icecream pref': 'vanilla',
    team_id: 22,
})
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"icecream pref": "vanilla"` and `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `icecream_pref = vanilla`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `posthog.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `posthog.identify`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

#### Removing stored Super Properties

Super Properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events, you can use `posthog.unregister`, like so:

```js
posthog.unregister('icecream pref'),
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply use `posthog.reset` which takes care of clearing all stored Super Properties and more.



### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have gathered.

You can also manually flush the queue, like so:

```javascript
posthog.flush()
// or using async/await
await posthog.flushAsync()
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```javascript
posthog.reset()
```

### Opt in/out

By default, PostHog has tracking enabled unless it is forcefully disabled by default using the option `{ enable: false }`.

You can give your users the option to opt in or out by calling the relevant methods. Once these have been called they are persisted and will be respected until optIn/Out is called again or the `reset` function is called.

To Opt in/out of tracking, use the following calls. 

```javascript
posthog.optIn() // opt in
posthog.optOut() // opt out
```

If you still wish capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

### Feature Flags

Feature Flags can be loaded directly or via a helpful hook

```js
import { useFeatureFlag } from "posthog-react-native"

const MyComponent = () => {
    const showFlaggedFeature = useFeatureFlag("my-flag-id")
    const multiVariantFeature = useFeatureFlag("my-multivariant-feature-flag-id")

    if (showFlaggedFeature === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    }

    return showFlaggedFeature ? (
        <Text>Testing feature 😄</Text>
    ) : (
        <Text>Not Testing feature 😢</Text>
    )
}
```

Alternatively you can call load the feature flags directly:
```js
// Defaults to undefined if not loaded yet or if there was a problem loading
posthog.getFeatureFlag("my-flag")
// Multi variant feature flags are returned as a string
posthog.getFeatureFlag("my-multivariant-flag") 

```

PostHog will load feature flags when instantiated and will refresh whenever other methods are called that could affect the flag such as `.group()`. If you have the need to forcefully trigger the refresh however you can use `reloadFeatureFlagsAsync` 
```js
posthog.reloadFeatureFlagsAsync()
  .then(refreshedFlags => console.log(refreshedFlags))
```



#### Bootstrapping Flags

There is a delay between loading the library and feature flags becoming available to use. For some cases, like redirecting users to a different page based on a feature flag, this is extremely detrimental, as the flags load after the redirect logic occurs, thus never working.

In cases like these, where you want flags to be immediately available on page load, you can use the bootstrap library option.

This allows you to pass in a distinctID and feature flags during library initialisation, like so:


```js
const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    bootstrap: {
        distinctID: 'your-anonymous-id',
        featureFlags: {
            'flag-1': true,
            'variant-flag': 'control',
            'other-flag': false
        }
    }
})
```

To compute these flag values, use the corresponding `getAllFlags` method in your server-side library. Note that bootstrapping flags requires server-side initialisation.

If the ID you're passing in is an identified ID (that is, an ID with which you've called `posthog.identify()` elsewhere), you can also pass in the `isIdentifiedID` bootstrap option, which ensures that this ID is treated as an identified ID in the library. This is helpful as it warns you when you try to do something wrong with this ID, like calling `identify` again.


```js
const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    bootstrap: {
        distinctID: 'your-identified-id',
        isIdentifiedID: true,
        featureFlags: {
            'flag-1': true,
            'variant-flag': 'control',
            'other-flag': false
        }
    }
})
```


### Group analytics

PostHog 1.31.0 introduced support for [group analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics), which allows you to associate users and events with larger groups (teams, organizations, etc.).

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Make a group active and update properties

```js
posthog.group('company', 'id:5', {
    company_name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    employees: 11,
})
```

-   Make a group active without updating properties

```js
posthog.group('company', 'id:77')
```

Once a group has been made active, all subsequent events that are sent using the client will be associated with that group automatically.



### Sending screen views

With the `PostHogProvider`, screen tracking is automatically captured if the `autocapture` property is used. Currently only [@react-navigation/native](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) is supported by autocapture and it is important that the `PostHogProvider` is configured as a child of the `NavigationContainer` as below:

See [autocapture](#autocapture) for configuration.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function. This function requires a `name`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```javascript

posthog.screen('Dashboard', {
    background: 'blue',
    hero: 'superhog',
})
```

## Upgrading from V1 to V2

V1 of this library utilised the underlying `posthog-ios` and `posthog-android` SDKs to do most of the work. Since the new version is written entirely in JS, using only Expo supported libraries, there are some changes to the way PostHog is configured as well as actually calling PostHog.

For iOS, the new React Native SDK will attempt to migrate the previously peristed data which should result in no unexpected changes to tracked data.

For Android, it is unfortunately not possible for persisted Android data to be loaded which means stored information such as the randomly generated `anonymousId` or the `distinctId` set by `posthog.identify` will not be present. For identified users, the simple workaround is to ensure that `identify` is called at least once when the app loads. For anonymous users there is unfortunately no straightforward workaround they will show up as new anonymous users in PostHog.

```jsx
// DEPRECATED V1 Setup

import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

await PostHog.setup('phc_ChmcdLbC770zgl23gp3Lax6SERzC2szOUxtp0Uy4nTf', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    captureApplicationLifecycleEvents: false, // Replaced by `PostHogProvider`
    captureDeepLinks: false, // No longer supported
    recordScreenViews: false, // Replaced by `PostHogProvider` supporting @react-navigation/native
    flushInterval: 30, // Stays the same
    flushAt: 20, // Stays the same
    android: {...}, // No longer needed
    iOS: {...}, // No longer needed
})

PostHog.capture("foo")


// V2 Setup difference
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

const posthog = new PostHog('phc_ChmcdLbC770zgl23gp3Lax6SERzC2szOUxtp0Uy4nTf', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    // Add any other options here.
})

// Use created instance rather than the PostHog class
posthog.capture("foo")
```

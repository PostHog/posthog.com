<VisitLibrary name="React Native" to="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-react-native" />

This is an optional library you can install if you're working with React Native. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, 
making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

## Installation

import ReactNativeInstall from './snippets/install.mdx'

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Configuration

import ReactNativeConfigure from './snippets/configure.mdx'

<ReactNativeConfigure />

## Making calls

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

import ReactNativeIdentify from './snippets/identify.mdx'

<ReactNativeIdentify />

### Capture

import ReactNativeCapture from './snippets/capture.mdx'

<ReactNativeCapture />

#### Setting user properties via an event

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
PostHog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } });
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.


##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
PostHog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } });
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing. 
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have gathered.

You can also manually flush the queue, like so:

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.flush()
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.reset()
```

### Opt in/out

To Opt in/out of tracking, use the following calls:

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.enable() // opt in
PostHog.disable() // opt out
```

This is the suggested way to prevent capturing data from the admin on the page, as well as from team members of your organization. A simple way to do this is to access the page as the admin (or any other user on your team you wish to stop capturing data on), and call `posthog.opt_out_capturing();` on the developer console. You can also add this logic in you app and call it directly after an admin/team member logs in. 

If you still wish to capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

### Sending screen views

With `recordScreenViews`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

This function requires a `name`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.screen("Dashboard", {
    background: 'blue',
    hero: 'superhog'
})
```

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-react-native` package.

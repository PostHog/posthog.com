Purely built for React Native, this library allows you to integrate PostHog with your React Native project. For React Native projects built with Expo, there are no mobile native dependencies outside of supported Expo packages.


## Installation

import ReactNativeInstall from './snippets/install.mdx'

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Configuration

import ReactNativeConfigure from './snippets/configure.mdx'

<ReactNativeConfigure />

## Usage

### Autocapture

Autocapture tracks these events:

* `Application Opened` - once when the App is opened from a closed state
* `Application Became Active` - when the App comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
* `Application Backgrounded` - when the App is sent to the background by the user
* `Keyboard Shown` - when the keyboard appears for user input
* `Keyboard Hidden` - when the keyboard is dismissed from user input
* `$screen` - when the user navigates (if using @react-navigation/native)
* `$autocapture` - touch events when the user interacts with the screen

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

import ReactNativeIdentify from './snippets/identify.mdx'

<ReactNativeIdentify />

### Capture

import ReactNativeCapture from './snippets/capture.mdx'

<ReactNativeCapture />

#### Setting user properties via an event

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have gathered.

You can also manually flush the queue, like so:

```javascript
posthog.flush()
// or using async/await
await posthig.flushAsync()
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```javascript
posthog.reset()
```

### Opt in/out

By default, PostHog has tracking enabled unless it is forcefully disabled by default using the option `{ enable: false }`.

You can give your users the option to opt in or out by calling the relevant methods. Once these have been called they are persisted and will be respected until optIn/Out is called again or the `reset` function is called.

To Opt in/out of tracking, use the following calls. 

```javascript
posthog.optIn() // opt in
posthog.optOut() // opt out
```

If you still wish capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

### Feature Flags

Feature Flags can be loaded directly or via a helpful hook

```js
import { useFeatureFlag } from "posthog-react-native"


const MyComponent = () => {
    const showFlaggedFeature = useFeatureFlag("my-flag-id")
    const multiVariantFeature = useFeatureFlag("my-multivariant-feature-flag-id")

    if (showFlaggedFeature === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    }

    return showFlaggedFeature ? (
        <Text>Testing feature ðŸ˜„</Text>
    ) : (
        <Text>Not Testing feature ðŸ˜¢</Text>
    )
}


You can give your users the option to opt in or out by calling the relevant methods. Once these have been called they are persisted and will be respected until optIn/Out is called again or the `reset` function is called.

To Opt in/out of tracking, use the following calls. 

```javascript
posthog.optIn() // opt in
posthog.optOut() // opt out
```

If you still wish capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).


### Sending screen views

With the `PostHogProvider`, screen tracking is automatically captured if the `autocapture` property is used. Currently only [@react-navigation/native](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) is supported by autocapture and it is important that the `PostHogProvider` is configured as a child of the `NavigationContainer` as below:

```jsx
// App.(js|ts)
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'
import {NavigationContainer} from '@react-navigation/native';

export function App() {
    return (
        <NavigationContainer>
            <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" autocapture>
                <MyApp.Navigator>
                    <MyApp.Screen
                        name="Home"
                        component={HomeScreen}
                    />
              </MyApp.Navigator>
            </PostHogProvider>
        </NavigationContainer>
    )
}
```

By default only the Screen name is tracked but it is possible to track the params or modify the name by intercepting the autocapture like so:

```jsx
<PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" autocapture={{
    navigation: {
        routeToName: (name, params) => {
            if (params.id) return `${name}/${params.id}`
            return name
        },
        routeToParams: (name, params) => {
            if (name === "SensitiveScreen) return undefined
            return params
        },
    }
}}>
    ...
</PostHogProvider>
```


If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

This function requires a `name`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```javascript

posthog.screen('Dashboard', {
    background: 'blue',
    hero: 'superhog',
})
```

## Upgrading from V1 to V2

This library is largely based on the `analytics-react-native` package.

First make sure you have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed. 
[See here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies) for React Native specific instructions.

Then add the `posthog-react-native` package to your project:

```bash
yarn add posthog-react-native
```

Then link the native libraries:

```bash
yarn react-native link
```

If you're building for iOS, also make sure you have the latest PostHog iOS Pod installed: 

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

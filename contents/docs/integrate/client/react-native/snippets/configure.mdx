Setup the PostHog React native SDK as follows:

```js
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

await PostHog.setup('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    // PostHog API host
    host: '<ph_instance_address>',

    // Record certain application events automatically! (off/false by default)
    captureApplicationLifecycleEvents: true,

    // Capture deep links as part of the screen call. (off by default)
    captureDeepLinks: true,

    // Record screen views automatically! (off/false by default)
    recordScreenViews: true,

    // Max delay before flushing the queue (30 seconds)
    flushInterval: 30,

    // Maximum number of events to keep in queue before flushing (20)
    flushAt: 20,

    // Used only for Android
    android: {
        // Enable or disable collection of ANDROID_ID (true)
        collectDeviceId: true,
    },

    // Used only for iOS
    iOS: {
        // Automatically capture in-app purchases from the App Store
        captureInAppPurchases: false,

        // Capture push notifications
        capturePushNotifications: false,

        // The maximum number of items to queue before starting to drop old ones.
        maxQueueSize: 1000,

        // Record bluetooth information.
        shouldUseBluetooth: false,

        // Use location services. Will ask for permissions.
        shouldUseLocationServices: false
    }
})
```

See the [iOS integration](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/client/ios) and 
[Android integration](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/client/android) pages for more details on
some of these options.

The `PostHog.setup()` call returns a promise, which resolves once the initialisation
has finished. All calls to functions (e.g. `capture`) will be queued and dispatched once
initialisation has finished.

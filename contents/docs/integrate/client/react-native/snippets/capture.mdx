Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find 
patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

* `event` to specify the event name
  * We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

* `properties`, which is an object with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```javascript
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

PostHog.capture('Button B Clicked', {
    color: "blue",
    icon: "new2-final"
})
```


#### Setting user properties via an event

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
PostHog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } });
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.


##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
PostHog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } });
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

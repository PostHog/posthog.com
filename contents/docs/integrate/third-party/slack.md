PostHog integrates with Slack to send notifications to channels of your choice via **Subscriptions**.


> ðŸ¤” Webhooks for Events or Actions are currently configured differently. [See Slack Webhooks](/docs/integrate/webhooks/slack) for more info. 

### Getting started with Slack

> ðŸš§ For Self-hosted plans, you need to have first configured the Slack App in [instance settings](/docs/self-host/configure/slack).

To get started, go to [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) and under the **Slack** section you will find a button to add the PostHog App to your Slack workspace of choice 

![Add to Slack button](../../../images/features/slack/project-settings-add-slack.png)

You will be redirected to Slack and prompted to understand what permissions you are giving PostHog. You can select your workspace from the top-right and upon pressing **Allow** will be redirected back to PostHog.

With that Slack is configured for your project! You can now [create a Subscription](/docs/user-guides/subscriptions#slack-subscriptions) and start getting Insights delivered to your favorite channels


### Troubleshooting

#### I can't select my Slack channel or I am not receiving Subscriptions

In order for the PostHog Slack App to send messages to a channel it needs to be first added to it. To do this you can type `/invite` in the relevant channel and then select `Add Apps to this channel` which will then allow you to search for the PostHog app and add it.

In addition to events having properties, users can also have properties. There are two different methods that can be used: `set` and `set_once`. Depending on the integration library the actual function calls look a bit different, but internally they all work the same way.

## When to use `set` and `set_once`?

Use `set`, when the value should always be the newest one, e.g. user email, if user does an update to their email, we always want to use the latest value.

Use `set_once` when we want the first value and it to never be updated afterwards, e.g. initial URL for the first URL we ever saw this user on.

Sometimes we might want to mix `set` and `set_once` usage. Imagine, when we have some heuristics that help us determine a value, but users can also specify it. In these cases it might be beneficial to use `set_once` for the heuristically computed value and `set` for user specified value. Note that we will never override an existing value if `set_once` is used, so if heuristics are used on a continuous basis that would not be a good strategy.

## How do values get overridden?

**The section below explains how overrides will work in the future, but currently overrides ignore timestamps. This means at the moment `set` always overrides, `set_once` only writes when the value doesn't exist and `alias` upon property name conflict uses the value from person 1.**

We rely on timestamps to know the order in which events happened. Note that we don't use ingestion order because events can arrive to PostHog in different order compared to when they were performed, e.g. when network was unreliable and some packets were resent later or when we're importing older events from a different PostHog instance.

This table explains, when values get overridden (TS means timestamp):


| | value exists | method   | previous method | previous TS is ___ call TS | write/override 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 1 | no  | N/A      | N/A             | N/A                        | yes 
 2 | yes | set      | set             | before                     | yes
 3 | yes | set | set_once | before | yes
 4 | yes | set | set | equal | no
 5 | yes | set | set_once | equal | yes 
 6 | yes | set | set | after | no
 7 | yes | set | set_once | after | yes 
 8 | yes | set_once | set | before | no 
 9 | yes | set_once | set_once | before | no
10 | yes | set_once | set | equal | no 
11 | yes | set_once | set_once | equal | no
12 | yes | set_once | set | after | no
13 | yes | set_once | set_once | after | yes


When `identify` or `alias` methods are used, then all user properties individually get merged based on the same logic. 

P1 refers to Person or 1's property and P2 to Person or distinct id 2's property. Notice how "yes" from above turned into "2".


|   | P1 exists | P2 exists | P2 method | P1 method | P1 TS is ___ P2 TS | value used
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 0 | yes       | no        | N/A       | N/A       | N/A                | 1
 1 | no        | yes       | N/A       | N/A       | N/A                | 2
 2 | yes       | yes       | set       | set       | before             | 2
 3 | yes       | yes       | set       | set_once  | before             | 2
 4 | yes       | yes       | set       | set       | equal              | 1 or 2
 5 | yes       | yes       | set       | set_once  | equal              | 2 
 6 | yes       | yes       | set       | set       | after              | 1
 7 | yes       | yes       | set       | set_once  | after              | 2 
 8 | yes       | yes       | set_once  | set       | before             | 1 
 9 | yes       | yes       | set_once  | set_once  | before             | 1
10 | yes       | yes       | set_once  | set       | equal              | 1 
11 | yes       | yes       | set_once  | set_once  | equal              | 1 or 2
12 | yes       | yes       | set_once  | set       | after              | 1
13 | yes       | yes       | set_once  | set_once  | after              | 2


> **Note:** Here with equal timestamps and the current call (set/set_once) equal to the previous (rows 4 and 11) this means that we could end up using either person's value. We will optimize for efficiency here to minimize database writes (similarly to why set/set_once doesn't override). To elaborate look at the following examples:

For `identify` this series of calls would mean we end up with `location` being `Rome` or `New York`.
```js
posthog.set('Alice', {'location': 'Rome'}, timestamp=1)
posthog.identify('Alice', {'$set': {'location': 'New York'}}, timestamp=1)
```

For `alias` this series of calls would also mean we end up with `location` being `Rome` or `New York`.
```js
posthog.set('Alice 1', {'location': 'Rome'}, timestamp=1)
posthog.set('Alice 2', {'location': 'New York'}, timestamp=1)
posthog.alias('Alice 1', 'Alice 2', timestamp=1000)
```

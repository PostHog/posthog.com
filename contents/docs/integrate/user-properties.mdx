## Setting properties

To update the properties of a user you can use `identify`, `set`, `set_once`, and `$unset`. Depending on the integration library the actual function calls look a bit different, but internally they all work the same way.

- `identify`: Identify the user and set the properties
```js
posthog.identify('user_id', {
    name: 'James PostHog', // also sets the display name in the PostHog UI
    email: 'hey@posthog.com', // if there's no name, used as the display name in the PostHog UI
})
```

- `set`: Set the property even if the property exists on the person
```js
posthog.people.set( { location: 'London'  })

// { location: 'London' }
```

- `set_once`: Update the property if the property does not exist on the person
```js
posthog.people.set_once( { initial_location: 'Rome'})
posthog.people.set_once( { initial_location: 'London'})

// { initial_location: 'Rome' }
```

// TODO: the unset property doesn't seem to exist?
- `unset`: Remove a property from a user if exists
```js
posthog.people.unset('location')
```

All these methods can be used in properties with normal event capture:

- Set the properties through a capture
```js
posthog.capture(
    'Set some user properties', 
    { 
        $set: { location: 'London'  },
        $set_once: { initial_location: 'London' },
        $unset: [ 'priority' ],
    }
```

## When to use `set` and `set_once`?

Use `set` when we want the value should always be the newest one. For example, to update the email for a user.

Use `set_once` when we want to set the first value and it to never be updated afterwards, e.g. the first URL that referred a user to the site.

In summary: `set` always overrides, `set_once` only writes when the property doesn't already exist on the user.

For example:
```js
posthog.people.set( { location: 'London'  })
posthog.people.set( { location: 'Rome'  })

// { location: 'Rome' }

posthog.people.set_once( { initial_location: 'London'  })
posthog.people.set_once( { initial_location: 'Rome'  })

// { location: 'London' }
```

Sometimes we might want to use both `set` and `set_once` usage. Imagine, when we have some heuristics that help us determine a value, but users can also specify it. In these cases it might be beneficial to use `set_once` for the heuristically computed value and `set` for user specified value. This way we can ensure that the user specified value is always used, but if the user doesn't specify it, we can still use the heuristically computed value.

## How are properties managed when merging or aliasing users

// TODO: Confirm this with Tiina. Is this what this section means: https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/user-properties#how-do-values-get-overridden

When two users both contain a property and are merged, the property of the first user (i.e. the distinctId for the alias) are used.
```js
// this uses the node sdk
client.identify({
    distinctId: 'main_id',
    properties: {
        location: 'London',
    },
})

client.identify({
    distinctId: 'secondary_id',
    properties: {
        location: 'Rome',
    },
})

posthog.alias({
    distinctId: 'main_id',
    alias: 'secondary_id',
})

// for user 'main_id', { location: 'London' }
```

## Default user properties

If the `name` is not set, the `email` is used as the name in the PostHog UI.

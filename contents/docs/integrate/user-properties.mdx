In addition to events having properties, users can also have properties. There are two different methods that can be used: `set` and `set_once`. Depending on the integration library the actual function calls look a bit different, but internally they all work the same way. Note that both methods can be used in properties with normal event capture, e.g. using our [js library](/docs/integrate/client/js):
```js
posthog.capture(
    'Set some user properties', 
    { 
        $set: { location: 'London'  },
        $set_once: { referred_by: 'some ID' },
    }
```

## When to use `set` and `set_once`?

Use `set`, when the value should always be the newest one, e.g. user email, if user does an update to their email, we always want to use the latest value.

Use `set_once` when we want the first value and it to never be updated afterwards, e.g. initial URL for the first URL we ever saw this user on.

Sometimes we might want to mix `set` and `set_once` usage. Imagine, when we have some heuristics that help us determine a value, but users can also specify it. In these cases it might be beneficial to use `set_once` for the heuristically computed value and `set` for user specified value. Note that we will never override an existing value if `set_once` is used, so if heuristics are used on a continuous basis that would not be a good strategy.

## How do values get overridden?

`set` always overrides, `set_once` only writes when the value doesn't exist.

`identify` and `alias` upon name conflict use the value the first user provided. This series of calls would mean we end up with `location` being `Rome`:
```python
posthog.capture('anon', event='set location', properties={'$set': {'location': 'Paris'}})
posthog.capture('Alice', event='set location', properties={'$set_once': {'location': 'Rome'}})
posthog.alias('Alice', 'anon')
```

Note that we ignore the event timestamps and just process everything at ingestion time.

> **Warning:** This create is still under development and is not recommended for production use yet.

## Installation

Install the `posthog-rs` create by adding it to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml file=Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
posthog-rs = "0.2.0"
```

## Usage

To setup the client, all you need to do is pass your PostHog project key.

```rust
let client = posthog_rs::client(env!("POSTHOG_API_KEY"));
```

> **Note:** Currently, there is no way to customize the host that events are sent to, and we default to `app.posthog.com`

### Capturing events

Currently, the only functionality this library supports is sending events, which can be done using the `capture` and `cature_batch` methods.

```rust
let mut event = Event::new("<event_name>", "<distinct_id>");

event.insert_prop("key1", "value1").unwrap();
event.insert_prop("key2", vec!["a", "b"]).unwrap();

client.capture(event).unwrap();
```

```rust
let event1 = posthog_rs::Event::new("event 1", "1234");
let event2 = posthog_rs::Event::new("event 2", "1234");

client.capture_batch(vec![event1, event2]).unwrap();
```

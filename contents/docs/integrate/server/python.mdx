[Click here](https://github.com/posthog/posthog-python) for the Posthog Python Library. This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Python. 

This page of the Docs refers specifically to the Official PostHog Python Library to capture and send events to any PostHog instance (including posthog.com).

This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation 

```bash
pip install posthog
```

In your app, import the `posthog` library and set your api key and host **before** making any calls.

```python
import posthog

# Substitutes posthog.api_key which still exists but has been deprecated
posthog.project_api_key = '<ph_project_api_key>'

# Only necessary if you want to use feature flags
posthog.personal_api_key = '<ph_personal_api_key>'

# You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com
posthog.host = '<ph_instance_address>'
```

You can read more about the differences between the project and personal API keys in the dedicated [API Authentication section](/docs/api/overview#authentication) of the Docs. 

> **Note:** As a general rule of thumb, we do not recommend having API keys in plaintext. Setting it as an environment variable would be best.

You can find your keys in the 'Project Settings' page in PostHog.

To debug, you can toggle debug mode on:
```python
posthog.debug = True
```

And to make sure no calls happen during your tests, you can disable them, like so:
```python
if settings.TEST:
    posthog.disabled = True
```

## Making Calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:
 - `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
 - `event name` to specify the event
  * We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:
- `properties`, which is a dictionary with any information you'd like to add
- `timestamp`, a datetime object for when the event happened. If this isn't submitted, it'll be set to the current time

For example:
```python
posthog.capture('distinct id', 'movie played', {'movie_id': '123', 'category': 'romcom'})
```

or

```python
posthog.capture('distinct id', event='movie played', properties={'movie_id': '123', 'category': 'romcom'}, timestamp=datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=tzutc())
```

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

**Example**

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct id', 
    event='movie played', 
    properties={ '$set': { 'userProperty': 'value' } }
)
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct id', 
    event='movie played', 
    properties={ '$set_once': { 'userProperty': 'value' } }
)
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Identify

Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things 
like segment users by these properties.

An `identify` call requires:
- `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
- `properties` with a dict with any key:value pairs 

For example:
```python
posthog.identify('distinct id', {
    'email': 'dwayne@gmail.com',
    'name': 'Dwayne Johnson'
})
```

The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their information.

### Alias

To connect whatever a user does before they sign up or log in with what they do after you need to make an alias call. This will allow you to answer questions like "Which marketing channels leads to users churning after a month?" or "What do users do on our website before signing up?"

In a purely back-end implementation, this means whenever an anonymous user does something, you'll want to send a session ID ([Django](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/526179/in-django-how-can-i-find-out-the-request-session-sessionid-and-use-it-as-a-vari), [Flask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15156132/flask-login-how-to-get-session-id)) with the capture call. Then, when that users signs up, you want to do an alias call with the session ID and the newly created user ID.

The same concept applies for when a user logs in.

If you're using PostHog in the front-end and back-end, doing the `identify` call in the frontend will be enough.

An `alias` call requires:
- `previous distinct id` the unique ID of the user before
- `distinct id` the current unique id

For example:
```python
posthog.alias('anonymous session id', 'distinct id')
```

### Feature Flags

> **Note:** To use feature flags you must also set a `personal_api_key` when configuring the integration, as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

PostHog's [Feature Flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features.

When using them with one of libraries, you should check if a feature flag is enabled and use the result to toggle functionality on and off in you application.

**How to check if a flag is enabled**

```python
posthog.feature_enabled('beta-feature', 'distinct id')
```

**Example Use Case**

Here's how you might send different users a different version of your homepage, for example:

```python
def homepage(request):
    template = "new.html" if posthog.feature_enabled('new_ui', 'distinct id') else "old.html"
    return render_template(template, request=request)
```

> **Note:** Feature flags are persistent for users across sessions. Read more about feature flag persistence on our [dedicated page](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags#feature-flag-persistence). 

### Sending Page Views

If you're aiming for a full back-end implementation of PostHog, you can send `pageviews` from your backend

```python
posthog.capture('distinct id', '$pageview', {'$current_url': 'https://example.com'})
```

## Django

For Django, you can do the initialisation of the key in the AppConfig, so that it's available everywhere.

in `yourapp/apps.py`
```python
from django.apps import AppConfig
import posthog

class YourAppConfig(AppConfig):
    def ready(self):
        posthog.api_key = '<ph_project_api_key>'
        posthog.host = '<ph_instance_address>' # You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com

```

Then, anywhere else in your app you can do:
```python
import posthog

def purchase(request):
    # example capture
    posthog.capture(request.user.pk, 'purchase', ...)
```

# Integrations

## Sentry

When using [Sentry in Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/), you can connect to PostHog in order to link Sentry errors to PostHog user profiles. 

### Example Implementation

```python
from posthog.sentry import update_posthog

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
    before_send=update_posthog
)

# Also set `posthog_distinct_id` tag
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_tag('posthog_distinct_id', 'some distinct id')
```

### Example Implementation with Django

This can be made automatic in Dejango, by adding the following middleware and settings to `settings.py`:

```python

MIDDLEWARE = [
    "posthog.sentry.django.PosthogDistinctIdMiddleware"
]

POSTHOG_DJANGO = {
    "distinct_id": lambda request: request.user and request.user.distinct_id
}
```

## Alternative Name

As our open source project [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) shares the same module name, we created a special `posthoganalytics` package, mostly for internal use to avoid module collision. It is the exact same.

## Thank You

This library is largely based on the `analytics-python` package.

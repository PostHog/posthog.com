This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Python. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation

```bash
pip install posthog
```

In your app, import the `posthog` library and set your api key and host **before** making any calls.

```python
import posthog

# Substitutes posthog.api_key which still exists but has been deprecated
posthog.project_api_key = '<ph_project_api_key>'

# Only necessary if you want to use feature flags
posthog.personal_api_key = '<ph_personal_api_key>'

# You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com
posthog.host = '<ph_instance_address>'
```

You can read more about the differences between the project and personal API keys in the dedicated [API authentication section](/docs/api/overview#authentication) of the Docs.

> **Note:** As a general rule of thumb, we do not recommend having API keys in plaintext. Setting it as an environment variable would be best.

You can find your keys in the 'Project Settings' page in PostHog.

To debug, you can toggle debug mode on:

```python
posthog.debug = True
```

And to make sure no calls happen during your tests, you can disable them, like so:

```python
if settings.TEST:
    posthog.disabled = True
```

## Making Calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

-   `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
-   `event name` to specify the event

*   We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

-   `properties`, which is a dictionary with any information you'd like to add
-   `timestamp`, a datetime object for when the event happened. If this isn't submitted, it'll be set to the current time
-   `uuid`, a unique `uuid` for the event, leave blank to autogenerate
-   `send_feature_flags`, a boolean that determines whether to send current known feature flags with this event. This is useful when running experiments which depends on this event. However, this makes things slow. [Read this tutorial for manually computing this information and speeding things up](/tutorials/experiments#step-2-sending-the-right-events)

For example:

```python
posthog.capture('distinct id', 'movie played', {'movie_id': '123', 'category': 'romcom'})
```

or

```python
posthog.capture('distinct id', event='movie played', properties={'movie_id': '123', 'category': 'romcom'}, timestamp=datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=tzutc()))
```

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

**Example**

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct id',
    event='movie played',
    properties={ '$set': { 'userProperty': 'value' } }
)
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct id',
    event='movie played',
    properties={ '$set_once': { 'userProperty': 'value' } }
)
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things
like segment users by these properties.

An `identify` call requires:

-   `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
-   `properties` with a dict with any key:value pairs

For example:

```python
posthog.identify('distinct id', {
    'email': 'dwayne@gmail.com',
    'name': 'Dwayne Johnson'
})
```

The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their information.

### Alias

To connect whatever a user does before they sign up or log in with what they do after you need to make an alias call. This will allow you to answer questions like "Which marketing channels leads to users churning after a month?" or "What do users do on our website before signing up?"

In a purely back-end implementation, this means whenever an anonymous user does something, you'll want to send a session ID ([Django](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/526179/in-django-how-can-i-find-out-the-request-session-sessionid-and-use-it-as-a-vari), [Flask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15156132/flask-login-how-to-get-session-id)) with the capture call. Then, when that users signs up, you want to do an alias call with the session ID and the newly created user ID.

The same concept applies for when a user logs in.

If you're using PostHog in the front-end and back-end, doing the `identify` call in the frontend will be enough.

An `alias` call requires:

-   `distinct id` – the user id
-   `alias` – the anonymous session distinct ID

For example:
```python
posthog.alias('user:123', 'session:12345');
```

### Feature flags

PostHog's [Feature Flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) allow you to safely deploy and roll back new features.

When using them with one of libraries, you should check if a feature flag is enabled and use the result to toggle functionality on and off in you application.

**How to check if a flag is enabled**

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `None`, instead of `true`, `false`, or a string variant value.


```python
posthog.feature_enabled('beta-feature', 'distinct id')
# returns True or False or None
```

**Example use case**

Here's how you might send different users a different version of your homepage, for example:

```python
def homepage(request):
    template = "new.html" if posthog.feature_enabled('new_ui', 'distinct id') else "old.html"
    return render_template(template, request=request)
```

> **Note:** Feature flags are persistent for users across sessions. Read more about feature flag persistence on our [dedicated page](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags#feature-flag-persistence).

**Get a flag value**

If you're using multivariate feature flags, you can also get not just whether the flag is enabled, but what value its enabled to.

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `None`, instead of `true`, `false`, or a string variant value.


```python
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id')
# returns string or True or False or None
```

**Overriding server properties**

Sometimes, you might want to evaluate feature flags using properties that haven't been ingested yet, or were set incorrectly earlier. You can do so by setting properties the flag depends on with these calls.

For example, if the `beta-feature` depends on the `is_authorized` property, and you know the value of the property, you can tell PostHog to use this property, like so:


```python
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', person_properties={'is_authorized': True})
# returns string or None
```

The same holds for groups. If you have a group name `organisation`, you can add properties like so:


```python
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', groups={'organisation': 'google'}, group_properties={'organisation': {'is_authorized': True})
# returns string or None
```

**Getting all flag values**

You can also get all known flag values as well. This is useful when you want to seed a frontend client with initial known flags. Like all methods above, this also takes optional person and group properties, if known.

```python
posthog.get_all_flags('distinct id', groups={}, person_properties={'is_authorized': True}, group_properties={})
# returns dict of flag key and value pairs.
```

#### Local Evaluation

> **Note:** To enable local evaluation of feature flags you must also set a `personal_api_key` when configuring the integration, as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

> **Note:** This feature requires version 2.0 of the library, which in turn requires a minimum PostHog version of 1.38

All feature flag evaluation requires an API request to your PostHog servers to get a response. However, where latency matters, you can evaluate flags locally. This is much faster, and requires two things to work:

1. The library must be initialised with a personal API key
2. You must know all person or group properties the flag depends on.

Then, the flag can be evaluated locally. The method signature looks exactly like above

```python
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', person_properties={'is_authorized': True})
# returns string or None
```

> **Note:** New feature flag definitions are polled every 30 seconds by default, which means there will be up to a 30 second delay between you changing the flag definition, and it reflecting on your servers. You can change this default on the client by setting `posthog.poll_interval = <value in seconds>`.

This works for `get_all_flags` as well. It evaluates all flags locally if possible. If even one flag isn't locally evaluable, it falls back to decide.

```python
posthog.get_all_flags('distinct id', groups={}, person_properties={'is_authorized': True}, group_properties={})
# returns dict of flag key and value pairs.
```

**Restricting evaluation to local only**

Sometimes, performance might matter to you so much that you never want an HTTP request roundtrip delay when computing flags. In this case, you can set the `only_evaluate_locally` parameter to true, which tries to compute flags only with the properties it has. If it fails to compute a flag, it returns `None`, instead of going to PostHog's servers to get the value.

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```python
posthog.capture('[distinct id]', 'some event', groups={'company': '42dlsfj23f'})
```

-   Update properties on a group

```python
posthog.group_identify('company', '42dlsfj23f', {
    'name': 'Awesome Inc.',
    'employees': 11
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

### Sending page views

If you're aiming for a full back-end implementation of PostHog, you can send `pageviews` from your backend

```python
posthog.capture('distinct id', '$pageview', {'$current_url': 'https://example.com'})
```

## Django

For Django, you can do the initialisation of the key in the AppConfig, so that it's available everywhere.

in `yourapp/apps.py`

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig
import posthog

class YourAppConfig(AppConfig):
    def ready(self):
        posthog.api_key = '<ph_project_api_key>'
        posthog.host = '<ph_instance_address>' # You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com

```

Then, anywhere else in your app you can do:

```python
import posthog

def purchase(request):
    # example capture
    posthog.capture(request.user.pk, 'purchase', ...)
```

# Integrations

## Sentry

When using [Sentry in Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/), you can connect to PostHog in order to link Sentry errors to PostHog user profiles.

### Example implementation

See the [`sentry_django_example`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/tree/master/sentry_django_example) project for a complete example.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration
from posthog.sentry.posthog_integration import PostHogIntegration

PostHogIntegration.organization = "orgname"

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration(), PostHogIntegration()],
)

# Also set `posthog_distinct_id` tag
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_tag('posthog_distinct_id', 'some distinct id')
```

### Example implementation with Django

This can be made automatic in Django, by adding the following middleware and settings to `settings.py`:

```python

MIDDLEWARE = [
    "posthog.sentry.django.PosthogDistinctIdMiddleware"
]

POSTHOG_DJANGO = {
    "distinct_id": lambda request: request.user and request.user.distinct_id
}
```

## Alternative name

As our open source project [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) shares the same module name, we created a special `posthoganalytics` package, mostly for internal use to avoid module collision. It is the exact same.

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-python` package.

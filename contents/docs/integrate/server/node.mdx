If you're working with Node.js, the official `posthog-node` library is the simple way to integrate your software with PostHog. This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance. And in addition to event capture, [feature flags](https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) are supported as well.

## Installation

Run either `npm` or `yarn` in terminal to add it to your project:

```bash
npm install posthog-node --save
# or
yarn add posthog-node
```

In your app, set your API key **before** making any calls.

```node
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

const client = new PostHog(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    { host: '<ph_instance_address>' } // You can omit this line if using PostHog Cloud
)

// On program exit, call shutdown to stop pending pollers and flush any remaining events
await client.shutdownAsync()
```

You can find your key in the 'Project Settings' page in PostHog.

> **Note:** As a rule of thumb, we do not recommend hardcoding API keys. Setting it as an environment variable would be best.

| `maxCacheSize` | Maximum size of cache that deduplicates $feature_flag_called calls per user.       |          `50000`          |

> **Note:** When using PostHog in an AWS Lambda function or a similar serverless function environment, make sure you set `flushAt` to `1` and `flushInterval` to `0`.

## Making calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

-   `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
-   `event name` to identify the event

*   We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

-   `properties`, which is an object with any information you'd like to add
-   `sendFeatureFlags`, a boolean that determines whether to send current known feature flags with this event. This is useful when running experiments which depends on this event. However, this makes things slow. [Read this tutorial for manually computing this information and speeding things up](/tutorials/experiments#step-2-sending-the-right-events)


For example:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'movie played',
    properties: {
        movieId: '123',
        category: 'romcom',
    },
})
```

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'movie played',
    properties: {
        $set: { userProperty: 'value' },
    },
})
```

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'movie played',
    properties: {
        $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' },
    },
})
```

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things
like segment users by these properties.

An `identify` call requires:

-   `distinctId` – a distinct ID belonging to the user
-   `properties` – a user properties object

For example:

```node
client.identify({
    distinctId: 'user:123',
    properties: {
        email: 'john@doe.com',
        proUser: false,
    },
})
```

The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their information.

### Alias

To connect whatever a user does before they sign up or log in with what they do after you need to make an alias call. This will allow you to answer questions like "Which marketing channels leads to users churning after a month?" or "What do users do on our website before signing up?"

In a purely back-end implementation, this means whenever an anonymous user does something, you'll want to send a session ID with the capture call. Then, when that users signs up, you want to do an alias call with the session ID and the newly created user ID.

The same concept applies for when a user logs in.

If you're using PostHog in the front-end and back-end, doing the `identify` call in the frontend will be enough.

An `alias` call requires:

-   `distinctId` – the user id
-   `alias` – the anonymous session distinct ID

For example:

```node
client.alias({
    distinctId: 'user:123',
    alias: 'session:12345',
})
```

### Sending page views

If you're aiming for a full back-end implementation of PostHog, you can send `pageviews` from your backend, like so:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: '$pageview',
    properties: {
        $current_url: 'https://example.com',
    },
})
```


### Feature flags

PostHog's [feature flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) enable you to safely deploy and roll back new features.

When using them with one of libraries, you should check if a feature flag is enabled and use the result to toggle functionality on and off in you application.

**How to check if a flag is enabled**

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `undefined`, instead of `true`, `false`, or a string variant value.


```node
// isFeatureEnabled(key: string, distinctId: string, options: {}): Promise<boolean | undefined>
const isMyFlagEnabledForUser = await client.isFeatureEnabled('flag-key', 'user distinct id')

if (isMyFlagEnabledForUser) {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

**Get a flag value**

If you're using multivariate feature flags, you can also get the value of the flag, as well as whether or not it is enabled. 

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `None`, instead of `true` or `false` or a string variant value.


```node
// getFeatureFlag(key: string, distinctId: string, options: {}): Promise<string | boolean | undefined>
const flagValue = await client.getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'user distinct id')
```

**Get a flag payload**

Posthog Node v2.3.0 introduces feature flag payloads. Feature flags can be returned with matching payloads which are JSONType (string, number, boolean, dictionary, array) values. 
This allows for custom configurations based on values defined in the posthog app. 

> **Note:** `getFeatureFlag` does not need to be called prior to `getFeatureFlagPayload`. `getFeatureFlagPayload` will implicitly perform 
getFeatureFlag to determine the matching flag and return the corresponding payload.

```node
// getFeatureFlagPayload(key: string, distinctId: string, matchValue?: string | boolean, options: {}): Promise<JsonType | undefined>
const flagPayload = await client.getFeatureFlagPayload('flag-key', 'user distinct id')
```

**Overriding server properties**

Sometimes, you might want to evaluate feature flags using properties that haven't been ingested yet, or were set incorrectly earlier. You can do so by setting properties the flag depends on with these calls.

For example, if the `beta-feature` depends on the `is_authorized` property, and you know the value of the property, you can tell PostHog to use this property, like so:


```node
// getFeatureFlag(
//    key: string,
//    distinctId: string,
//    options?: {
//      groups?: Record<string, string>
//      personProperties?: Record<string, string>
//      groupProperties?: Record<string, Record<string, string>>
//      onlyEvaluateLocally?: boolean
//      sendFeatureFlagEvents?: boolean
//    }
//  ): Promise<string | boolean | undefined>
const flagValue = await client.getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'user distinct id', {personProperties: {is_authorized: true}})
```

The same holds for [groups](/manual/group-analytics). If you have a group named `organisation`, you can add properties like so:


```node
const flagValue = await client.getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'user distinct id', {groups:{'organisation': 'google'}, groupProperties:{'organisation': {'is_authorized': True}})
```

**Getting all flag values**

You can also get all known flag values as well. This is useful when you want to seed a frontend client with initial known flags. Like all methods above, this also takes optional person and group properties, if known.

```node
await client.getAllFlags('distinct id', {groups: {}, personProperties: {'is_authorized': True}, groupProperties: {}})
// returns dict of flag key and value pairs.
```

#### Local Evaluation

> **Note:** To enable local evaluation of feature flags you must also set a `personal_api_key` when configuring the integration, as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

> **Note:** This feature requires version 2.0 of the library, which in turn requires a minimum PostHog version of 1.38

All feature flag evaluation requires an API request to your PostHog servers to get a response. However, where latency matters, you can evaluate flags locally. This is much faster, and requires two things to work:

1. The library must be initialised with a personal API key
2. You must know all person or group properties the flag depends on.

Then, the flag can be evaluated locally. The method signature looks exactly like above.

```node
await client.getFeatureFlag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', {personProperties: {'is_authorized': True}})
// returns string or None
```

> **Note:** New feature flag definitions are polled every 30 seconds by default, which means there will be up to a 30 second delay between you changing the flag definition, and it reflecting on your servers. You can change this default on the client by setting `featureFlagsPollingInterval` during client initialisation.

This works for `getAllFlags` as well. It evaluates all flags locally if possible. If even one flag isn't locally evaluable, it falls back to decide.

```node
await client.getAllFlags('distinct id', {groups: {}, personProperties: {'is_authorized': True}, groupProperties: {}})
// returns dict of flag key and value pairs. 
```

**Restricting evaluation to local only**

Sometimes, performance might matter to you so much that you never want an HTTP request roundtrip delay when computing flags. In this case, you can set the `only_evaluate_locally` parameter to true, which tries to compute flags only with the properties it has. If it fails to compute a flag, it returns `None`, instead of going to PostHog's servers to get the value.

#### Reloading feature flags

When initializing PostHog, you can configure the interval at which feature flags are polled (fetched from the server). However, if you need to force a reload, you can use `reloadFeatureFlags`:

```node
await client.reloadFeatureFlags()

// Do something with feature flags here
```

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```node
client.capture({
    event: 'some event',
    distinctId: '[distinct id]',
    groups: { company: '42dlsfj23f' },
})
```

-   Update properties on a group

```node
client.groupIdentify({
    groupType: 'company',
    groupKey: '42dlsfj23f',
    properties: {
        name: 'Awesome Inc',
        employees: 11,
    },
})
```

### Shutdown

You should call `shutdown` on your program's exit to exit cleanly:

```node
// Stop pending pollers and flush any remaining events
client.shutdown()
// or 
await client.shutdownAsync()
```

## Using in a short-lived process like AWS Lambda

PostHogs's client SDKs are all designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimise API calls and network time. For lambda environments (or also when shutting down a standard Node.js app) we provide a method .shutdownAsync which can be awaited and ensures the queued events are all flushed to the API.

For example:

```node
export const handler() {
  posthog.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'thing happened'
  })

  posthog.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'other thing happened'
  })

  // So far 2 events are queued but not sent

  // Calling shutdown, flushed the queue but batched into 1 API call for maximum efficiency
  await posthog.shutdownAsync() 
}
```


## Upgrading from V1 to V2

V2.x.x of the Node.js library is completely rewritten in Typescript and is based on a new JS core shared with other JavaScript based libraries with the goal of ensuring new features and fixes reach the different libraries at the same pace.

With the release of V2, the API was kept mostly the same but with some small changes and deprecations:

1. The minimum PostHog version requirement is 1.38
2. The `callback` parameter passed as an optional last argument to most of the methods is no longer supported
2. The method signature for `isFeatureEnabled` and `getFeatureFlag` is slightly modified. See the above documentation for each method for more details.
3. For specific changes, [see the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/blob/master/posthog-node/CHANGELOG.md)

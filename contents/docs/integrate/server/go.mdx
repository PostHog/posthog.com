This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance.

## Installation

```go
go get github.com/posthog/posthog-go
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "github.com/posthog/posthog-go"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := posthog.NewWithConfig(
		os.Getenv("POSTHOG_API_KEY"),
		posthog.Config{
			Endpoint:       "<ph_instance_address>",
			PersonalApiKey: "your personal API key", // needed for feature flags
		},
	)
	defer client.Close()

	// run commands
}

```

## Making calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve, or find out where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

-   `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
-   `event name` to specify the event
    -   We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

-   `properties`, which can be an array with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "test-user",
  Event:      "test-snippet",
  Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
    Set("plan", "Enterprise").
    Set("friends", 42),
})
```

#### Setting user properties via an event

To set properties on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `$set` and `$set_once`.

##### $set

**Example**

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "test-user",
  Event:      "test-snippet",
  Properties: map[string]interface{}{
		"eventProp":    "value1",
		"$set": map[string]interface{}{
			"userProp": "value2",
		},
	}
})
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "test-user",
  Event:      "test-snippet",
  Properties: map[string]interface{}{
		"eventProp":    "value1",
		"$set_once": map[string]interface{}{
			"userProp": "value2",
		},
	}
})
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things
like segment users by these properties.

An identify call requires:

-   `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
-   `properties` with a dictionary of any key:value pairs you'd like to add

For example:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Identify{
  DistinctId: "user:123",
  Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
    Set("email", "john@doe.com").
    Set("proUser", false),
})
```

The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their information.

### Alias

To connect whatever a user does before they sign up or login with what they do after, you need to make an alias call. This will allow you to answer questions like "Which marketing channels lead to users churning after a month?" or "What do users do on our website before signing up?"

In a purely back-end implementation, this means whenever an anonymous user does something, you'll want to send a session ID with the capture call. Then, when that users signs up, you want to do an alias call with the session ID and the newly created user ID.

The same concept applies for when a user logs in.

If you're using PostHog in the front-end and back-end, doing the identify call in the frontend will be enough.

An alias call requires

-   `distinct id` the current unique id
-   `alias` the unique ID of the user before

For example:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Alias{
  DistinctId: "user:123",
  Alias: "user:12345",
})
```

### Sending page views

If you're aiming for a full back-end implementation of PostHog, you can send page views from your backend, like so:

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
  DistinctId: "test-user",
  Event:      "$pageview",
  Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
    Set("$current_url", "https://example.com"),
})
```

### Feature flags

> Note that to use feature flags you must specify `PersonalApiKey` in the [options passed to `posthog.NewWithConfig`](#usage).

#### Checking if a feature is enabled

To check if a feature flag is on for a given user, you can call `isFeatureEnabled`, passing the flag's key and the user's distinct ID. You can optionally pass a third argument to override the default result to be returned if the flag is not found. This is set to `false` by default.

```go
// IsFeatureEnabled(FeatureFlagPayload) (interface{}, error)
isFlagEnabledForUser, err := client.IsFeatureEnabled(
		FeatureFlagPayload{
			Key:        "flag-key",
			DistinctId: "distinct-id",
		},
	)

if (isFlagEnabledForUser) {
  // Do something differently for this user
}
```

> If your feature flag relies entirely on rollout percentage (i.e. it has no filters), `isFeatureEnabled` will provide a fast response, allowing it to be used in the logic for API endpoints, for example. Flags that depend on filters require a call to the PostHog API so will take longer.

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `nil`, instead of `true` or `false` or a string variant value.

#### Get a flag value

If you're using multivariate flags, you can get what value the flag is enabled to.

```go
// GetFeatureFlag(FeatureFlagPayload) (interface{}, error)
enabledVariant, err := client.GetFeatureFlag(
		FeatureFlagPayload{
			Key:        "multivariate-flag",
			DistinctId: "distinct-id",
		},
)
```

#### Overriding server properties

Sometimes, you might want to evaluate feature flags using properties that haven't been ingested yet, or were set incorrectly earlier. You can do so by setting properties the flag depends on with these calls.

For example, if the `beta-feature` depends on the `is_authorized` property and you know the value of the property, you can tell PostHog to use this property, like so:

```go
enabledVariant, err := client.GetFeatureFlag(
		FeatureFlagPayload{
			Key:        "multivariate-flag",
			DistinctId: "distinct-id",
      PersonProperties: posthog.NewProperties().
        Set("is_authorized", true),
		},
)
```

The same holds for groups. if you have a group name `organisation`, you can add properties like so:

```go
enabledVariant, err := client.GetFeatureFlag(
		FeatureFlagPayload{
			Key:        "multivariate-flag",
			DistinctId: "distinct-id",
      Groups:          Groups{"organisation": "some-company"},
			GroupProperties: map[string]Properties{"organisation": NewProperties().Set("is_authorized", true)},
		},
)
```

#### Getting all flag values

You can also get all known flag values as well. This is useful when you want to seed a frontend client with initial known flags. Like all methods above, this also takes optional person and group properties, if known.

```go
featureVariants, _ := client.GetAllFlags(FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey{
		DistinctId: "distinct-id",
})
```

#### Local Evaluation

> **Note:** This feature requires version 2.0 of the library, which in turn requires a minimum PostHog version of 1.38

All feature flag evaluation requires an API request to your PostHog servers to get a response. However, where latency matters, you can evaluate flags locally. You must know all person or group properties the flag depends on.

The method call looks just like above


```go
enabledVariant, err := client.GetFeatureFlag(
		FeatureFlagPayload{
			Key:        "multivariate-flag",
			DistinctId: "distinct-id",
      PersonProperties: posthog.NewProperties().
        Set("is_authorized", true),
		},
)
```

#### Restricting evaluation to local only

Sometimes, performance might matter to you so much that you never want an HTTP request roundtrip delay when computing flags. In this case, you can set the OnlyEvaluateLocally parameter to true, which tries to compute flags only with the properties it has. If it fails to compute a flag, it returns None, instead of going to PostHog's servers to get the value.


#### Reloading feature flags

When initializing PostHog, you can configure the interval at which feature flags are polled (fetched from the server). However, if you need to force a reload, you can use `ReloadFeatureFlags`:

```go
client.ReloadFeatureFlags()

// Do something with feature flags here
```

### Group analytics

PostHog 1.31.0 introduced support for [group analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics), which allows you to associate users and events with larger groups (teams, organizations, etc.). This feature requires the latest version of posthog-go

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "[distinct id]",
    Event:      "some event",
    Groups: posthog.NewGroups().
        Set("company", "id:5").
})

```

-   Update properties on a group

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.GroupIdentify{
    Type: "company",
    Key:  "id:5",
    Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
        Set("company_name", "Awesome Inc").
        Set("employees", 11),
})
```

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-go` package.

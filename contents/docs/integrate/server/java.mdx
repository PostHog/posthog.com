<VisitLibrary name="Java" to="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-java" official />

This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Java. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation 

The best way to install the PostHog Android library is with a build system like 
Gradle or Maven. This ensures you can easily upgrade to the latest versions. 

Lookup the latest version in [com.posthog.java](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.posthog.java/posthog). 

### Gradle
All you need to do is add the `posthog` module to your `build.gradle`:

```bash
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.posthog.java:posthog:+'
}
```

### Maven
All you need to do is add the `posthog` module to your `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.posthog.java</groupId>
  <artifactId>posthog</artifactId>
  <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

### Other

See the [com.posthog.java](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.posthog.java/posthog) in the Maven Central Repository. Clicking on the latest version shows you options for adding dependencies for other build systems.

## Usage

```java
import com.posthog.java.PostHog;

class Sample {
  private static final String POSTHOG_API_KEY = "<ph_project_api_key>";
  private static final String POSTHOG_HOST = "<ph_instance_address>";

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    PostHog posthog = PostHog.builder(POSTHOG_API_KEY).host(POSTHOG_HOST).build();

    // run commands

    posthog.shutdown();  // send the last events in queue
  }
}
```

## Making calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:
 - `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
 - `event name` to specify the event
  * We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:
- `properties`, which is a dictionary with any information you'd like to add

For example:
```java
posthog.capture("distinct id", "movie played", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("movie_id", 123);
    put("category", "romcom");
  }
});
```

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things 
like segment users by these properties.

An `identify` call requires:
- `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
- `properties` with a dict with any key:value pairs 

For example:
```java
posthog.identify("distinct id", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("email", "john@doe.com);
    put("proUser", false);
  }
});
```

The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their information.

### Alias

To connect whatever a user does before they sign up or login with what they do after, you need to make an alias call. This will allow you to answer questions like "Which marketing channels lead to users churning after a month?" or "What do users do on our website before signing up?"

In a purely back-end implementation, this means whenever an anonymous user does something, you'll want to send a session ID with the capture call. Then, when that users signs up, you want to do an alias call with the session ID and the newly created user ID.

The same concept applies for when a user logs in.

If you're using PostHog in the front-end and back-end, doing the `identify` call in the frontend will be enough.

An `alias` call requires:
- `previous distinct id` the unique ID of the user before
- `distinct id` the current unique id

For example:
```java
posthog.alias("anonymous session id", "distinct id");
```

### Setting user properties

Note: `set_once` works just like `set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

There are three options:

#### With the `capture` call

```java
posthog.capture("distinct id", "movie played", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("eventProperty", "value1");                    // event properties
    put("$set",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {       // user properties
      {
        put("email", "john@doe.com);
        put("proUser", false);
      }
    });
    put("$set_once",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {  // user properties
      {
        put("user_first_location", "colorado");
      }
    });
  }
});
```

#### With the `identify` call

```java
posthog.identify("distinct id", new HashMap<String, Object>() {  // set
    {
      put("email", "john@doe.com);
      put("proUser", false);
    }
  }, new HashMap<String, Object>() {                             // set_once
    {
      put("user_first_location", "colorado");
    }
});
```

#### With `set` or `set_once` calls

```java
posthog.set("distinct id", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("email", "john@doe.com);
    put("proUser", false);
  }
});
```

```java
posthog.setOnce("distinct id", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("user_first_location", "colorado");
  }
});
```

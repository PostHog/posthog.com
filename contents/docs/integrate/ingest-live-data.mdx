Live data ingestion, opposed to [historical data ingestions](/docs/integrate/ingest-historical-data), is the process of sending events from your applications to PostHog in real-time; as they happen.

Live (real-time) events can be integrated using [client libraries](/docs/integrate/overview#client-libraries), [server libraries](/docs/integrate/overview#server-libraries), and [third-party platform integrations](/docs/integrate/overview#integrations).

The purpose of this guide is to help you understand some key concepts with a goal of ingesting live data into PostHog. For the purposes of the guide we'll focus on the client libraries as a means for data ingestion.

The guide covers the following:

- [Installing and initializing a PostHog library](#installing-a-library)
- [How to identify and associate users with events](#identifying-users)
- [How to send events to PostHog](#sending-events)
- [How Autocapture works in PostHog](#how-autocapture-works) (JavaScript only)

If you prefer to learn by doing, you can get started on the web with the [JavaScript snippet](/docs/integrate/client/snippet-installation).

# Installing a Library

Install the library for the platform you are building your application for.

import JSInstall from './client/js/snippets/install.mdx'

<Tabs defaultActiveKey="1" type="card" size="large" style={{marginBottom: "20px"}}>
    <TabPane tab="JavaScript" key="1">
        <JSInstall />
    </TabPane>
    <TabPane tab="Android" key="2">
    </TabPane>
    <TabPane tab="iOS" key="3">

    <TabPane tab="Flutter" key="4">

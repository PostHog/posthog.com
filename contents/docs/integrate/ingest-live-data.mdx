Live data ingestion, opposed to [historical data ingestions](/docs/integrate/ingest-historic-data), is the process of sending events from your applications to PostHog in real-time; as they happen.

Live (real-time) events can be integrated using [client libraries](/docs/integrate/overview#client-libraries), [server libraries](/docs/integrate/overview#server-libraries), and [third-party platform integrations](/docs/integrate/overview#integrations).

The purpose of this guide is to help you understand some key concepts with a goal of ingesting live data into PostHog. For the purposes of the guide we'll focus on the client libraries as a means for data ingestion.

The guide covers the following:

-   [Installing and initializing a PostHog library](#install-a-library)
-   [How autocapture works with the JavaScript library](#autocapture)
-   [How to capture user events with PostHog](#capture-user-events)
-   [How to identify and associate users with events](#identify-users)

If you prefer to learn by doing, you can get started on the web with the [JavaScript snippet](/docs/integrate/client/snippet-installation).

# Install a library

Install the library for the platform you are building your application for.

> Autocapture is presently only available in the web browser using the JavaScript library. For non-browser platforms and for situations where you wish to manually capture events, see the [capture user events](#capture-user-events) section.

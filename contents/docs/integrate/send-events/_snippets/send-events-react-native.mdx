## Autocapture 

PostHog autocapture automatically tracks the following events for you:

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state
-   **Application Became Active** - when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using `@react-navigation/native` or `react-native-navigation`)
-   **$autocapture** - touch events when the user interacts with the screen

With autocapture, all touch events for children of `PosthogProvider` are tracked, capturing a snapshot of the view hierarchy at that point. This enables you to create [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) in PostHog without having to add custom events.

PostHog will try to generate a sensible name for the touched element based on the React component `displayName` or `name` but you can force this to something reliable (and also clearly marked for PostHog tracking) using the `ph-label` prop.

```react-native
<View ph-label="my-special-label"></View>
```

If there are elements you don't want to be captured, you can add the `ph-no-capture` property like so. If this property is found anywhere in the view hierarchy, the entire touch event is ignored.

```react-native
<View ph-no-capture>Sensitive view here</View>
```

#### Tracking Screen views and touches with `@react-navigation/native`:

```react-native
// App.(js|ts)

import { PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'

export function App() {
    return (
        <NavigationContainer>
            <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" autocapture>
                {/* Rest of app */}
            </PostHogProvider>
        </NavigationContainer>
    )
}
```

#### Tracking Screen views and touches with `react-native-navigation`:

```react-native
import PostHog, { PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
import { Navigation } from 'react-native-navigation';

export const posthogAsync = PostHog.initAsync('<ph_project_api_key>');

// Simplify the wrapping of your Screens with a shared PostHogProvider
export const SharedPostHogProvider = (props: any) => {
  return (
    <PostHogProvider client={posthogAsync} autocapture={{
      captureLifecycleEvents: false,  // Lifecycle events are handled differently for react-native-navigation
      captureTouches: true,
    }}>
      {props.children}
    </PostHogProvider>
  );
};

export const MyScreen = () => {
  return (
    // Every screen needs to be wrapped with this provider if you want to capture touches or use the hook `usePostHog()` 
    <SharedPostHogProvider>
      <View>
        ...
      </View>
    </SharedPostHogProvider>
  );
};

Navigation.registerComponent('Screen', () => MyScreen);

Navigation.events().registerAppLaunchedListener(async () => {
  (await posthogAsync).initReactNativeNavigation({
    navigation: {
      // (Optional) Set the name based on the route. Defaults to the route name.
      routeToName: (name, properties) => name,
      // (Optional) Tracks all passProps as properties. Defaults to undefined
      routeToProperties: (name, properties) => properties,
    },
  });
});
```

### Autocapture configuration

You can tweak how autocapture works by passing custom options.

```react-native
<PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" autocapture={{
    captureTouches: true, // If you don't want to capture touch events set this to false
    captureLifecycleEvents: true, // If you don't want to capture the Lifecycle Events (e.g. Application Opened) set this to false
    captureScreens: true, // If you don't want to capture screen events set this to false
    ignoreLabels: [], // Any labels here will be ignored from the stack in touch events
    customLabelProp: "ph-label",
    noCaptureProp: "ph-no-capture",
    propsToCapture = ["testID"], // Limit which props are captured. By default, identifiers and text content are captured.

    navigation: {
        // By default only the Screen name is tracked but it is possible to track the
        // params or modify the name by intercepting theautocapture like so
        routeToName: (name, params) => {
            if (params.id) return `${name}/${params.id}`
            return name
        },
        routeToParams: (name, params) => {
            if (name === "SensitiveScreen") return undefined
            return params
        },
    }
}}>
    ...
</PostHogProvider>
```

### Capturing screen views

With the `PostHogProvider`, screen tracking is automatically captured if the `autocapture` property is used. Currently only [@react-navigation/native](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) is supported by autocapture and it is important that the `PostHogProvider` is configured as a child of the `NavigationContainer`.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function. This function requires a `name`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```javascript
posthog.screen('dashboard', {
    background: 'blue',
    hero: 'superhog',
})
```

### Autocapture 

PostHog autocapture automatically tracks the following events for you:

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state or when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Deep Link Opened** - when the app is opened from a deep link.
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **Application Installed** - when the app is installed.
-   **Application Updated** - when the app is updated.
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using `UIViewController`)

### Capturing screen views

With [`configuration.captureScreenViews`](/docs/libraries/ios#all-configuration-options) set as `true`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.screen("Dashboard", properties: ["fromIcon": "bottom"])
```

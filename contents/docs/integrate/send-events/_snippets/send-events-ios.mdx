### Autocapture 

PostHog autocapture automatically tracks the following events for you:

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state or when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **Application Installed** - when the app is installed.
-   **Application Updated** - when the app is updated.
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using `UIViewController`)

### Capturing screen views

With [`configuration.captureScreenViews`](/docs/libraries/ios#all-configuration-options) set as `true`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.screen("Dashboard", properties: ["fromIcon": "bottom"])
```

### Capturing screen views in SwiftUI

In SwiftUI, views can exist at multiple levels of abstraction, making automatic tracking challenging. A SwiftUI view might represent an entire screen, similar to a `UIViewController`, but it could also represent much smaller UI components, like `UIControl` or `UIView` elements. Because SwiftUI doesn’t clearly distinguish between these levels of views in the same way UIKit does, it becomes difficult to reliably auto-track "screen" (as in full-screen) views.

Moreover, because of SwiftUI's declarative nature and dynamic view construction, SwiftUI views may sometimes lack clear, static names that are suitable for analytics purposes. 

To track a screen view, you can explicitly apply the `postHogScreenView` view modifier to your full-screen view. While the PostHog iOS SDK will attempt to infer the screen's name based on the view's `Type`, you can also pass a custom screen name that better describes your view, along with optional event properties.

```swift 
// This will trigger a screen view event with $screen_name: "HomeView"
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome to MyCoolView")
            .postHogScreenView()
    }
}

// This will trigger a screen view event with $screen_name: "My Home View" and an additional event property `from_button: "start"`
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome to MyCoolView")
            .postHogScreenView("My Home View", ["from_button": "start"])
    }
}
```

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] capture:@"user signed up" 
    properties:@{ @"login_type": @"email", 
                  @"$is_free_trial": @YES }
];
```

```swift
posthog.capture(
    "user signed up", 
    properties: ["login_type": "email", "$set": ["is_free_trial": true] 
])
```

### Capturing screen views

With [`configuration.recordScreenViews`](/ios#all-configuration-options) set as `YES`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

```objectivec
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] screen:@"Dashboard" properties:@{ @"fromIcon": @"bottom" }];
```

```swift
posthog.screen("Dashboard", properties: ["fromIcon": "bottom"])
```

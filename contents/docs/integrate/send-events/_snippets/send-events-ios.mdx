### Autocapture 

PostHog autocapture automatically tracks the following events for you:

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state or when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **Application Installed** - when the app is installed.
-   **Application Updated** - when the app is updated.
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using `UIViewController`)

### Capturing screen views

With [`configuration.captureScreenViews`](/docs/libraries/ios#all-configuration-options) set as `true`, PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.screen("Dashboard", properties: ["fromIcon": "bottom"])
```

> **Important:** Please note that `captureScreenViews` configuration is intented for `UIKit` use. For `SwiftUI` screen captures, please see the following section.

### Capturing screen views in SwiftUI

To track a screen view in `SwiftUI`, apply the `postHogScreenView` modifier to your full-screen views. The PostHog iOS SDK will infer a screen name based on the view’s type, but you can provide a custom name and event properties if needed.

```swift 
// This will trigger a screen view event with $screen_name: "HomeViewContent"
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HomeViewContent()
            .postHogScreenView()
    }
}

// This will trigger a screen view event with $screen_name: "My Home View" and an additional event property from_button: "start"
struct HomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HomeViewContent()
            .postHogScreenView("My Home View", ["from_button": "start"])
    }
}
```

In SwiftUI, views can range from entire screens to small UI components. Unlike UIKit, SwiftUI doesn’t clearly distinguish between these levels, which makes automatic tracking of full-screen views harder.

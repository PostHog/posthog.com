### Batching events

Events can be sent together in a batch. There is no limit on the number of events you can send in a batch, but the entire request body must be less than `20MB` by default.

```shell label=Batch
POST https://[your-instance].com/batch/
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "batch": [
        {
            "event": "event_name",
            "properties": {
                "distinct_id": "distinct_id_of_the_user",
                "key1": "value1",
                "key2": "value2"
            },
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

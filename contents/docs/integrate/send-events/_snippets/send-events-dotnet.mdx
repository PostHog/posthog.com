### Sending page views

If you're aiming for a backend-only implementation of PostHog and won't be capturing events from your frontend, you can send `pageviews` from your backend like so:

```csharp
using PostHog;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Extensions;

posthog.CapturePageView("distinct_id_of_the_user", context.HttpContext.Request.GetDisplayUrl());
```

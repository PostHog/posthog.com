By default, PostHog automatically captures pageviews and pageleaves as well as clicks, change of inputs, and form submissions associated with `a`, `button`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, and `label` tags. See our [autocapture docs](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) for more details on this.

If you prefer to disable or filter these, set the appropriate values in your [configuration options](/docs/libraries/js/config).

### Custom event capture

<CustomEventIntro />

```js-web
posthog.capture('user_signed_up');
```

<NamingTip />

<SettingProperties />

```js-web
posthog.capture('user_signed_up', {
    login_type: "email",
    is_free_trial: true
})
```

### Manually capturing pageviews and pageleaves in single-page apps

PostHog automatically captures `$pageview` events on page load and `$pageleave` events on page unload. If you have a single-page app, that means it only sends pageview and pageleave once (when your app loads and when users leave).

To make sure any navigating a user does within your app gets captured, you can make pageview and pageleave calls manually like this:

```js-web
// Capture pageview
posthog.capture('$pageview')

// Capture pageleave
posthog.capture('$pageleave')
```

This automatically sends the current URL along with other [autocaptured properties](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#autocaptured-properties) like the referrer, OS, scroll depth, and more. See our guide to [tracking pageviews in single-page apps](/tutorials/single-page-app-pageviews) for more details.

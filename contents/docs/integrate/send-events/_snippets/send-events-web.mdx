### Page views and autocapture 

By default, PostHog automatically captures the following frontend events:

- **Pageviews**, including the URL.
- [**Autocaptured events**](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), such as any `click`, `change of input`, or submission associated with `a`, `button`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, and `label` tags.

If you prefer to disable these, set the appropriate values in your [configuration options](/docs/libraries/js#config).

### Manually capturing pageviews and pageleaves in single-page apps

PostHog automatically sends `$pageview` events whenever it gets loaded and `$pageleave` when they leaves. If you have a single-page app, that means it only sends pageview and pageleave once (when your app loads and when they leave).

To make sure any navigating a user does within your app gets captured, you can make pageview and pageleave calls manually.

```js-web
// Capture pageview
posthog.capture('$pageview')

// Capture pageleave
posthog.capture('$pageleave')
```

This automatically sends the current URL along with other [autocaptured properties](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#autocaptured-properties) like the referrer, OS, scroll depth, and more.

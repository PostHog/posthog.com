### Page views and autocapture 

By default, PostHog automatically captures the following frontend events:

- **Pageviews**, including the URL.
- [**Autocaptured events**](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), such as any `click`, `change of input`, or submission associated with `a`, `button`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, and `label` tags.

If you prefer to disable these, set the appropriate values in your [configuration options](/docs/libraries/js#config).

### Single-page apps and pageviews

PostHog automatically sends `pageview` events whenever it gets loaded. If you have a single-page app, that means it only sends a pageview once (when your app loads).

To make sure any navigating a user does within your app gets captured, you can make a pageview call manually.

```js-web
posthog.capture('$pageview')
```

This automatically sends the current URL along with other relevant properties.

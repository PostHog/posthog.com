```python
# Events captured with no context or explicit distinct_id are marked as personless and have an auto-generated distinct_id:
posthog.capture('some-anon-event')

from posthog import identify_context, new_context

# Use contexts to manage user identification across multiple capture calls
with new_context():
    identify_context('distinct_id_of_the_user')
    posthog.capture('user_signed_up')
    posthog.capture('user_logged_in')
    # You can also capture events with a specific distinct_id
    posthog.capture('some-custom-action', distinct_id='distinct_id_of_the_user')

```

```python
posthog.capture(
    "user_signed_up",
    distinct_id="distinct_id_of_the_user",
    properties={
        "login_type": "email",
        "is_free_trial": "true"
    }
)
```

### Sending page views

If you're aiming for a backend-only implementation of PostHog and won't be capturing events from your frontend, you can send `pageviews` from your backend like so:

```python
posthog.capture('$pageview', distinct_id="distinct_id_of_the_user", properties={'$current_url': 'https://example.com'})
```

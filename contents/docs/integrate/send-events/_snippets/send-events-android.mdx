PostHog.capture(
    event = "user_signed_up",
    properties = mapOf(
        "login_type" to "email",
        "is_free_trial" to true
    )
)
```

### Autocapture 

PostHog autocapture automatically tracks the following events for you:

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state or when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Deep Link Opened** - when the app is opened from a deep link.
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **Application Installed** - when the app is installed.
-   **Application Updated** - when the app is updated.
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using `android.app.Activity`)

### Capturing screen views

With [`captureScreenViews = true`](/docs/libraries/android#all-configuration-options), PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

This function requires a `screenTitle`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```kotlin
import com.posthog.PostHog

PostHog.screen(
    screenTitle = "Dashboard",
    properties = mapOf(
        "background" to "blue",
        "hero" to "superhog"
    )
)
```

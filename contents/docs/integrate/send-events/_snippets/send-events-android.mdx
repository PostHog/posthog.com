```kotlin
PostHog.capture(
    event = "user_signed_up",
    properties = mapOf(
        "login_type" to "email",
        "is_free_trial" to true
    )
)
```

### Capturing screen views

With [`captureScreenViews = true`](/docs/libraries/android#all-configuration-options), PostHog will try to record all screen changes automatically.

If you want to manually send a new screen capture event, use the `screen` function.

This function requires a `screenTitle`. You may also pass in an optional `properties` object.

```kotlin
PostHog.screen(
    screenTitle = "Dashboard",
    properties = mapOf(
        "background" to "blue",
        "hero" to "superhog"
    )
)
```

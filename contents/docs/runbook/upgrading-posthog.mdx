We want to make sure upgrading PostHog is as smooth as possible.
We use a synchronous and an asynchronous migration framework to make sure database migrations are easy to be deployed, rolled back and safe to run.

Because some data migrations require touching tables that can get very large for some PostHog installation, some migrations are a little more involved.

For more information on any extra steps needed when updating to specific versions, check out our [upgrade notes](/docs/runbook/upgrade-notes).

If you need help, feel free to [join our community Slack](/slack) for further assistance.

## 1. Get and update the Helm repo

To upgrade the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) release `posthog` in the `posthog` namespace:

  <CommandHelmGetRepoSnippet />

## 2. Follow the upgrade notes

```shell
helm list -n posthog
helm search repo posthog
```

Take note of the numbers of the **Helm chart version** (in the format `posthog-{major}.{minor}.{patch}` - for example, `posthog-19.15.1`) when running the commands above.

Make sure to check the [upgrade notes](/docs/runbook/upgrade-notes) for the new version, along with all the prior versions before moving forward\*\*.

## 3. Run the upgrade

  <CommandHelmUpgradeSnippet />

Check the Helm [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for more info about the `helm upgrade` command.

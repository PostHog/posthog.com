[`0002_fill_distinct_id2`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/async_migrations/migrations/0003_fill_person_distinct_id2.py) is an async migration added to migrate the data from the old `person_distinct_id` table to the new `person_distinct_id2` table.

This is needed for faster `person_distinct_id` queries as the old schema worked off of (`distinct_id`, `person_id`) pairs, making it expensive for our analytics queries, which need to map from `distinct_id` to the latest `person_id`. 

The new schema works off of `distinct_id` columns, leveraging `ReplacingMergeTrees` with a version column we store in postgres.

We migrate teams one-by-one to avoid running out of memory.

The migration strategy:
    1. Write any new updates to both tables
    2. Insert all non-deleted (`team_id`, `distinct_id`, `person_id`) rows from `person_distinct_id` into `person_distinct_id2` (this migration)
    3. Once migration has run, we only read/write from/to pdi2.

## FAQ

### Is it dangerous for this migration to be in an errored state?

No, the migration copies data to the new table, but that new table is not used until the migration has successfully completed.

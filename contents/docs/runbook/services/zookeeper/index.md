ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming,
providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

At PostHog we use it to store metadata information for [ClickHouse](./clickhouse)
and [Kafka](./kafka).

## Failure modes

### Disk space usage increases rapidly

It has been observed that Zookeepers can suddenly increase it's disk usage, after
being in a stable state for some time. This can sometimes be resolved by ensuring
that old Zookeeper snapshots are cleared. If you experience this issue you can
validate this solution by running [zkCleanup.sh](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/zookeeper-docs/src/main/resources/markdown/zookeeperTools.md#zkCleanup):

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n posthog posthog-posthog-zookeeper -- df -h /bitnami/zookeeper
kubectl exec -it -n posthog posthog-posthog-zookeeper -- /opt/bitnami/zookeeper/bin/zkCleanup.sh -n 3
kubectl exec -it -n posthog posthog-posthog-zookeeper -- df -h /bitnami/zookeeper
```

This will remove all snapshots aside from the last three, printing out the disk
usage before and after.

In newer versions of our [Helm chart](https://github.com/PostHog/charts-clickhouse) we
run snapshot cleanups periodically every hour. If you experience Zookeeper space issues
and are on chart 18.2.0 or below, you can update to a later version to enable this.
Alternatively you can specify the Helm value `zookeeper.autopurge.purgeInterval=1` which
will cause the clean up job to run every hour.

If you wish to further debug what is being added to your cluster, you can inspect
a snapshot diff by running [zhSnapshotComparer.sh](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/zookeeper-docs/src/main/resources/markdown/zookeeperTools.md#zkSnapshotComparer) e.g.:

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n posthog posthog-posthog-zookeeper -- /opt/bitnami/zookeeper/bin/zkSnapshotComparer.sh -l /bitnami/zookeeper/data/version-2/snapshot.fe376 -r /bitnami/zookeeper/data/version-2/snapshot.ff8c0 -b 2 -n 1
```

This will give you a breakdown of the number of nodes in each snapshot, as well as
the exact node difference between the two. For example:

```bash
Deserialized snapshot in snapshot.fe376 in 0.045252 seconds
Processed data tree in 0.038782 seconds
Deserialized snapshot in snapshot.ff8c0 in 0.018605 seconds

When trying to upgrade a self-hosted Postgres-backed PostHog instance, we have seen some users have issues with long-running migrations on tables in the hot path.

For example, when trying to migrate the persons table, some users have reported that a lock is never acquired, making the migration hang.

This usually happens because some analytics queries are taking too long to complete.

To get rid of these queries and run the migration, you can use the script below on the node where the PostHog Django server (web) is running.

> **⚠️ Warning!** Proceed with caution. The following script has potentially destructive behavior.

<summary><b>Python script</b></summary>

```python
# How to run:
# Add this code to a delete_queries.py file
# Run python manage.py shell < delete_queries.py
# Set DRY_RUN=0 if you're sure you know what you're doing

import os
from time import sleep

from django.db import connection

QUERY_TIME_LIMIT = os.environ.get("QUERY_TIME_LIMIT", "5 minutes")
TARGET_TABLE = os.environ.get("TARGET_TABLE", "posthog_person")
DRY_RUN = os.environ.get("DRY_RUN", "1") == "1"

MAX_TRIES = 10


def fetch_open_queries():
    res = []
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(
            f"""
            SELECT
                pid,
                now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
                query
            FROM pg_stat_activity
            WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '{QUERY_TIME_LIMIT}'
            AND state = 'active'
            """
        )
        res = cursor.fetchall()
    return res


open_queries = fetch_open_queries()
tries = 0

while open_queries and len(open_queries) > 0 and tries < MAX_TRIES:
    for query_details in open_queries:
        if TARGET_TABLE in query_details[2]:
            print(f"Preparing to kill query {query_details[0]}:")
            print(query_details[2])
            print(f"It has been active for {query_details[1].seconds}s")
            if not DRY_RUN:
                with connection.cursor() as cursor:
                    cursor.execute(f"SELECT pg_terminate_backend({query_details[0]})")
                print(f"Killed query {query_details[0]}")
            print("")
    open_queries = fetch_open_queries()
    tries += 1
    sleep(1)
```

Instead of the script, you can also look for long running queries in Postgres yourself, like so:

```sql
SELECT
    pid,
    now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
    query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 minutes'
AND state = 'active'
```

Using the PIDs from the query above, you can then kill them like so:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
```

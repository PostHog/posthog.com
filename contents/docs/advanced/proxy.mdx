A reverse proxy enables you to send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain.

This means setting up a service to redirect requests from a subdomain you choose (like `e.yourdomain.com`) to PostHog.

You then use this subdomain as your `api_host` in the initialization of PostHog instead of `us.i.posthog.com` or `eu.i.posthog.com`.

## Why do we recommend deploying one?

Using a reverse proxy means that events are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers.

You'll be able to capture more usage data without having to self-host PostHog, ensuring you get a complete view of your users.

## Deploying a reverse proxy

Using our [managed reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy/managed-reverse-proxy) is the easiest way to do this.

It's available as part of our [platforms add-ons](/platform-packages), which includes automatic provisioning, SSO and 2FA enforcement, priority support, and additional collaboration features.

Other documented options for deploying a reverse proxy include:

-   [AWS CloudFront](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudfront)
-   [Caddy](/docs/advanced/proxy/caddy)
-   [Cloudflare](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudflare)
-   [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](/docs/advanced/proxy/kubernetes-ingress-controller)
-   [Netlify](/docs/advanced/proxy/netlify)
-   [Next.js rewrites](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs)
-   [Next.js middleware](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs-middleware)
-   [nginx](/docs/advanced/proxy/nginx)
-   [node](/docs/advanced/proxy/node)
-   [Railway](/docs/advanced/proxy/railway)
-   [Remix](/docs/advanced/proxy/remix)
-   [SvelteKit](/docs/advanced/proxy/sveltekit)
-   [Vercel](/docs/advanced/proxy/vercel)
-   [Nuxt](/docs/advanced/proxy/nuxt)
-   [Pomerium](/docs/advanced/proxy/pomerium)

## Best practices

-   We require that the proxy sets the `Host` header to the same host it's calling. Check the guides above on how to do that for several proxies.
-   Don't use a subdomain that includes `posthog`, `analytics`, `tracking`, or other similar words which might cause events to be blocked.
-   Make sure to [pass the proper `ui_host` parameter](/docs/libraries/js/config) when initializing PostHog, so that links to PostHog point to the correct host (like `us.posthog.com`). This is required for tasks like authenticating the toolbar.

## Reverse proxy requirements

If you want to use an alternative reverse proxy that we have not documented, it must meet the following requirements:

```yaml
- route: e.yourdomain.com/static/*
  reverse_proxy: https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/*
  host_header: us-assets.i.posthog.com

- route: e.yourdomain.com/*
  reverse_proxy: https://us.i.posthog.com/*
  host_header: us.i.posthog.com
```

<CalloutBox icon="IconWarning" title="Beware of size limits" type="caution">
    Some systems have size limits (e.g. AWS WAF defaults to 8kb) which can cause problems if they are used as or with a
    reverse proxy. PostHog events can be up to 1MB and session recordings can be up to 64MB per message, so you may need
    to adjust your limits.

## FAQ

### Why doesn't PostHog use its own proxy?

We do use a proxy for our own analytics! However, ad blockers specifically target well-known analytics and tracking domains. When ad blockers visit `posthog.com`, they identify and catalog the tracking scripts and domains we use, then add them to their block lists.

This means that even if we proxy our own tracking through a subdomain like `e.posthog.com`, ad blockers will still block it because they've specifically identified it as a PostHog tracking endpoint.

Your proxy works differently because ad blockers haven't specifically visited your domain to catalog your tracking setup. When you use a domain like `e.yourdomain.com`, it appears to ad blockers as just another part of your application rather than a known tracking service.

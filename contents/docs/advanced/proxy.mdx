A reverse proxy enables you to send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain. 

This means setting up a service to redirect requests from a subdomain you choose (like `e.yourdomain.com`) to PostHog.

You then use this subdomain as your `api_host` in the initialization of PostHog instead of `us.i.posthog.com` or `eu.i.posthog.com`.

## Why do we recommend deploying one?

Using a reverse proxy means that events are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers. 

You'll be able to capture more usage data without having to self-host PostHog, ensuring you get a complete view of your users.

## Deploying a reverse proxy

Using our [managed reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy/managed-reverse-proxy) is the easiest way to do this.

It's available as part of our [Teams add-on](/addons#teams), which includes automatic provisioning, SSO and 2FA enforcement, priority support, and additional collaboration features.

Other documented options for deploying a reverse proxy include:

- [AWS CloudFront](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudfront)
- [Caddy](/docs/advanced/proxy/caddy)
- [Cloudflare](/docs/advanced/proxy/cloudflare)
- [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](/docs/advanced/proxy/kubernetes-ingress-controller)
- [Netlify](/docs/advanced/proxy/netlify)
- [Next.js rewrites](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs)
- [Next.js middleware](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs-middleware)
- [nginx](/docs/advanced/proxy/nginx)
- [Remix](/docs/advanced/proxy/remix)
- [Vercel](/docs/advanced/proxy/vercel)
- [Vite](/docs/advanced/proxy/vite)
- [Nuxt](/docs/advanced/proxy/nuxt)
- [Pomerium](/docs/advanced/proxy/pomerium)

## Best practices

- We require that the proxy sets the `Host` header to the same host it's calling. Check the guides above on how to do that for several proxies.
- Don't use a subdomain that includes `posthog`, `analytics`, `tracking`, or other similar words which might cause events to be blocked.
- Make sure to [pass the proper `ui_host` parameter](/docs/libraries/js/config) when initializing PostHog, so that links to PostHog point to the correct host (like `us.posthog.com`). This is required for tasks like authenticating the toolbar.

## Reverse proxy requirements

If you want to use an alternative reverse proxy that we have not documented, it must meet the following requirements:

```yaml
- route: e.yourdomain.com/static/*
  reverse_proxy: https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/*
  host_header: us-assets.i.posthog.com

- route: e.yourdomain.com/*
  reverse_proxy: https://us.i.posthog.com/*
  host_header: us.i.posthog.com
```

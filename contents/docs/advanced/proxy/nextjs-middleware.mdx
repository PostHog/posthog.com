<RegionWarning />

If you are using Next.js and [rewrites aren't working for you](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs), you can write custom middleware to proxy requests to PostHog. 

To do this using the [app router](/tutorials/nextjs-app-directory-analytics), create a file named `middleware.js` in your base directory (same level as the `app` folder). In this file, set up code to match requests to a custom route, set a new `host` header, change the URL to point to PostHog, and rewrite the response.

```js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
 
export function middleware(request) {
  let url = request.nextUrl.clone()
  const hostname = url.pathname.startsWith("/ingest/static/") ? 'us-assets.i.posthog.com' : 'us.i.posthog.com'
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
  
  requestHeaders.set('host', hostname)

  url.protocol = 'https'
  url.hostname = hostname
  url.port = 443
  url.pathname = url.pathname.replace(/^\/ingest/, '');

  return NextResponse.rewrite(url, {
    headers: requestHeaders,
  })
}
 
export const config = {
  matcher: '/ingest/:path*',
}
```

Once done, configure the PostHog client to send requests via your rewrite.

```js
posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
  api_host: "https://your-host.com/ingest"
  ui_host: "https://app.posthog.com" // or "https://eu.posthog.com" if your PostHog is hosted in Europe
})
```

> **Note:** Next.js proxies are limited to requests from the Next.js application itself. This solution won't work if you are making requests from another application or website due to CORS errors. [We have an open issue with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/63948) to try and resolve this problem. For now, we recommend only making requests from your Next.js application to a Next.js proxy.

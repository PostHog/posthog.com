This guide shows you how to deploy a PostHog reverse proxy on [Railway](https://railway.app/).

## How it works

Railway provides a one-click deployment template that runs an nginx-based reverse proxy. When deployed, Railway gives you a domain that routes all requests to PostHog's servers.

Here's the request flow:

1. User triggers an event in your app
2. Request goes to your Railway domain (e.g., `your-project.up.railway.app`)
3. The nginx proxy running on Railway forwards the request to PostHog
4. PostHog processes the request and returns a response
5. The proxy returns PostHog's response to the user

This works because ad blockers see requests going to Railway's domain (or your custom domain), not PostHog's.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires a [Railway account](https://railway.app/) (free tier works).

## Setup

<Steps>

<Step title="Deploy the template">

Click the button below to deploy a pre-configured PostHog reverse proxy on Railway:

<div className="w-fit">
    <a href="https://railway.app/template/posthog-proxy?referralCode=FQRCYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <img src="https://railway.app/button.svg" alt="Deploy on Railway" className="max-w-[200px] h-auto mb-4" noZoom />
    </a>
</div>

This template deploys an nginx container configured to proxy requests to PostHog.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your region">

During deployment, Railway prompts you to set the `POSTHOG_CLOUD_REGION` environment variable:

- Set to `us` for US region
- Set to `eu` for EU region

This tells the proxy which PostHog servers to forward requests to. Make sure this matches your PostHog project's region.

</Step>

<Step title="Wait for deployment">

Railway automatically builds and deploys your proxy. This usually takes 1-2 minutes.

Once deployed, Railway provides you with a domain like `your-project-name.up.railway.app`. You can find this in your project's **Settings** → **Networking** section.

</Step>

<Step title="Update your PostHog SDK">

In your application code, update your PostHog initialization to use your Railway domain:

<MultiLanguage>

```js file=US
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: 'https://your-project-name.up.railway.app',
  ui_host: 'https://us.posthog.com'
})
```

```js file=EU
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: 'https://your-project-name.up.railway.app',
  ui_host: 'https://eu.posthog.com'
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

Replace `your-project-name.up.railway.app` with your actual Railway domain.

</Step>

<Step title="Add a custom domain" badge="optional">

For better blocking resistance, use your own domain instead of Railway's default:

1. Go to your Railway project's **Settings** → **Networking**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Follow [Railway's custom domains guide](https://docs.railway.app/guides/public-networking#custom-domains) to configure DNS

Then update your SDK to use your custom domain:

<MultiLanguage>

```js file=US
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: 'https://e.yourdomain.com',
  ui_host: 'https://us.posthog.com'
})
```

```js file=EU
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: 'https://e.yourdomain.com',
  ui_host: 'https://eu.posthog.com'
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Verify your setup">

Confirm events are flowing through your proxy:

1. Test the proxy directly:

   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-project-name.up.railway.app/decide?v=3
   ```
   You should see a `200 OK` response.

2. Open your browser's developer tools and go to the **Network** tab
3. Trigger an event in your app
4. Look for requests to your Railway domain
5. Verify the response status is `200 OK`
6. Check the [PostHog app](https://app.posthog.com) to confirm events appear

If you see errors, check [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy stops working periodically

If your proxy stops responding intermittently:

1. **Check sleep settings:** Free tier services may sleep after inactivity. Go to **Settings** → **Service** and check if sleep mode is enabled.
2. **Monitor resource usage:** Check the **Metrics** tab for memory or CPU spikes that might cause restarts.
3. **View logs:** Look for error messages in the **Deployments** tab.
4. **Consider upgrading:** Paid plans include better uptime guarantees and disable sleep mode.

If issues persist, check [Railway's status page](https://status.railway.app/).

### Deployment failed

If the initial deployment fails:

1. Check the build logs for error messages
2. Verify you set the `POSTHOG_CLOUD_REGION` variable correctly (must be `us` or `eu`)
3. Try redeploying from the Railway dashboard

### 502 Bad Gateway errors

If the proxy returns 502 errors:

1. Verify the `POSTHOG_CLOUD_REGION` variable matches your PostHog project's region
2. Check that the Railway service is running in the dashboard
3. View the service logs for connection errors

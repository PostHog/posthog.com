If you are using Next.js, you can take advantage of [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) to behave like a reverse proxy. To do so, add a `rewrites()` function and the `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` option to your `next.config.js` file: 

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/ingest/static/:path*",
        destination: "https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/:path*",
      },
      {
        source: "/ingest/:path*",
        destination: "https://us.i.posthog.com/:path*",
      },
      {
        source: "/ingest/decide",
        destination: "https://us.i.posthog.com/decide",
      },
    ];
  },
  // This is required to support PostHog trailing slash API requests
  skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true, 
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

Then configure the PostHog client to send requests via your rewrite.

```js
posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
  api_host: "/ingest",
  ui_host: '<ph_app_host>'
})
```

> If this isn't working for you (returning `503` or `400` errors), it may be an issue with how your hosting service (such as Heroku or Netlify) handles rewrites. You can write [Next.js middleware](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs-middleware) or use a host-specific proxy (like [Netlify](/docs/advanced/proxy/netlify)) instead.
> For example, Netlify modifies the `Content-Encoding` header when using `rewrites()`, which causes PostHog to fail to parse the request. This doesn't happen if you use their `_redirects` file or `netlify.toml` options.

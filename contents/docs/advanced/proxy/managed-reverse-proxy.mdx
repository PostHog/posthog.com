PostHog's Managed Reverse Proxy feature allows you to route traffic through PostHog's managed infrastructure, simplifying the deployment and management of your PostHog instance. This guide will walk you through the setup and configuration process.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Managed Reverse Proxy, ensure you have the following:
- A PostHog Cloud account with the [Teams add-on](https://posthog.com/pricing#addons)
- Access to your domain's DNS settings.

## Creating A Managed Reverse Proxy

1. Navigate to [organization proxy](https://us.posthog.com/settings/organization-proxy) settings
2. Click "New Managed Proxy"
3. Enter a subdomain that you control. For example if you run posthog on `myapp.com`, you could use `ph.myapp.com`
4. Go to your DNS provider and create a new CNAME record for this subdomain
  - You will be shown a domain to set as the CNAME record, it will look something like `4854cf84789d8596ad01.proxy-us.posthog.com.`
5. Wait for the proxy to be created. It will go from "Waiting", to "Issuing" and finally "Live" once everything is set up. There is no further action required after creating the DNS record.
6. Update your PostHog snippet or SDK to use your new subdomain as the `api_host`.

### Setting DNS Records In Cloudflare

If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, please ensure you have disabled proxying on the CNAME record (DNS Only)

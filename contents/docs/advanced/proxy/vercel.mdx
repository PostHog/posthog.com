Vercel supports [rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#rewrites) which we can use as a reverse proxy. Create a `vercel.json` file and add a `rewrites` object from a custom route.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/<ph_proxy_path>/static/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/<ph_proxy_path>/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://us.i.posthog.com/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Some frameworks, like T3 app, don't support Vercel rewrites well. In this scenario we recommend trying another proxy method.

Once done, set the `/<ph_proxy_path>/` route of your domain as the API host in your PostHog initialization like this:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: 'https://www.your-domain.com/<ph_proxy_path>/',
  ui_host: '<ph_app_host>',
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
})
```

Once updated, deploy your changes on Vercel and check that PostHog requests are going to `https://www.your-domain.com/<ph_proxy_path>/` by checking the network tab on your domain.

Netlify supports [redirects and rewrites](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file) which we can use as a reverse proxy from a custom route. In your `netlify.toml` file, add a redirect like this:

```js
[[redirects]]
  from = "/<ph_proxy_path>/static/*"
  to = "https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/:splat"
  host = "us-assets.i.posthog.com"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/<ph_proxy_path>/*"
  to = "https://us.i.posthog.com/:splat"
  host = "us.i.posthog.com"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

> **Note:** If deploying SvelteKit on Netlify use `_redirects` file and place it in the project root, as redirects in `netlify.toml` configuration [are not supported](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/sveltekit/#limitations).

```js
/<ph_proxy_path>/static/*  https://us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/:splat  200!
/<ph_proxy_path>/*         https://us.i.posthog.com/:splat  200!
```

> **Note:** This proxy configuration works with custom domains but may not work correctly with the default `.netlify.app` domain. If you're experiencing issues with PostHog requests being blocked, ensure you're using a custom domain rather than the default Netlify domain.

Once done, set the `/<ph_proxy_path>` route of your domain as the API host in your PostHog initialization like this:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: 'https://www.your-domain.com/<ph_proxy_path>',
  ui_host: '<ph_app_host>',
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
})
```

Once updated, deploy your changes on Netlify and check that PostHog requests are going to `https://www.your-domain.com/<ph_proxy_path>` by checking the network tab on your domain.

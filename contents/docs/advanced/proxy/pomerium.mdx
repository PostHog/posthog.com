[Pomerium](https://www.pomerium.com/) is an identity-aware proxy that can be used to securely proxy traffic to PostHog. This guide will show you how to configure Pomerium as a reverse proxy for PostHog.

## Set up with Pomerium Zero

The assumption is you've already set up [Pomerium Zero](https://www.pomerium.com/zero).

### 1. Create an Optional Allow All Policy

1. [Log in to Pomerium Zero](https://console.pomerium.app/).
1. Click on Manage -> Policies in the side bar.
1. Click the New Policy button to create a new policy.

1. Name the policy `allow all` or something similar.
1. Set the Policy Enforcement field to `Optional`.
1. In the Overrides section, enable Public Access.
1. Click the Save Policy button to save the policy.
1. The `allow all` policy has been created.

### 2. Create the main PostHog Route

1. Click on the New Route button to create a new route.
1. Select Custom Route from the list of route types.

1. Name the Route PostHog
1. Set the From field to, e.g. `https://e.some-name.pomerium.app`
1. Set the To field to `https://us.i.posthog.com`.
1. In the Policies drop down, select the `allow all` policy created so the analytics will run for everyone.
1. Click the Save Route button to save the route.

### 3. Create the PostHog Assets Route

1. Click on the New Route button to create a new route.
1. Select Custom Route from the list of route types.
1. Name the Route PostHog Assets
1. Set the From field to, e.g. `https://e.some-name.pomerium.app`
1. Set the To field to `https://us-assets.i.posthog.com`.
1. In the Policies drop down, select the `allow all` policy created so the analytics will run for everyone.
1. Click on the Path Matching link in the edit route side bar.
1. Set the Prefix field to `/static`.

Pomerium Zero is now configured to proxy PostHog.

## Set up with Pomerium Core

Assuming [Pomerium Core](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/deploy/core) is set up, open your [config.yaml](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/deploy/core#configuration) to configure Pomerium to proxy requests to PostHog by adding the following routes to your Pomerium config file:

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://e.some-name.pomerium.app
    to: https://us.i.posthog.com
    policy:
      - allow:
          or:
            - public: true
    name: "PostHog"

  - from: https://e.some-name.pomerium.app
    to: https://us-assets.i.posthog.com
    prefix: "/static"
    policy:
      - allow:
          or:
            - public: true
    name: "PostHog Assets"

# rest of your configuration
```

## Use the Pomerium URL in your PostHog initialization

Once everything is configured, set the the API host to e.g. `https://e.some-name.pomerium.app` in your PostHog initialization like this:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    api_host: 'https://e.some-name.pomerium.app',
  }
)
```

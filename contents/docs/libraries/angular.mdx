PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your [Angular](https://angular.dev/) app. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Angular app using the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js).

## Installation

import AngularInstall from "../integrate/_snippets/install-angular.mdx"

<AngularInstall />

> **Note:** If you're using Typescript, you might have some trouble getting your types to compile because we depend on `rrweb` but don't ship all of their types. To accommodate that, you'll need to add `@rrweb/types@2.0.0-alpha.17` and `rrweb-snapshot@2.0.0-alpha.17` as a dependency if you want your Angular compiler to typecheck correctly.
>
> Given the nature of this library, you might need to completely clear your `.npm` cache to get this to work as expected. Make sure your clear your CI's cache as well.
>
> In the rare case the versions above get out-of-date, you can check our [JavaScript SDK's `package.json`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/package.json) to understand what's the exact version you need to depend on.

## Tracking pageviews

PostHog automatically tracks your pageviews by hooking up to the browser's `navigator` API as long as you initialize PostHog with the `defaults` config option set after `2025-05-24`.

## Capture custom events

To [capture custom events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events), import `posthog` and call `posthog.capture()`. Below is an example of how to do this in a component:

```typescript file=app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

@Component({
 // existing component code
})

export class AppComponent {
  handleClick() {
    posthog.capture(
      'home_button_clicked', 
    )
  }
}
```

## Session replay

Session replay uses change detection to record the DOM. This can clash with Angular's change detection.

The recorder tool attempts to detect when an Angular zone is present and avoid the clash but might not always succeed.

If you see performance impact from recording in an Angular project, ensure that you use [`ngZone.runOutsideAngular`](https://angular.io/api/core/NgZone#runoutsideangular). 

```ts file=posthog.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class PostHogSessionRecordingService {
  constructor(private ngZone: NgZone) {}
initPostHog() {
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      posthog.init(
        /* your config */
      )
    })
  }
}
```

## Idiomatic service for Angular v17 and above

For larger projects, you might prefer to set up PostHog as a singleton service. To do this, start by creating and injecting a `PosthogService` instance:

```ts file=main.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { RouterOutlet } from "@angular/router";
import { PosthogService } from "./services/posthog.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.scss"],
  template: `
    <router-outlet />`,
  imports: [RouterOutlet],
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = "angular-app";

  constructor(posthogService: PosthogService) {}
}
```

The service itself looks like this:
```ts file=posthog.service.ts
import { DestroyRef, Injectable, NgZone } from "@angular/core";
import posthog from "posthog-js";
import { environment } from "../../environments/environment";
import { Router } from "@angular/router";

@Injectable({ providedIn: "root" })
export class PosthogService {
  constructor(
    private ngZone: NgZone,
    private router: Router,
    private destroyRef: DestroyRef,
  ) {
    this.initPostHog();
  }
  private initPostHog() {
    this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
      posthog.init(environment.posthogKey, {
        api_host: environment.posthogHost,
        defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>'
        debug: false,
        cross_subdomain_cookie: true,
      });
    });
  }
}
```

This service contains PostHog initialization.

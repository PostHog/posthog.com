## Why does this exist?

Our Sentry integration is a two-way integration which works on JavaScript & Python. Once installed, it will:

- Add a direct link in Sentry to the profile of the person affected in PostHog.
- Send an `$exception` event to PostHog with a direct link to Sentry.

This way, debugging issues becomes a lot easier, and you can also correlate error data with your product metrics.

> If you're looking for the PostHog + Sentry integration for Python, please check out the [Python docs](/docs/integrate/server/python#sentry).

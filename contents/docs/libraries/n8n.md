This n8n app enables you to automate PostHog workflows and create workflows using other services, using n8n.

## Getting started

The n8n app is an API integration. You will need a [PostHog Personal API key](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys), which must be [authenticated with n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/posthog/) to [connect n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.posthog/#basic-operations) and get started.

For more information, please check [n8n's integration documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/posthog/#posthog).

## Requirements

This requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog)!

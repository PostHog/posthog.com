This is an optional library you can install if you're working with PHP. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance.

## Installation

Add the following to composer.json:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "posthog/posthog-php": "3.0.*"
    }
}
```
And then install the dependencies with the command: `php composer.phar install`

In your app, set your API key before making any calls.

```php
PostHog::init("<ph_project_api_key>",
  array('host' => '<ph_instance_address>') // You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com
);
```

> **Note:** As a general rule of thumb, we do not recommend having API keys in plaintext. Setting it as an environment variable would be best.

You can find your key in the 'Project Settings' page in PostHog.

## Making calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:
 - `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
 - `event name` to specify the event
  * We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:
- `properties`, which is an array with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
  'distinctId' => 'user:123',
  'event' => 'movie played',
  'properties' => array(
    'movieId' => '123',
    'category' => 'romcom'
  )
));
```

### Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => 'distinct_id',
    'event' => 'event_name',
    'properties' => array(
        '$set' => array(
            'name' => 'Max Hedgehog'
        ),
        '$set_once' => array(
            'initial_url' => '/blog'
        )
    )
));
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

### Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.
### Sending page views

If you're aiming for a backend-only implementation of PostHog and won't be capturing events from your frontend, you can send `pageviews` from your backend like so:

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
  'distinctId' => 'user:123',
  'event' => '$pageview',
  'properties' => array(
    '$current_url' => 'https://example.com'
  )
));
```

### Feature flags

#### How to check if a flag is enabled

To check if a feature flag is enabled for a given user, use `isFeatureEnabled`, like so:

```php
if (PostHog::isFeatureEnabled('my-amazing-flag', 'some distinct id')) {
    // do something here
}
```

#### Get a flag value

if you're using multivariate feature flags, you can also get not just whether the flag is enabled, but what value its enabled to.

```php
PostHog::getFeatureFlag('multivariate-flag', 'some distinct id');
// returns string or true or false or null
```

#### Overriding server properties

Sometimes, you might want to evaluate feature flags using properties that haven't been ingested yet, or were set incorrectly earlier. You can do so by setting properties the flag depends on with these calls.

FOr example, if the `beta-feature` depends on the `is_authorized` property, and you know the value of the property, you can tell PostHog to use this property, like so:

```php
PostHog::getFeatureFlag('beta-feature', 'some distinct id', [], ["is_authorized" => true])
// the third argument is for groups
```

The same holds for groups. If you have a group name `organisation`, you can add properties like so:

```php
PostHog::getFeatureFlag('beta-feature', 'some distinct id', ["organisation" => "some-company"], [], ["organisation" => ["is_authorized" => true]])
```

#### Getting all flag values

You can also get all known flag values as well. This is useful when you want to seed a frontend client with initial known flags. Like all methods above, this also takes optional person and group properties, if known.

```php
PostHog::getAllFlags('distinct id')
```

#### Local Evaluation
> **Note:** To enable local evaluation of feature flags you must also set a `personal_api_key` when configuring the integration, as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
> **Note:** This feature requires version 3.0 of the library, which in turn requires a minimum PostHog version of 1.38

All feature flag evaluation requires an API request to your PostHog servers to get a response. However, where latency matters, you can evaluate flags locally. This is much faster, and requires two things to work:
1. The library must be initialised with a personal API key
2. You must know all person or group properties the flag depends on.
Then, the flag can be evaluated locally. The method signature looks exactly like above.

```php
PostHog::getFeatureFlag('beta-feature', 'some distinct id', [], ["is_authorized" => true])
// the third argument is for groups
```

This works for `getAllFlags` as well. It evaluates all flags locally if possible. If even one flag isn't locally evaluable, it falls back to decide.

```php
PostHog::getAllFlags('distinct id', ["organisation" => "some-company"], [], ["organisation" => ["is_authorized" => true]])
```

**Restricting evaluation to local only**
Sometimes, performance might matter to you so much that you never want an HTTP request roundtrip delay when computing flags. In this case, you can set the `onlyEvaluateLocally` parameter to true, which tries to compute flags only with the properties it has. If it fails to compute a flag, it returns `None`, instead of going to PostHog's servers to get the value.

### Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```php
$variant = PostHog::getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key', 'user_distinct_id')

if ($variant === 'variant-name') {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). This feature requires a posthog-php version of `2.1.0` or above. Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => '[distinct id]',
    'event' => 'some event',
    '$groups' => array("company" => "42dlsfj23f")
));
```

-   Update properties on a group

```php
PostHog::groupIdentify(array(
    'groupType' => 'company',
    'groupKey' => '42dlsfj23f',
    'properties' => array("name" => "Awesome Inc.", "employees" => 11)
));
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-php` package.

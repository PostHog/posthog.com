This is an optional library you can install if you're working with PHP. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import PHPInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-php.mdx'

<PHPInstall />

## Capturing events

import PHPSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-php.mdx'

<PHPSendEvents />

## Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => 'distinct_id',
    'event' => 'event_name',
    'properties' => array(
        '$set' => array(
            'name' => 'Max Hedgehog'
        ),
        '$set_once' => array(
            'initial_url' => '/blog'
        )
    )
));
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

## Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import PHPFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-php.mdx'

<PHPFeatureFlagsCode />

import LocalEvaluationIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/local-evaluation-intro.mdx"

### Local Evaluation

<LocalEvaluationIntro />

For details on how to implement local evaluation, see our [local evaluation guide](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation).

### Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```php
$variant = PostHog::getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key', 'user_distinct_id')

if ($variant === 'variant-name') {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). This feature requires a posthog-php version of `2.1.0` or above. Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => '[user distinct id]',
    'event' => 'some event',
    '$groups' => array("company" => "company_id_in_your_db")
));
```

-   Update properties on a group

```php
PostHog::groupIdentify(array(
    'groupType' => 'company',
    'groupKey' => 'company_id_in_your_db',
    'properties' => array("name" => "Awesome Inc.", "employees" => 11)
));
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-php` package.

import FlutterIdentify from './\_snippets/identify.mdx'

This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Flutter. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

PostHog supports the iOS, macOS, Android and Web platforms.

## Installation

import FlutterInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-flutter.mdx'

<FlutterInstall />

## Usage

### Example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      navigatorObservers: [
        // The PosthogObserver records screen views automatically
        PosthogObserver(),
      ],
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('PostHog example app'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: FlatButton(
            child: Text('TRACK ACTION WITH PostHog'),
            onPressed: () async {
              await Posthog().capture(
                eventName: 'ButtonClicked',
                properties: {
                  'foo': 'bar',
                  'number': 1337,
                  'clicked': true,
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      )
    );
  }
}
```

## Capturing events

import FlutterSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-flutter.mdx'

<FlutterSendEvents />

## Identifying users

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

<FlutterIdentify />

## Get the current user's distinct ID

You may find it helpful to get the current user's distinct ID. For example, to check whether you've already called `identify` for a user or not.

To do this, call `PostHog().getDistinctId()`. This returns either the ID automatically generated by PostHog or the ID that has been passed by a call to `identify()`.

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend. 

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```dart
await Posthog().alias(
  alias: 'distinct_id',
);
```

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Anonymous vs identfied events

### How to capture anonymous events

## Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a `$screen`, or anything else.

They are set using `Posthog().register`, which takes a key and value, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```dart
import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

await Posthog().register("team_id", 22)
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `team_id = 22`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `Posthog().register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `Posthog().identify`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

### Removing stored Super Properties

Super Properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events, you can use `Posthog().unregister`, like so:

```dart
import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

await Posthog().unregister("team_id")
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply use `Posthog().reset` which takes care of clearing all stored Super Properties and more.

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```dart
await Posthog().group(groupType: "company", groupKey: "company_id_in_your_db");
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```swift
await Posthog().group(
  groupType: "company", 
  groupKey: "company_id_in_your_db", 
  groupProperties: {
    "name": "ACME Corp"
});
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Feature Flags

## Session replay

> **Note: ** Session replay is supported on the Flutter Web, Android and iOS environments.

To set up [session replay web](/docs/session-replay) or [mobile session replay](/docs/session-replay/mobile) in your project, all you need to do is install the Flutter SDK, follow the [additional installation instructions](/docs/session-replay/installation?tab=Flutter) for the PostHog widget and observer, and enable "Record user sessions" in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay) and enable the `sessionReplay` option.

If you're using Flutter Web, also enable the [Canvas capture](/docs/session-replay/canvas-recording) in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay).  
This is needed as Flutter renders your app using a browser canvas element.

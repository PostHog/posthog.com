PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your [Remix](https://remix.run/) app. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Remix app using the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js).

## Installation

Install `posthog-js` using your package manager:

```bash
yarn add posthog-js
# or
npm install --save posthog-js
```

Then, go to `app/entry.client.tsx` and initialize PostHog as a component. You'll need both your API key and instance address (you can find these in your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/settings)).

```ts file=entry.client.tsx
import { RemixBrowser } from "@remix-run/react";
import { startTransition, StrictMode, useEffect } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import posthog from "posthog-js";

function PosthogInit() {
  useEffect(() => {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
      api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    });
  }, []);

  return null;
}

startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(
    document,
    <StrictMode>
        <RemixBrowser />
        <PosthogInit/>
    </StrictMode>
  );
});
```

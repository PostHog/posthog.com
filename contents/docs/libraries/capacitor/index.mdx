PostHog makes it easy to capture data from your Capacitor app, no matter the platform. You can find out more in the [plugin's documentation](https://capawesome.io/plugins/posthog/).


## Installation

import CapacitorInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-capacitor.mdx'

<CapacitorInstall />

## Capturing events

import CapacitorSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-capacitor.mdx'

<CapacitorSendEvents />

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

Feature flags are not yet supported by this library, but you can still use them [via the API](/docs/api/decide). If you would like to contribute, please check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/capawesome-team/capacitor-plugins/tree/main/packages/posthog).

## Group analytics

Group analytics enable you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [group analytics docs](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

To associate the events for this session with a group, call `group()`:

```js
import { Posthog } from '@capawesome/capacitor-posthog';

const group = async () => {
  await Posthog.group({
    type: 'company',
    key: 'company_id_in_your_db',
  });
};
```

To associate the events for this session with a group **and** update the properties of that group, include the `groupProperties` property:

```js
import { Posthog } from '@capawesome/capacitor-posthog';

const group = async () => {
  await Posthog.group({
    type: 'company',
    key: 'company_id_in_your_db',
    groupProperties: {
      name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    },
  });
};
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Python. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import PythonInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-python.mdx'

<PythonInstall />

## Capturing events

import PythonSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-python.mdx'

<PythonSendEvents />

## Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```python
posthog.capture(
    'distinct_id',
    event='event_name',
    properties={
        '$set': {'name': 'Max Hedgehog'},
        '$set_once': {'initial_url': '/blog'}
    }
)
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

## Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/getting-started/identify-users) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import PythonFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-python.mdx'

<PythonFeatureFlagsCode />

### Local Evaluation

import LocalEvaluationIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/local-evaluation-intro.mdx"

<LocalEvaluationIntro />

For details on how to implement local evaluation, see our [local evaluation guide](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation).

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```python
variant = posthog.get_feature_flag('experiment-feature-flag-key', 'user_distinct_id')

if variant == 'variant-name':
    # Do something
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags). 

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```python
posthog.capture('[user distinct id]', 'some event', groups={'company': 'company_id_in_your_db'})
```

-   Update properties on a group

```python
posthog.group_identify('company', 'company_id_in_your_db', {
    'name': 'Awesome Inc.',
    'employees': 11
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## GeoIP properties

Before posthog-python v3.0, we added GeoIP properties to all incoming events by default. We also used these properties for feature flag evaluation, based on the IP address of the request. This isn't ideal since they are created based on your server IP address, rather than the user's, leading to incorrect location resolution.

As of posthog-python v3.0, the default now is to disregard the server IP, not add the GeoIP properties, and not use the values for feature flag evaluations.

You can go back to previous behaviour by doing setting the `disable_geoip` argument in your initialization to `False`:

```python
posthog = Posthog('api_key', disable_geoip=False)
```

The list of properties that this overrides:

1. $geoip_city_name
2. $geoip_country_name
3. $geoip_country_code
4. $geoip_continent_name
5. $geoip_continent_code
6. $geoip_postal_code
7. $geoip_time_zone

You can also explicitly chose to enable or disable GeoIP for a single capture request like so:

```python
posthog.capture('test id', 'test event', disable_geoip=True|False)
```

## Serverless environments (Render/Lambda/...)

By default, the library buffers events before sending them to the capture endpoint, for better performance. This can
lead to lost events in serverless environments, if the python process is terminated by the platform before the buffer
is fully flushed. To avoid this, you can either:

- ensure that `posthog.flush()` is called after processing every request, by adding a middleware to your server: this allows `posthog.capture()` to remain asynchronous for better performance.
- enable the `sync_mode` option when initializing the client, so that all calls to `posthog.capture()` become synchronous.

## Django

For Django, you can do the initialisation of the key in the AppConfig, so that it's available everywhere.

in `yourapp/apps.py`

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig
import posthog

class YourAppConfig(AppConfig):
    def ready(self):
        posthog.api_key = '<ph_project_api_key>'
        posthog.host = '<ph_instance_address>' # You can remove this line if you're using app.posthog.com

```

Then, anywhere else in your app you can do:

```python
import posthog

def purchase(request):
    # example capture
    posthog.capture(request.user.pk, 'purchase', ...)
```

# Integrations

## Sentry

When using [Sentry in Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/), you can connect to PostHog in order to link Sentry errors to PostHog user profiles.

### Example implementation

See the [`sentry_django_example`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/tree/master/sentry_django_example) project for a complete example.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration
from posthog.sentry.posthog_integration import PostHogIntegration

PostHogIntegration.organization = "orgname"

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration(), PostHogIntegration()],
)

# Also set `posthog_distinct_id` tag
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_tag('posthog_distinct_id', 'some distinct id')
```

### Example implementation with Django

This can be made automatic in Django, by adding the following middleware and settings to `settings.py`:

```python

MIDDLEWARE = [
    "posthog.sentry.django.PosthogDistinctIdMiddleware"
]

POSTHOG_DJANGO = {
    "distinct_id": lambda request: request.user and request.user.distinct_id
}
```

## Alternative name

As our open source project [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) shares the same module name, we created a special `posthoganalytics` package, mostly for internal use to avoid module collision. It is the exact same.

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-python` package.

The Python SDK uses nested contexts for managing state that's shared across events. Contexts are the recommended way to manage things like "which user is taking this action" (through `identify_context`), rather than manually passing user state through your apps stack.

When events (including exceptions) are captured in a context, the event uses the user [distinct ID](/docs/getting-started/identify-users), [session ID](/docs/data/sessions), and tags that are (optionally) set in the context. This is useful for adding properties to multiple events during a single user's interaction with your product.

You can enter a context using the `with` statement:

```python
from posthog import new_context, tag, set_context_session, identify_context

with new_context():
    tag("transaction_id", "abc123")
    tag("some_arbitrary_value", {"tags": "can be dicts"})

    # Sessions are UUIDv7 values and used to track a sequence of events that occur within a single user session
    # See https://posthog.com/docs/data/sessions
    set_context_session(session_id)

    # Setting the context-level distinct ID. See below for more details.
    identify_context(user_id)

    # This event is captured with the distinct ID, session ID, and tags set above
    posthog.capture("order_processed")
```

Contexts are persisted across function calls. If you enter one and then call a function and capture an event in the called function, it uses the context tags and session ID set in the parent context:

```python
from posthog import new_context, tag

def some_function():
    # When called from `outer_function`, this event is captured with the property some-key="value-4"
    posthog.capture("order_processed")


def outer_function():
    with new_context():
        tag("some-key", "value-4")
        some_function()

```

Contexts are nested, so tags added to a parent context are inherited by child contexts. If you set the same tag in both a parent and child context, the child context's value overrides the parent's at event capture (but the parent context won't be affected). This nesting also applies to session IDs and distinct IDs.

```python
from posthog import new_context, tag

with new_context():
    tag("some-key", "value-1")
    tag("some-other-key", "another-value")
    with new_context():
        tag("some-key", "value-2")
        # This event is captured with some-key="value-2" and some-other-key="another-value"
        posthog.capture("order_processed")

    # This event is captured with some-key="value-1" and some-other-key="another-value"
    posthog.capture("order_processed")

```

You can disable this nesting behavior by passing `fresh=True` to `new_context`:

```python
from posthog import new_context

with new_context(fresh=True):
    tag("some-key", "value-2")
    # This event only has the property some-key="value-2" from the fresh context
    posthog.capture("order_processed")

```

> **Note:** Distinct IDs, session IDs, and properties passed directly to calls to `capture` and related functions override context state in the final event captured.

### Contexts and user identification

Contexts can be associated with a distinct ID by calling `posthog.identify_context`:

```python
from posthog import identify_context

identify_context("distinct-id")
```

Within a context associated with a distinct ID, all events captured are associated with that user. You can override the distinct ID for a specific event by passing a `distinct_id` argument to `capture`:

```python
from posthog import new_context, identify_context

with new_context():
    identify_context("distinct-id")
    posthog.capture("order_processed") # will be associated with distinct-id
    posthog.capture("order_processed", distinct_id="another-distinct-id") # will be associated with another-distinct-id
```

It's recommended to pass the currently active distinct ID from the frontend to the backend, using the `X-POSTHOG-DISTINCT-ID` header. If you're using our Django middleware, this is extracted and associated with the request handler context automatically.

You can read more about identifying users in the [user identification documentation](/docs/product-analytics/identify).

### Contexts and sessions

Contexts can be associated with a session ID by calling `posthog.set_context_session`. Session IDs must be UUIDv7 strings.

```python
from posthog import new_context, set_context_session
with new_context():
    set_context_session(request.get_header("X-POSTHOG-SESSION-ID"))
```

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Using PostHog on your frontend too?">

If you're using the PostHog JavaScript Web SDK on your frontend, it generates a session ID for you.
You can pass it to your backend by adding your backend domain to `__add_tracing_headers` in your config. This will automatically add tracing headers to your requests.

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    __add_tracing_headers: ['your-backend-domain.com'] // +
});
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve it on the frontend by calling `posthog.get_session_id()`. You then need to pass that session ID to your backend by setting the `X-POSTHOG-SESSION-ID` header on each fetch request.

You need to extract the header in your request handler (if you're using our Django middleware integration, this happens automatically).

</CalloutBox>

If you associate a context with a session, you'll be able to do things like:
- See backend events on the session timeline when viewing session replays
- View session replays for users that triggered a backend exception in error tracking

You can read more about sessions in the [session tracking](/docs/data/sessions) documentation.

### Exception capture

By default exceptions raised within a context are captured and available in the [error tracking](/docs/error-tracking) dashboard. You can override this behavior by passing `capture_exceptions=False` to `new_context`:

```python
from posthog import new_context, tag

with new_context(capture_exceptions=False):
    tag("transaction_id", "abc123")
    tag("some_arbitrary_value", {"tags": "can be dicts"})

    # This event will be captured with the tags set above
    posthog.capture("order_processed")
    # This exception will not be captured
    raise Exception("Order processing failed")
```

### Decorating functions

The SDK exposes a function decorator. It takes the same arguments as `new_context` and provides a handy way to mark a whole function as being in a new context. For example:

```python
from posthog import scoped, identify_context

@scoped(fresh=True)
def process_order(user, order_id):
    identify_context(user.distinct_id)
    posthog.capture("order_processed") # Associated with the user
    raise Exception("Order processing failed") # This exception is also captured and associated with the user
```

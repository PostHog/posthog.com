This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import GoInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-go.mdx'

<GoInstall />

## Capturing events

import GoSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-go.mdx'

<GoSendEvents />

## Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "distinct_id",
    Event:      "event_name",
    Properties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "Max Hedgehog",
        },
        "$set_once": map[string]interface{}{
            "initial_url": "/blog",
        },
    },
})
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

## Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import GoFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-go.mdx'

<GoFeatureFlagsCode />

import LocalEvaluationIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/local-evaluation-intro.mdx"

### Local Evaluation

<LocalEvaluationIntro />

For details on how to implement local evaluation, see our [local evaluation guide](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation).

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:


```go
variant, err := client.GetFeatureFlag(
            FeatureFlagPayload{
                Key:        "experimentfeature-flag-name",
                DistinctId: "user_distinct_id",
            })

if variant == "variant-name" {
    // Do something
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Send an event associated with a group

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "user_distinct_id",
    Event:      "some_event",
    Groups: posthog.NewGroups().
        Set("company", "company_id_in_your_db"),
})
```

-   Update properties on a group

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.GroupIdentify{
    Type: "company",
    Key:  "company_id_in_your_db",
    Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
        Set("name", "Awesome Inc.").
        Set("employees", 11),
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-go` package.

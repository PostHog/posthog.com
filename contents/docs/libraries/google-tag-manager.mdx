[Google Tag Manager](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/) helps you add code snippets or tracking pixels to your website in a low-code way to send data to services like marketing and analytics tools. 

It is an easy way to integrate PostHog into your website without having to update your codebase. 

## How to add PostHog to Google Tag Manager

import GTMInstall from "../integrate/_snippets/install-gtm.mdx"

<GTMInstall />

> To confirm PostHog is configured correctly, visit your website and then check if the events from your session appear in [the activity tab](https://us.posthog.com/activity/explore). It may take a few minutes for events to appear.

## Using all the features of PostHog via Google Tag Manager

PostHog works the same via Google Tag Manager as it does via our snippet directly. This means you can use all of the features like session replays, surveys, and more without additional setup. 

Some of these do require calling PostHog, which you can do by checking for the window's `posthog` object and calling any of its methods. For example, you can capture a custom event like this:

```html
<script>
  (function waitForPosthog() {
    if (window.posthog) {
      window.posthog.capture('hello');
    } else {
      setTimeout(waitForPosthog, 100);
    }
  })();
</script>
```

You can find the full list of methods in our [JavaScript Web docs](/docs/libraries/js).

PostHog makes it easy to get data about usage of your [Hono](https://hono.dev/) app. Integrating PostHog into your app enables analytics, custom events capture, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog with your Hono app running on the [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs) runtime, but has also been tested with Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Bun. You can hook into the same middleware and `onError` for other runtimes to capture events.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide along, you need:

1. A PostHog instance (either [Cloud](https://app.posthog.com/signup) or [self-hosted](/docs/self-host))
2. A Hono application. We suggest trying first with a fresh [Hono Node.js starter template](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs#_1-setup).

## Installation

Start by installing the `posthog-node` package using your package manager.
```bash
npm install --save posthog-node
```

Then, create a [middleware](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/middleware) to capture events for your routes. Remember to **export** your [project API key](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#variables) as an environment variable.

```js file=index.ts
import { env } from 'hono/adapter'
import { createMiddleware } from 'hono/factory'
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

const posthog = new PostHog(process.env.POSTHOG_PUBLIC_KEY, { host: '<ph_client_api_host>' })

const posthogServerMiddleware = createMiddleware(async (c, next) => {

  posthog.capture({
      distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_user', // Their user id or email
      event: 'user_did_something',
  })

  await next()

  await posthog.flush() // TIP: On program exit, call flush to send any remaining events
})
```

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Shutdown">

Make sure to always call `posthog.shutdown()` after capturing events from the server-side. PostHog queues events into larger batches. This call forces all batched events to be flushed immediately.

</CalloutBox>

Next, apply this middleware to your app. This middleware will be called on every request handled by Hono, denoted by the wildcard `*`.

```ts file=index.ts
// use the middleware on all (*) routes.
app.use('*', posthogServerMiddleware)
```

In your routes, you can pass information to be captured by your middleware using [context `set()` and `get()` pair](https://hono.dev/docs/api/context#set-get)

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Cloudflare Pages">

Cloudflare Pages uses its own middleware system that is different from Hono's middleware. Follow the [Hono documentation on Cloudflare Pages](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/cloudflare-pages#cloudflare-pages-middleware) to handle middleware.

</CalloutBox>

## Error tracking

Hono uses [`app.onError`](https://hono.dev/docs/api/exception#handling-httpexception) for root-level error handling. You can take advantage of this for [Error tracking](/docs/error-tracking).

```ts file=index.ts
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

const posthog = new PostHog(process.env.POSTHOG_PUBLIC_KEY, { host: '<ph_client_api_host>' })

app.onError(async (err, c) => {
  posthog.captureException(err, 'user_distinct_id_with_err_rethrow', {
    path: c.req.path,
    method: c.req.method,
    url: c.req.url,
    headers: c.req.header(),
    // ... other properties
  })
  await posthog.flush() // TIP: On program exit, call flush to send any remaining events
  // other error handling logic
  return c.text('Internal Server Error', 500)
})
```

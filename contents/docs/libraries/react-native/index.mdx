Purely built for React Native, this library allows you to integrate PostHog with your React Native project. For React Native projects built with Expo, there are no mobile native dependencies outside of supported Expo packages.

## Installation

import ReactNativeInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-react-native.mdx'

<ReactNativeInstall />

## Usage

## Capturing events

import RNSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-react-native.mdx'

<RNSendEvents />

### Identify

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

import ReactNativeIdentify from './\_snippets/identify.mdx'

<ReactNativeIdentify />

#### Setting user properties via an event

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

##### $set_once

**Example**

```js
posthog.capture('some event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

**Usage**

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

### Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a $screen, an autocaptured touch, or anything else.

They are set using `posthog.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```js
posthog.register({
    'icecream pref': 'vanilla',
    team_id: 22,
})
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"icecream pref": "vanilla"` and `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `icecream_pref = vanilla`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `posthog.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `posthog.identify`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

#### Removing stored Super Properties

Super Properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events, you can use `posthog.unregister`, like so:

```js
posthog.unregister('icecream pref'),
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply use `posthog.reset` which takes care of clearing all stored Super Properties and more.

### Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have gathered.

You can also manually flush the queue, like so:

```javascript
posthog.flush()
// or using async/await
await posthog.flushAsync()
```

### Reset

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```javascript
posthog.reset()
```

### Opt in/out

By default, PostHog has tracking enabled unless it is forcefully disabled by default using the option `{ enable: false }`.

You can give your users the option to opt in or out by calling the relevant methods. Once these have been called they are persisted and will be respected until optIn/Out is called again or the `reset` function is called.

To Opt in/out of tracking, use the following calls.

```javascript
posthog.optIn() // opt in
posthog.optOut() // opt out
```

If you still wish capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

### Feature Flags

Feature Flags can be loaded directly or via a helpful hook

```js
import { useFeatureFlag } from 'posthog-react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const showFlaggedFeature = useFeatureFlag('my-flag-id')
    const multiVariantFeature = useFeatureFlag('my-multivariant-feature-flag-id')

    if (showFlaggedFeature === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    }

    return showFlaggedFeature ? <Text>Testing feature ðŸ˜„</Text> : <Text>Not Testing feature ðŸ˜¢</Text>
}
```

Alternatively you can call load the feature flags directly:

```js
// Defaults to undefined if not loaded yet or if there was a problem loading
posthog.getFeatureFlag('my-flag')
// Multi variant feature flags are returned as a string
posthog.getFeatureFlag('my-multivariant-flag')
```

PostHog will load feature flags when instantiated and will refresh whenever other methods are called that could affect the flag such as `.group()`. If you have the need to forcefully trigger the refresh however you can use `reloadFeatureFlagsAsync`

```js
posthog.reloadFeatureFlagsAsync().then((refreshedFlags) => console.log(refreshedFlags))
```

#### Bootstrapping Flags

There is a delay between loading the library and feature flags becoming available to use. For some cases, like redirecting users to a different page based on a feature flag, this is extremely detrimental, as the flags load after the redirect logic occurs, thus never working.

In cases like these, where you want flags to be immediately available on page load, you can use the bootstrap library option.

This allows you to pass in a distinctID and feature flags during library initialisation, like so:

```js
const posthog = await Posthog.initAsync('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    bootstrap: {
        distinctID: 'your-anonymous-id',
        featureFlags: {
            'flag-1': true,
            'variant-flag': 'control',
            'other-flag': false,
        },
    },
})
```

To compute these flag values, use the corresponding `getAllFlags` method in your server-side library. Note that bootstrapping flags requires server-side initialisation.

If the ID you're passing in is an identified ID (that is, an ID with which you've called `posthog.identify()` elsewhere), you can also pass in the `isIdentifiedID` bootstrap option, which ensures that this ID is treated as an identified ID in the library. This is helpful as it warns you when you try to do something wrong with this ID, like calling `identify` again.

```js
const posthog = await Posthog.initAsync('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    bootstrap: {
        distinctID: 'your-identified-id',
        isIdentifiedID: true,
        featureFlags: {
            'flag-1': true,
            'variant-flag': 'control',
            'other-flag': false,
        },
    },
})
```

> **Note:** Passing in a distinctID to bootstrap replaces any existing IDs, which means you may fail to connect any old anonymous user events with the logged in person, if your logic calls identify in the frontend immediately on login. In this case, you can omit passing in the distinctID.

### Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```react-native
// With the useFeatureFlag hook
import { useFeatureFlag } from 'posthog-react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const variant = useFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key')

    if (variant === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    }

    if (variant == 'variant-name') {
        // do something
    }
}           
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```js
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db')

posthog.capture('upgraded plan') // this event is associated with company ID `company_id_in_your_db`
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```js
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db', {
    name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    employees: 11,
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Upgrading from V1 to V2

V1 of this library utilised the underlying `posthog-ios` and `posthog-android` SDKs to do most of the work. Since the new version is written entirely in JS, using only Expo supported libraries, there are some changes to the way PostHog is configured as well as actually calling PostHog.

For iOS, the new React Native SDK will attempt to migrate the previously persisted data which should result in no unexpected changes to tracked data.

For Android, it is unfortunately not possible for persisted Android data to be loaded which means stored information such as the randomly generated `anonymousId` or the `distinctId` set by `posthog.identify` will not be present. For identified users, the simple workaround is to ensure that `identify` is called at least once when the app loads. For anonymous users there is unfortunately no straightforward workaround they will show up as new anonymous users in PostHog.

```jsx
// DEPRECATED V1 Setup

import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

await PostHog.setup('phc_ChmcdLbC770zgl23gp3Lax6SERzC2szOUxtp0Uy4nTf', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    captureApplicationLifecycleEvents: false, // Replaced by `PostHogProvider`
    captureDeepLinks: false, // No longer supported
    recordScreenViews: false, // Replaced by `PostHogProvider` supporting @react-navigation/native
    flushInterval: 30, // Stays the same
    flushAt: 20, // Stays the same
    android: {...}, // No longer needed
    iOS: {...}, // No longer needed
})

PostHog.capture("foo")


// V2 Setup difference
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

const posthog = await Posthog.initAsync('phc_ChmcdLbC770zgl23gp3Lax6SERzC2szOUxtp0Uy4nTf', {
    host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
    // Add any other options here.
})

// Use created instance rather than the PostHog class
posthog.capture("foo")
```

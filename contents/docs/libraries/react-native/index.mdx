The legacy parameter `evaluationEnvironments` (version 4.7.2+) is also supported for backward compatibility. |

## Capturing events

import RNSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-react-native.mdx'

<RNSendEvents />

## Autocapture 

PostHog autocapture can automatically track the following events for you:

-   **Application Opened** - when the app is opened from a closed state
-   **Application Became Active** - when the app comes to the foreground (e.g. from the app switcher)
-   **Application Backgrounded** - when the app is sent to the background by the user
-   **Application Installed** - when the app is installed.
-   **Application Updated** - when the app is updated.
-   **$screen** - when the user navigates (if using `@react-navigation/native` (v6 or lower) or `react-native-navigation`), check out the [capturing screen views](/docs/libraries/react-native#capturing-screen-views) section
-   **$autocapture** - touch events when the user interacts with the screen
-   **$exception** - when the app throws exceptions.

> ⚠️ **React Navigation v7 users**
>
> React Navigation v7 restricts navigation hooks (such as `useNavigationState`) to components rendered inside a Screen that belongs to a Navigator.
>
> Because of this change, automatic screen tracking may throw errors if PostHog is initialized outside a screen context. This commonly affects apps upgrading from React Navigation v6 to v7.
>
> For React Navigation v7, we recommend disabling automatic screen capture for screens and manually calling `posthog.screen()` inside each screen component. See the [Capturing screen views](/docs/libraries/react-native#capturing-screen-views) section below.

With autocapture, all touch events for children of `PosthogProvider` are tracked, capturing a snapshot of the view hierarchy at that point. This enables you to create [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights) in PostHog without having to add custom events.

PostHog will try to generate a sensible name for the touched element based on the React component `displayName` or `name`. If you prefer, you can set your own name using the `ph-label` prop:

```react-native
<View ph-label="my-special-label"></View>
```

### Autocapture configuration

import AutocaptureConfigs from './_snippets/autocapture-config-rn.mdx'

<AutocaptureConfigs/>

### Preventing sensitive data capture

If there are elements you don't want to be captured, you can add the `ph-no-capture` property. If this property is found anywhere in the view hierarchy, the entire touch event is ignored:

```react-native
<View ph-no-capture>Sensitive view here</View>
```

## Identifying users

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

import ReactNativeIdentify from './_snippets/identify.mdx'

<ReactNativeIdentify />

## Get the current user's distinct ID

You may find it helpful to get the current user's distinct ID. For example, to check whether you've already called `identify` for a user or not.

To do this, call `posthog.get_distinct_id()`. This returns either the ID automatically generated by PostHog or the ID that has been passed by a call to `identify()`.

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend. 

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```react-native
// Sets alias for current user
posthog.alias('distinct_id')
```

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Setting person properties

Person properties enable you to capture, manage, and analyze specific data about a user. You can use them to create [filters](/docs/product-analytics/trends#filtering-events-based-on-properties) or [cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts), which can then be used in [insights](/docs/product-analytics/insights), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), and more.

To set a user's properties, include the `$set` or `$set_once` property when capturing any event:

### $set

```js
posthog.capture('some_event', { $set: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

### $set_once

`$set_once` works just like `$set`, except it **only sets the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

```js
posthog.capture('some_event', { $set_once: { userProperty: 'value' } })
```

## Super properties

Super properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a `$screen`, an autocaptured touch, or anything else.

They are set using `posthog.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example:

```js
posthog.register({
    'icecream pref': 'vanilla',
    team_id: 22,
})
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"icecream pref": "vanilla"` and `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `icecream_pref = vanilla`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `posthog.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

This does **not** set the user's properties. This only sets the properties for their events. To store person properties, see the [setting person properties section](#setting-user-properties).

### Removing stored super properties

Super Properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events, you can use `posthog.unregister`, like so:

```js
posthog.unregister('icecream pref'),
```

This will remove the super property and subsequent events will not include it.

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply [`posthog.reset()`](#reset-after-logout) which takes care of clearing all stored Super Properties and more.

## Opt out of data capture

You can completely opt-out users from data capture. To do this, there are two options:

1. Opt users out by default by setting `opt_out_capturing_by_default` to `true` in your PostHog config:

```javascript
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    opt_out_capturing_by_default: true,
});
```

2. Opt users out on a per-person basis by calling `opt_out_capturing()`:

```javascript
posthog.opt_out_capturing()
```

Similarly, you can opt users in:

```javascript
posthog.opt_in_capturing()
```

To check if a user is opted out:

```javascript
posthog.has_opted_out_capturing()
```

## Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

You can also configure the flush interval. By default we flush all events after `30` seconds,
no matter how many events have gathered.

You can also manually flush the queue. If a flush is already in progress it returns a promise for the existing flush.

```javascript
await posthog.flush()
```

## Reset after logout

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```javascript
posthog.reset()
```

## Offline behavior

The PostHog React Native SDK will continue to capture events when the device is offline. When `persistence` is set to `file` (by default), the events are stored in a queue in the device's file storage. Even when the app is closed, the events are persisted and will be flushed when the app is opened again.

- The queue has a maximum size defined by `maxQueueSize` in the configuration.
- When the queue is full, the oldest event is deleted first.
- The queue is flushed only when the device is online.

## Opt in/out

By default, PostHog has tracking enabled unless it is forcefully disabled by default using the option `{ defaultOptIn: false }`.

You can give your users the option to opt in or out by calling the relevant methods. Once these have been called they are persisted and will be respected until optIn/Out is called again or the `reset` function is called.

To opt in/out of tracking, use the following calls.

```javascript
posthog.optedOut // See if a user has opted out
posthog.optIn() // opt in
posthog.optOut() // opt out
```

If you still wish capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

## Feature Flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import ReactNativeFeatureFlagsCode from "../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-react-native.mdx"

<ReactNativeFeatureFlagsCode />

### Bootstrapping Flags

import BootstrappingIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/bootstrapping-intro.mdx"

<BootstrappingIntro />

For details on how to implement bootstrapping, see our [bootstrapping guide](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping).

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```react-native
// With the useFeatureFlag hook
import { useFeatureFlag } from 'posthog-react-native'

const MyComponent = () => {
    const variant = useFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key')

    if (variant === undefined) {
        // the response is undefined if the flags are being loaded
        return null
    }

    if (variant == 'variant-name') {
        // do something
    }
}           
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note:**  This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more on the [pricing page](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```js
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db')

posthog.capture('upgraded_plan') // this event is associated with company ID `company_id_in_your_db`
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```js
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db', {
    name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    employees: 11,
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Error tracking

To set up error tracking in your project, follow the [React Native installation guide](/docs/error-tracking/installation/react-native).

## Session replay

To set up [session replay](/docs/session-replay/mobile) in your project, all you need to do is install the React Native SDK and the Session replay plugin, then follow the [instructions to enable Session Replay](/docs/session-replay/installation/react-native) for React Native.

## Surveys

To set up surveys, follow the [additional installation instructions for React Native](/docs/surveys/installation/react-native). Surveys launched with [popover presentation](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#presentation) are automatically shown to users matching the [display conditions](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#display-conditions) you set up.

> Note: URL and CSS selector targeting are not supported in React Native. Surveys that rely on these conditions will not appear.

## Debug mode 

If you're not seeing the expected events being captured, the feature flags being evaluated, or the surveys being shown, you can enable debug mode to see what's happening. 

You can enable debug mode by setting the `debug` option to `true` in the `PostHogProvider` options. This will enable verbose logs about the inner workings of the SDK.

```react-native
<PostHogProvider
    debug: {true}
    apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>"
    options={{
        host: "<ph_client_api_host>",
    }}
>
```

You can also call the `debug()` method in your code. 

```react-native
posthog.debug()
```

## Disabling for local development

You may want to disable PostHog when working locally or in a test environment. You can do this by setting the `disable` option to `true` when initializing PostHog. Helpfully this allows you to continue using `usePostHog` and safely calling it without anything actually happening.

```react-native
// App.(js|ts)
import { usePostHog, PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
...

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" options={{
            // Disable PostHog in development (or whatever other logic you choose)
            disabled: __DEV__,
        }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </PostHogProvider>
    )
}

const MyComponent = () => {
    const posthog = usePostHog()

    useEffect(() => {
        // Safe to call even when disabled!
        posthog.capture("mycomponent_loaded", { foo: "bar" })
    }, [])
}
```

## Upgrading from V1, V2 to V3 or V3 to V4

V1 of this library utilised the underlying `posthog-ios` and `posthog-android` SDKs to do most of the work. Since the new version is written entirely in JS, using only Expo supported libraries, there are some changes to the way PostHog is configured as well as actually calling PostHog.

For iOS, the new React Native SDK will attempt to migrate the previously persisted data (such as `distinctId` and `anonymousId`) which should result in no unexpected changes to tracked data.

For Android, it is unfortunately not possible for persisted Android data to be loaded which means stored information such as the randomly generated `anonymousId` or the `distinctId` set by `posthog.identify` will not be present. For identified users, the simple workaround is to ensure that `identify` is called at least once when the app loads. For anonymous users there is unfortunately no straightforward workaround they will show up as new anonymous users in PostHog.

Events such as `Application Installed` and `Application Updated` that require previously persisted data were unable to be migrated, the side effect being that you may see much higher numbers for `Application Installed` events. This is due to the fact that there is no native way of detecting a real "install" and as such, we store a marker the first time the SDK loads and treat that as an install.

```jsx
// DEPRECATED V1 Setup

import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

await PostHog.setup('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
    host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    captureApplicationLifecycleEvents: false, // Replaced by 'PostHogProvider'
    captureDeepLinks: false, // No longer supported
    recordScreenViews: false, // Replaced by 'PostHogProvider' supporting @react-navigation/native
    flushInterval: 30, // Stays the same
    flushAt: 20, // Stays the same
    android: {...}, // No longer needed
    iOS: {...}, // No longer needed
})

PostHog.capture("foo")


// V2 Setup difference
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

const posthog = await Posthog.initAsync('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
    host: '<ph_client_api_host>', 
    // Add any other options here.
})

// Use created instance rather than the PostHog class
posthog.capture("foo")

// V3 Setup difference
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
    host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    // Add any other options here.
})

// Use created instance rather than the PostHog class
posthog.capture("foo")

// V4 Setup difference
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    // usually 'https://us.i.posthog.com' or 'https://eu.i.posthog.com'
    host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    captureAppLifecycleEvents: true, // instead of `captureNativeAppLifecycleEvents` or `autocapture={{ captureLifecycleEvents: true }}`,
    // captureMode: 'json', // No longer supported
    // maskPhotoLibraryImages: true, // No longer supported
})

posthog.setPersonPropertiesForFlags(...) // instead of `personProperties`
posthog.setGroupPropertiesForFlags(...) // instead of `groupProperties`
```

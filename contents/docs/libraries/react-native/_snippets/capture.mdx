Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find 
patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

* `event` to specify the event name
  * We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

* `properties`, which is an object with any information you'd like to add

For example:

```javascript
posthog.capture('Button B Clicked', {
    color: "blue",
    icon: "new2-final"
})
```

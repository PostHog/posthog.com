### With the PosthogProvider

The recommended flow for setting up PostHog React Native is to use the `PostHogProvider` which utilises the Context API to pass the PostHog Client around as well as enabling autocapture and ensuring that the queue is flushed at the right time:

```jsx
// App.(js|ts)
import { usePostHog, PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-react-native'
...

export function MyApp() {
    return (
        <PostHogProvider apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>" options={{
            // (Optional) PostHog API host (https://app.posthog.com by default)
            host: '<ph_instance_address>',
        }}>
            <MyComponent />
        </PostHogProvider>
    )
}

// Now you can simply access posthog elsewhere in the app like so

const MyComponent = () => {
    const posthog = usePostHog()

    useEffect(() => {
        posthog.capture("MyComponent loaded", { foo: "bar" })
    }, [])
}
```


### Without the PosthogProvider

Due to the Async nature of React Native, PostHog needs to be initialised asynchronously in order for the persisted state to be loaded properly. The `PosthogProvider` takes care of this under-the-hood but you can alternatively create the instance yourself like so:

```tsx
// posthog.ts
import PostHog from 'posthog-react-native'

export let posthog: PostHog | undefined = undefined

export const posthogAsync: Promise<PostHog> = PostHog.initAsync('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // PostHog API host (https://app.posthog.com by default)
  host: '<ph_instance_address>'
})

posthogAsync.then(client => {
  posthog = client
})


// app.ts
import { posthog, posthogAsync} from './posthog'

export function MyApp1() {
    useEffect(async () => {
        // Use posthog optionally with the possibility that it may still be loading
        posthog?.capture('MyApp1 loaded')
        // OR use posthog via the promise
        (await posthogAsync).capture('MyApp1 loaded')
    }, [])

    return <View>Your app code</View>
}


// You can even use this instance with the PostHogProvider
export function MyApp2() {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthogAsync}>{/* Your app code */}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

### Configuration options

For most people, the default configuration options will work great but if you need to you can further customise how PostHog will work.

```ts
export const posthog = await PostHog.initAsync("<ph_project_api_key>", {
    // PostHog API host
    host?: string = "https://app.posthog.com",
    // The number of events to queue before sending to PostHog (flushing)
    flushAt?: number = 20,
    // The interval in milliseconds between periodic flushes
    flushInterval?: number = 10000
    // If set to false, tracking will be disabled until `optIn` is called
    enable?: boolean = true,
    // Whether to track that `getFeatureFlag` was called (used by Expriements)
    sendFeatureFlagEvent?: boolean = true,
    // Whether to load feature flags when initialised or not
    preloadFeatureFlags?: boolean = true,
    // How many times we will retry HTTP requests
    fetchRetryCount?: number = 3,
    // The delay between HTTP request retries
    fetchRetryDelay?: number = 3000,
    // For Session Analysis how long before we expire a session
    sessionExpirationTimeSeconds?: number = 1800 // 30 mins
    // Whether to post events to PostHog in JSON or compressed format
    captureMode?: 'json' | 'form'
})
```

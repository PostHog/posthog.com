PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) projects. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Phoenix app using the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js).

You might also be interested in our [Elixir SDK](/docs/libraries/elixir) for capturing events from your servers.

## Installation

import PhoenixInstall from "../integrate/_snippets/install-phoenix.mdx"

<PhoenixInstall />

### LiveView Installation

PostHog also supports Phoenix LiveView with a small tweak to your configuration. PostHog's JavaScript snippet doesn't track LiveView's navigations by default.

You'll need to add the following snippet to your main layout file, usually located in `lib/<app>/templates/layouts/app.html.eex` at the bottom of the `<head>` tag.

```javascript
window.addEventListener("phx:navigate", ({ detail: { href } }) =>
  posthog.capture('$pageview', {
    '$current_url': href
  })
 )
```

The `phx:navigate` event is triggered any time that the browser's URL bar is programatically changed by Phoenix or the user,
according to the [Phoenix LiveView documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html#navigate/2).


## Capture custom events

To [capture custom events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events), you can use `posthog.capture()` in your LiveView or regular Phoenix views. Here are some examples:

### Basic event capture

```javascript
// Capture a simple event
posthog.capture('button_clicked')
```

### Event capture with properties

```javascript
// Capture an event with additional properties
posthog.capture('form_submitted', {
    form_name: 'contact',
    form_fields: ['name', 'email', 'message'],
    submission_time: new Date().toISOString()
})
```

### Capturing events in LiveView

In your LiveView, you can capture events in response to user interactions:

```javascript
// In your LiveView JavaScript hooks
let Hooks = {
    Form: {
        mounted() {
            this.el.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
                e.preventDefault()
                posthog.capture('form_submitted', {
                    form_id: this.el.id,
                    form_data: new FormData(this.el)
                })
                // Handle form submission
            })
        }
    }
}

let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
    params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken},
    hooks: Hooks
})
```

### Capturing events in regular Phoenix views

For regular Phoenix views, you can add event tracking to your templates:

```html
<!-- In your template -->
<button phx-click="track_button_click" data-event-name="signup_button">
    Sign Up
</button>

<!-- In your JavaScript -->
document.addEventListener('phx:click', (e) => {
    if (e.target.dataset.eventName) {
        posthog.capture(e.target.dataset.eventName)
    }
})
```

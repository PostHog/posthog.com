Segment is a customer data platform (CDP) that enables you to capture data from many sources and send it to many destinations. This is a guide for our favorite one of those destinations: PostHog. 

> **Before you start...** we recommend you read our [CDP integration guide](/docs/integrate/cdp) to understand the different options for integrating with PostHog.

## Setting up Segment

Make sure you have a [Segment account](https://segment.com/docs/#getting-started) and a PostHog instance, using [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or self-hosted running [version 1.30.0](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

1. Once you have Segment and your source(s) set up, go to the **destinations** tab in your Segment workspace, click **Add Destination**, and search for [PostHog](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/posthog/).

2. After selecting PostHog, click **Add Destination**, choose your source(s), add a name, and click **Create destination**.

3. With the destination created, get your project API key and instance address from [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project). Add them to the fields under **Connection Settings**.

4. Once added, flip the toggle to enable the destination, and when you capture events from the source, you'll start to see them in PostHog.

### Enabling all of PostHog's features via Segment

The simple Segment destination only supports tracking of pageviews, custom events, and identifying users. To use the full feature set of PostHog like autocapture, session recording, feature flags, heatmaps, surveys, or the toolbar we need to load our own Javascript snippet directly.

1. In addition to Segment, install your [PostHog snippet](/docs/integrate/client/js#installation).

2. Modify the initialization to pass the Segment `analytics` object through for PostHog to sync with:

    ```js
    // Load PostHog JS
    !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.crossOrigin="anonymous",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="capture identify alias people.set people.set_once set_config register register_once unregister opt_out_capturing has_opted_out_capturing opt_in_capturing reset isFeatureEnabled onFeatureFlags getFeatureFlag getFeatureFlagPayload reloadFeatureFlags group updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment getEarlyAccessFeatures getActiveMatchingSurveys getSurveys getNextSurveyStep".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);

    // Segment script
    var analytics = "<Segment analytics snippet code>"; 
    analytics.load("<your-segment-key>");

    analytics.ready(() => {
        window.posthog.init("<your-posthog-key>", {
            api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>', // Use eu.i.posthog.com for EU instances
            segment: window.analytics, // Pass window.analytics here - NOTE: `window.` is important
            capture_pageview: false, // You want this false if you are going to use segment's `analytics.page()` for pageviews
            // When the posthog library has loaded, call `analytics.page()` explicitly.
            loaded: () => window.analytics.page(),
        });
    })
    ```

## Sending events to PostHog

Once you set up your Segment source and PostHog destination, you can send events via Segment to PostHog. You do this through one of its source libraries or its API. The PostHog destination supports the identify, track, page, screen, group, and alias definitions.

With the Analytics.js source, you can use `analytics.track('Event Name')` to send events to Segment, which is then sent to PostHog. For example, this sends a `user signed up` event with `plan` and `accountType` event properties and a `paid` person property to PostHog:

```js
analytics.track("user signed up", {
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Premium"
  $set: {
    paid: true
  }
});
```

Similarly, the `analytics.page()` function sends `$pageview` events and the `analytics.screen()` function sends `$screen` events to PostHog.


### Identifying users

To add identify users and add person properties, you can use Segment's `identify` function:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

This works similarly to PostHog's [`identify` function](/docs/product-analytics/identify):

1. It identifies anonymous users with a distinct ID, creating a person in PostHog.
2. It sets the person properties.

### Aliasing users

You can also assign multiple distinct IDs to the same user using Segment's `alias` function (the `previousId` argument is optional):

```js
analytics.alias('aliasId', 'previousId')  
```

See our [alias docs](/docs/product-analytics/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) for more details and restrictions.

### Using group analytics

Although Segment has a `group` definition, it works different than its equivalent in PostHog.

Calling `analytics.group()` in Segment sends a `$groupidentify` event and creates a `segment_group` type group with the ID you pass it. For example, this creates a `segment_group` type with the ID `Acme Corp`:

```js
analytics.group('Acme Corp')
```

If you want to set any group type on a user, you need to use the `$groups` property on the `track` call instead. For example, this creates a `company` type group with the ID `Twitter`:

```js
analytics.track('user_signed_up', {
    $groups: { company: 'Twitter' }
})
```

Also, unlike PostHog's JavaScript library's `group` method, you need to pass the `$groups` property on every Segment method call to have that data included.

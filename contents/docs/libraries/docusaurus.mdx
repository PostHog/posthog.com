To easily track your Docusaurus site, you can install the [PostHog plugin](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-docusaurus). This enables you to autocapture pageviews, clicks, session replays, as well as use the other features of PostHog such as [surveys](/docs/surveys). 

## Install

Once you have your Docusaurus site set up, install the PostHog plugin:

```bash
npm install --save posthog-docusaurus
```

or 

```bash
yarn add posthog-docusaurus
```

Next, add it to your Docusaurus config with your project API key and instance address, both of which you can find in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project).

```js
// docusaurus.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      "posthog-docusaurus",
      {
        apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>",
        appUrl: "<ph_client_api_host>", // optional, defaults to "https://us.i.posthog.com"
        enableInDevelopment: false, // optional
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

Run your site again to see events autocaptured by PostHog.

> **Note:**You can pass additional PostHog [config options](/docs/libraries/js/config) to the plugin, but they are passed through `JSON.stringify()`, so functions (such as `before_send`) are not supported.

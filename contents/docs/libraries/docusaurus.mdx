To easily track your Docusaurus site, you can install the [PostHog plugin](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-docusaurus). This enables you to autocapture pageviews, clicks, session replays, as well as use the other features of PostHog such as [surveys](/docs/surveys).

## Installation

<OnboardingContentWrapper>
    <DocusaurusInstallation />
</OnboardingContentWrapper>

> **Note:** You can pass additional PostHog [config options](/docs/libraries/js/config) to the plugin, but they are passed through `JSON.stringify()`, so functions (such as `before_send`) are not supported.

PostHog makes it easy to get data about usage of your [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) app. Integrating PostHog into your app enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session replays, feature flags, and more.

Select your Nuxt.js version to see the appropriate installation instructions:

## [Nuxt v3.7 and above](/docs/libraries/nuxt-js-3-7)

For Nuxt 3.7 and above, we recommend using the official `@posthog/nuxt` module. This module provides:
- Automatic PostHog client initialization for both Vue (client-side) and Nitro (server-side)
- Automatic exception capture for error tracking
- Sourcemap configuration and upload for error tracking

## [Nuxt v3.0 to v3.6](/docs/libraries/nuxt-js-3-6)

For Nuxt versions 3.0 to 3.6, follow the manual installation guide which includes setting up PostHog on both client and server side.

You can see a working example in our [Nuxt.js demo app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/tree/master/playground/nuxtjs).

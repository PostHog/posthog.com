> This [library](https://github.com/posthog/gatsby-plugin-posthog) was built by the community. Thanks to [Ritesh Kadmawala](https://github.com/kgritesh) for building it.

Gatsby behaves like a single-page app which means to track `$pageview` events special care is needed. This integration takes care of that.

## Install

```bash
yarn add gatsby-plugin-posthog
```

or

```bash
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-posthog
```

## How to use

```js
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-posthog`,
      options: {
        // Specify the API key for your PostHog Project (required)
        apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>",
        // Specify the app host if self-hosting (optional, default: https://us.i.posthog.com)
        apiHost: "<ph_client_api_host>",
        // Puts tracking script in the head instead of the body (optional, default: true)
        head: true,
        // Enable posthog analytics tracking during development (optional, default: false)
        isEnabledDevMode: true
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

This will automatically start tracking pageviews, clicks and more.

In your code you can access posthog via `window.posthog`.

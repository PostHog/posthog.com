If you're working with Node.js (versions 20+), the official `posthog-node` library is the simplest way to integrate your software with PostHog. This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance. And in addition to event capture, [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) are supported as well.

## Installation

import NodeInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-node.mdx'

<NodeInstall />

### Options

| Variable                      | Description                                                                                                           | Default value              |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `host`                        | Your PostHog host                                                                                                     | `https://us.i.posthog.com/`|
| `flushAt`                     | After how many capture calls we should flush the queue (in one batch)                                                 | `20`                       |
| `flushInterval`               | After how many ms we should flush the queue                                                                           | `10000`                    |
| `personalApiKey`              | An optional [personal API key](/docs/api/overview#personal-api-keys-recommended) for evaluating feature flags locally. Note: Providing this will trigger periodic calls to the feature flags service, even if you're not using feature flags. | `null`                     |
| `featureFlagsPollingInterval` | Interval in milliseconds specifying how often feature flags should be fetched from the PostHog API                    | `300000`                   |
| `requestTimeout`              | Timeout in milliseconds for any calls                                                                                 | `10000`                    |
| `maxCacheSize`                | Maximum size of cache that deduplicates $feature_flag_called calls per user.                                          | `50000`                    |
| `disableGeoip`                | When true, disables automatic GeoIP resolution for events and feature flags.                                          | `true`                     |
| `evaluation_contexts`         | Evaluation context tags that constrain which feature flags are evaluated. When set, only flags with matching evaluation context tags (or no evaluation context tags) will be returned. This helps reduce unnecessary flag evaluations and improves performance. See [evaluation contexts documentation](/docs/feature-flags/evaluation-contexts) for more details. Available in version 5.10.0+. The legacy parameter `evaluation_environments` (version 5.9.6+) is also supported for backward compatibility. | `undefined`                |

> **Note:** When using PostHog in an AWS Lambda function or a similar serverless function environment, make sure you set `flushAt` to `1` and `flushInterval` to `0`. Also, remember to always call `await posthog.shutdown()` at the end to flush and send all pending events.


## Capturing events

import NodeSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-node.mdx'

<NodeSendEvents />

## Person profiles and properties

The Node SDK captures identified events by default. These create [person profiles](/docs/data/persons). To set [person properties](/docs/data/user-properties) in these profiles, include them when capturing an event using `$set` and `$set_once`:

```node
client.capture({
  distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
  event: 'movie_played',
  properties: {
    $set: { name: 'Max Hedgehog'  },
    $set_once: { initial_url: '/blog' },
  },
})
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [person properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

To capture [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) without person profiles, set the event's `$process_person_profile` property to `false`:

```node
client.capture({
  distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
  event: 'movie_played',
  properties: {
    $process_person_profile: false,
  },
})
```

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend.

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```node
client.alias({
  distinctId: 'distinct_id',
  alias: 'alias_id',
})
```

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Contexts

> Requires `posthog-node` version >= 5.17.0.

The Node SDK uses nested contexts for managing state that's shared across events. Contexts are useful for adding properties to multiple events (including exceptions) during a single user's interaction with your product.

You can enter a context using `withContext`:

```node
posthog.withContext(
  {
    distinctId: 'user-123',
    properties: { transactionId: 'abc123' }
  },
  () => {
    // This event is captured with the distinct ID and properties set above
    posthog.capture({ event: 'order_processed' })
  }
)
```

Contexts are persisted across function calls. If you enter one and then call a function and capture an event in the called function, it uses the context properties set in the parent context:

```node
function someFunction() {
  // When called from `outerFunction`, this event is captured
  // with transactionId='abc123'
  posthog.capture({ event: 'order_processed' })
}

function outerFunction() {
  posthog.withContext(
    { properties: { transactionId: 'abc123' } },
    () => {
      someFunction()
    }
  )
}
```

By default, each context inherits from parent contexts. To disable nesting (where child contexts is fresh and has no properties), pass `{ fresh: true }`:

```node
posthog.withContext( // HIGHLIGHT
  {
    properties: {
      someKey: 'value-1',
      someOtherKey: 'another-value'
    }
  },
  () => {
    posthog.withContext( // HIGHLIGHT
      { properties: { someKey: 'value-2' } },
      () => {
        // Captured with someKey='value-2', someOtherKey='another-value'
        posthog.capture({ event: 'order_processed' })
      },
    )

    // Captured with someKey='value-1', someOtherKey='another-value'
    posthog.capture({ event: 'order_completed' })
  }
)
```

> **Note:** Properties passed directly to `capture` calls override context state in the final event.

### Identification context

Contexts can be associated with a distinct ID:

```node
posthog.withContext(
  { distinctId: 'user-123' },
  () => {
    // Associated with "user-123"
    posthog.capture({ event: 'order_processed' })

    // Overrides to "another-user"
    posthog.capture({
      distinctId: 'another-user',
      event: 'order_processed'
    })
  }
)
```

### Session context

```node
posthog.withContext(
  { sessionId: 'some-session' },
  () => {
    // Associated with session "some-session"
    posthog.capture({ event: 'image_uploaded' })

    // Overrides to "next-session"
    posthog.capture({
      event: 'image_uploaded',
      properties: { $sessionId: 'next-session' }
    })
  }
)
```

### Custom context parameters

```node
posthog.withContext(
  { flightNumber: 'TAC313' },
  () => {
    // Associated with flightNumber TAC313
    posthog.capture({ event: 'flight_cancelled' })

    // Overrides to PL7714
    posthog.capture({
      event: 'flight_cancelled',
      properties: { flightNumber: 'PL7714' }
    })
  }
)
```


## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import NodeFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-node.mdx'

<NodeFeatureFlagsCode />

import LocalEvaluationIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/local-evaluation-intro.mdx"

### Local evaluation

<LocalEvaluationIntro />

For details on how to implement local evaluation, see our [local evaluation guide](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation).

```node
const flagValue = await client.getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'user distinct id', {groups:{'organization': 'google'}, groupProperties:{'organization': {'is_authorized': True}})
```

#### Reloading feature flags

When initializing PostHog, you can configure the interval at which feature flags are polled (fetched from the server). However, if you need to force a reload, you can use `reloadFeatureFlags`:

```node
await client.reloadFeatureFlags()

// Do something with feature flags here
```

#### Distributed environments

In multi-worker or edge environments, you can implement custom caching for flag definitions using Redis, Cloudflare KV, or other storage backends. This enables sharing definitions across workers and coordinating fetches. See our guide for [local evaluation in distributed environments](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation/distributed-environments?tab=Node.js) for details.

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```node
const variant = await client.getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key', 'user_distinct_id')

if (variant === 'variant-name') {
  // do something
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Group analytics

Group analytics enable you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [group analytics guide](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) for more information.

To create a group or update its properties, use `groupIdentify`:

```node
client.groupIdentify({
  groupType: 'company',
  groupKey: 'company_id_in_your_db',
  properties: {
    name: 'Awesome Inc',
    employees: 11,
  },
  // optional distinct ID to associate event with an existing person
  distinctId: 'xyz'
})
```

`name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID is used instead.

If the optional `distinctId` parameter is not provided in the group identify call, it defaults to `${groupType}_${groupKey}` (e.g., `$company_company_id_in_your_db` in the example above). This default behavior results in each group appearing as a separate person in PostHog. To avoid this, it's often more practical to use a consistent `distinctId`, such as `group_identifier`.

Once a group is created, you can use the `capture` method and pass in the `groups` parameter to capture an event with group analytics.

```node
client.capture({
  event: 'some_event',
  distinctId: 'user_distinct_id',
  groups: { company: 'company_id_in_your_db' },
})
```

## GeoIP properties

Before `posthog-node` v3.0, we added GeoIP properties to all incoming events by default. We also used these properties for feature flag evaluation, based on the IP address of the request. This isn't ideal since they are created based on your server IP address, rather than the user's, leading to incorrect location resolution.

As of `posthog-node` v3.0, the default now is to disregard the server IP, not add the GeoIP properties, and not use the values for feature flag evaluations.

You can go back to previous behavior by setting `disableGeoip` to false in your initialization:

```node
const posthog = new PostHog('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
  disableGeoip: false
})
```

The list of properties that this overrides:

1. `$geoip_city_name`
2. `$geoip_country_name`
3. `$geoip_country_code`
4. `$geoip_continent_name`
5. `$geoip_continent_code`
6. `$geoip_postal_code`
7. `$geoip_time_zone`


You can also explicitly chose to enable or disable GeoIP for a single capture request like so:

```node
client.capture({
  distinctId: distinctId,
  event: 'your_event',
  disableGeoip: `true`,
})
```

## Shutdown

You should call `shutdown` on your program's exit to exit cleanly:

```node
// Stop pending pollers and flush any remaining events
await client.shutdown()
```

## Debug mode
If you're not seeing the expected events being captured, the feature flags being evaluated, or the surveys being shown, you can enable debug mode to see what's happening. 

You can enable debug mode by calling the `debug()` method in your code. This will enable verbose logs about the inner workings of the SDK.

```node
client.debug()
```

## Handling errors thrown by the SDK

If you are experiencing issues with the SDK it could be a number of things from an incorrectly configured API key, to some other network related issues.

The SDK does not throw errors for things happening in the background to ensure it doesn't affect your process. You can however hook into the errors to get more information:

```node
client.on("error", (err) => {
  // Whatever handling you want
  console.error("PostHog had an error!", err)
})
```

## Short-lived processes like serverless environments

The Node SDK is designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimize API calls and network time. As serverless environments like AWS Lambda or [Vercel Functions](/docs/libraries/vercel) are short-lived, we provide a few options to ensure all events are captured.

First, we recommend using the `captureImmediate` method instead of `capture` to ensure the event is captured before the function shuts down. It guarantees the HTTP request finishes before your function continues (or shuts down).

Second, we recommend setting `flushAt` to `1` and `flushInterval` to `0` to ensure the events are sent immediately. These set the queue to flush immediately, both in terms of events and time.

Third, we provide a method `shutdown()` which can be awaited to ensure all queued events are sent to the API. For example:

```node
export const handler() {
  client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
    event: 'thing_happened'
  })

  client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
    event: 'other_thing_happened'
  })

  // So far 2 events are queued but not sent

  // Calling shutdown, flushed the queue but batched into 1 API call for maximum efficiency
  await client.shutdown()
}
```

This is also useful for shutting down a standard Node.js app.

## LLM analytics

You can capture LLM usage and performance data by combining the `posthog-node` and `@posthog/ai` libraries. These work with LLM providers like OpenAI and Vercel's AI SDKs. Learn more in our [LLM analytics docs](/docs/llm-analytics).

## Error tracking

You can capture errors using the `posthog-node` library. This enables you to see stack traces, source code, and watch associated session recordings to improve your application stability. Learn more in our [error tracking docs](/docs/error-tracking/installation/node).

## Upgrading from V1 to V2

V2.x.x of the Node.js library is completely rewritten in Typescript and is based on a new JS core shared with other JavaScript based libraries with the goal of ensuring new features and fixes reach the different libraries at the same pace.

With the release of V2, the API was kept mostly the same but with some small changes and deprecations:

1. The minimum PostHog version requirement is 1.38
2. The `callback` parameter passed as an optional last argument to most of the methods is no longer supported
3. The method signature for `isFeatureEnabled` and `getFeatureFlag` is slightly modified. See the above documentation for each method for more details.
4. For specific changes, [see the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/packages/node/CHANGELOG.md)

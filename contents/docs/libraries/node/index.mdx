If you're working with Node.js, the official `posthog-node` library is the simplest way to integrate your software with PostHog. This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance. And in addition to event capture, [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) are supported as well.

## Installation

import NodeInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-node.mdx'

<NodeInstall />

| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |

> **Note:** When using PostHog in an AWS Lambda function or a similar serverless function environment, make sure you set `flushAt` to `1` and `flushInterval` to `0`. Also, remember to always call `await posthog.shutdownAsync()` at the end to flush and send all pending events.


## Capturing events

import NodeSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-node.mdx'

<NodeSendEvents />

## Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'movie played',
    properties: {
        $set: { name: 'Max Hedgehog'  },
        $set_once: { initial_url: '/blog' },
    },
})
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

## Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import NodeFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-node.mdx'

<NodeFeatureFlagsCode />

import LocalEvaluationIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/local-evaluation-intro.mdx"

### Local Evaluation

<LocalEvaluationIntro />

For details on how to implement local evaluation, see our [local evaluation guide](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation).

```node
const flagValue = await client.getFeatureFlag('flag-key', 'user distinct id', {groups:{'organisation': 'google'}, groupProperties:{'organisation': {'is_authorized': True}})
```

#### Reloading feature flags

When initializing PostHog, you can configure the interval at which feature flags are polled (fetched from the server). However, if you need to force a reload, you can use `reloadFeatureFlags`:

```node
await client.reloadFeatureFlags()

// Do something with feature flags here
```

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```node
const variant = await client.getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key', 'user_distinct_id')

if (variant === 'variant-name') {
    // do something
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```node
client.capture({
    event: 'some event',
    distinctId: '[user distinct id]',
    groups: { company: 'company_id_in_your_db' },
})
```

-   Update properties on a group

```node
client.groupIdentify({
    groupType: 'company',
    groupKey: 'company_id_in_your_db',
    properties: {
        name: 'Awesome Inc',
        employees: 11,
    },
    // optional distinct ID to associate event with an existing person
    distinctId: 'xyz'
})
```

## GeoIP properties

Before posthog-node v3.0, we added GeoIP properties to all incoming events by default. We also used these properties for feature flag evaluation, based on the IP address of the request. This isn't ideal since they are created based on your server IP address, rather than the user's, leading to incorrect location resolution.

As of posthog-node v3.0, the default now is to disregard the server IP, not add the GeoIP properties, and not use the values for feature flag evaluations.

You can go back to previous behavior by setting `disableGeoip` to false in your initialization:

```node
const posthog = new PostHog(PH_API_KEY, {
  host: PH_HOST,
  disableGeoip: false
})
```

The list of properties that this overrides:

1. $geoip_city_name
2. $geoip_country_name
3. $geoip_country_code
4. $geoip_continent_name
5. $geoip_continent_code
6. $geoip_postal_code
7. $geoip_time_zone


You can also explicitly chose to enable or disable GeoIP for a single capture request like so:

```node
client.capture({
  distinctId: distinctId,
  event: 'your-event',
  disableGeoip: `true`,
})
```

## Shutdown

You should call `shutdown` on your program's exit to exit cleanly:

```node
// Stop pending pollers and flush any remaining events
client.shutdown()
// or
await client.shutdownAsync()
```

## Debugging and exceptions

If you are experiencing issues with the SDK it could be a number of things from an incorrectly configured API key, to some other network related issues. 

The SDK does not throw errors for things happening in the background to ensure it doesn't affect your process. You can however hook into the errors to get more information:

```node
client.on("error", (err) => {
  // Whatever handling you want
  console.error("PostHog had an error!", err)
})
```

Or you can enable debugging to get verbose logs about all the inner workings of the SDK.

```node
client.debug()
```

## Using in a short-lived process like AWS Lambda

PostHogs's client SDKs are all designed to queue and batch requests in the background to optimise API calls and network time. For lambda environments (or also when shutting down a standard Node.js app) we provide a method .shutdownAsync which can be awaited and ensures the queued events are all flushed to the API.

For example:

```node
export const handler() {
  client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'thing happened'
  })

  client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct id',
    event: 'other thing happened'
  })

  // So far 2 events are queued but not sent

  // Calling shutdown, flushed the queue but batched into 1 API call for maximum efficiency
  await posthog.shutdownAsync()
}
```

## Upgrading from V1 to V2

V2.x.x of the Node.js library is completely rewritten in Typescript and is based on a new JS core shared with other JavaScript based libraries with the goal of ensuring new features and fixes reach the different libraries at the same pace.

With the release of V2, the API was kept mostly the same but with some small changes and deprecations:

1. The minimum PostHog version requirement is 1.38
2. The `callback` parameter passed as an optional last argument to most of the methods is no longer supported
3. The method signature for `isFeatureEnabled` and `getFeatureFlag` is slightly modified. See the above documentation for each method for more details.
4. For specific changes, [see the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/blob/master/posthog-node/CHANGELOG.md)

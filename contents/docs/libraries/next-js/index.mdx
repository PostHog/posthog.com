PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Next.js app using the [React](/docs/libraries/react) and the [Node.js](/docs/libraries/node) SDKs.

> You can see a working example of this integration in our [Next.js demo app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/tree/main/playground/nextjs).

Next.js has both client and server-side rendering, as well as pages and app routers. We'll cover all of these options in this guide.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide along, you need:

1. A PostHog instance (either [Cloud](https://app.posthog.com/signup) or [self-hosted](/docs/self-host))
2. A Next.js application

import AgentIntegrationSection from "../../components/AgentIntegrationSection.mdx"

<AgentIntegrationSection framework="Next.js" />

## Client-side setup

import NextJSInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/nextjs/install-nextjs.mdx"

<NextJSInstall />

<DetailSetUpReverseProxy />

<DetailGroupProductsInOneProject />

<DetailPostHogIPs />

## Accessing PostHog

import Tab from "components/Tab"
import InstrumentationClientSetup from "./_snippets/instrumentation-client-access.mdx"
import ProviderAccess from "./_snippets/provider-access.mdx"

<Tab.Group tabs={[
    'Instrumentation client', 
    'PostHog provider'
]}>
    <Tab.List>
        <Tab>Instrumentation client</Tab>
        <Tab>PostHog provider</Tab>
    </Tab.List>
    <Tab.Panels>
        <Tab.Panel>
            <InstrumentationClientSetup />
        </Tab.Panel>
        <Tab.Panel>
            <ProviderAccess />
        </Tab.Panel>
    </Tab.Panels>
</Tab.Group>

### Usage

See the [React SDK docs](/docs/libraries/react) for examples of how to use:

- [`posthog-js` functions like custom event capture, user identification, and more.](/docs/libraries/react#using-posthog-js-functions)
- [Feature flags including variants and payloads.](/docs/libraries/react#feature-flags)

You can also read [the full `posthog-js` documentation](/docs/libraries/js/features) for all the usable functions.

## Server-side analytics

import NextJSInstallServer from "../../integrate/_snippets/nextjs/install-nextjs-server.mdx"

<NextJSInstallServer />

### Server-side configuration

Next.js overrides the default `fetch` behavior on the server to introduce their own cache. PostHog ignores that cache by default, as this is Next.js's default behavior for any fetch call.

You can override that configuration when initializing PostHog, but make sure you understand the pros/cons of using Next.js's cache and that you might get cached results rather than the actual result our server would return. This is important for feature flags, for example.

```tsx
posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
  // ... your configuration
  fetch_options: {
    cache: 'force-cache', // Use Next.js cache
    next_options: {       // Passed to the `next` option for `fetch`
      revalidate: 60,     // Cache for 60 seconds
      tags: ['posthog'],  // Can be used with Next.js `revalidateTag` function
    },
  }
})
```

## Configuring a reverse proxy to PostHog

To improve the reliability of client-side tracking and make requests less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers, you can setup a reverse proxy in Next.js. Read more about deploying a reverse proxy using [Next.js rewrites](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs), [Next.js middleware](/docs/advanced/proxy/nextjs-middleware), and [Vercel rewrites](/docs/advanced/proxy/vercel).

## Frequently asked questions

### Does wrapping my app in the PostHog provider de-opt it to client-side rendering?

No. Even though the PostHog provider is a client component, since we pass the `children` prop to it, any component inside the children tree can still be a server component. Next.js creates a boundary between server-run and client-run code. 

The [`use client` reference](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client) says that it "defines the boundary between server and client code on the module dependency tree, not the render tree." It also says that "During render, the framework will server-render the root component and continue through the render tree, opting-out of evaluating any code imported from client-marked code."

Pages router components are client components by default.

### What does wrapping my app in the PostHog provider do?

On top of the standard features like autocapture, custom events, session recording, and more, wrapping your app in the PostHog provider gives you:

1. The `usePostHog`, `useFeatureFlagEnabled`, and other hooks in any component.
2. A PostHog context you can access in any component.
3. The `<PostHogFeature>` component which simplifies feature flag logic.

See the [React SDK docs](/docs/libraries/react) for more details.

### Why use a `useEffect` hook to initialize PostHog in the provider?

We want to initialize PostHog when the app is loaded. The [React docs](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) recommend using a `useEffect` hook to do this:

> Effects let you specify side effects that are caused by rendering itself, rather than by a particular event. 

Technically, you can also use a `window` object check to initialize PostHog. This happens outside the React lifecycle, meaning it happens earlier and it looks like this:

<MultiLanguage>

```js
// app/providers.js
'use client'
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { PostHogProvider } from '@posthog/react'

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
    api_host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
    capture_pageview: false // Disable automatic pageview capture, as we capture manually
  })
}

export function PHProvider({ children }) {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{children}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

```tsx
// app/providers.tsx
'use client'
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { PostHogProvider } from '@posthog/react'

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!, {
    api_host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
    capture_pageview: false // Disable automatic pageview capture, as we capture manually
  })
}

export function PHProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{children}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

</MultiLanguage>

The problem with this is that it can cause a [hydration and/or mismatch error](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error) like `Warning: Prop dangerouslySetInnerHTML did not match.`.

> **Tip:** If you experience hydration errors related to PostHog injecting scripts (for session recording, surveys, etc.), you can set `external_scripts_inject_target: 'head'` in your PostHog config. This tells PostHog to inject scripts into the document head instead of the body, avoiding DOM mutations that can interfere with React's hydration process. Alternatively, use `defaults: '2026-01-30'` or later which includes this setting by default. See the [JavaScript configuration docs](/docs/libraries/js/config#configuration-options) for more details.

### Why did the pageview component need a `useEffect`?

Before updating the JavaScript Web SDK's default behavior when capturing pageviews (`'2025-11-30'`), we suggested using a `useEffect` hook to capture pageviews. This is because it's the simplest way to accurately capture pageviews. Other approaches include:

1. Not using a `useEffect` hook, but this might lead to duplicate page views being tracked if the component re-renders for reasons other than navigation. It might work depending on your implementation.
2. Using `window.navigation` to track pageviews, but this approach is more complex and is [not supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigation) in all browsers.

> **Note:** This approach of manually capturing pageviews is no longer recommended. We recommend using `defaults: '2025-11-30'` or `capture_pageview: 'history_change'` instead, which automatically handles both `$pageview` and `$pageleave` events.
>
> If you're still capturing pageviews manually, you should also capture `$pageleave` events to track important engagement metrics like time on page (`$prev_pageview_duration`) and scroll depth (`$prev_pageview_max_scroll_percentage`). To do this, set up a listener on window unload (similar to [how PostHog does it](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/packages/browser/src/posthog-core.ts#L644-L646)):
>
> ```js
> useEffect(() => {
>   const handlePageLeave = () => {
>     posthog.capture('$pageleave', null, { transport: 'sendBeacon' })
>   }
>
>   // Use pagehide if available for better reliability, otherwise fallback to unload
>   const event = 'onpagehide' in window ? 'pagehide' : 'unload'
>   window.addEventListener(event, handlePageLeave)
>
>   return () => window.removeEventListener(event, handlePageLeave)
> }, [])
> ```
>
> Using `sendBeacon` ensures the event is sent even when users quickly close tabs. See our [time on page tutorial](/tutorials/time-on-page) for more details on using these metrics.

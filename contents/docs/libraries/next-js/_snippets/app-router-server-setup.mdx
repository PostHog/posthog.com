For the app router, we can initialize the `posthog-node` SDK once with a `PostHogClient` function, and import it into files.

This enables us to send events and fetch data from PostHog on the server â€“ without making client-side requests.

```js
// app/posthog.js
import { PostHog } from 'posthog-node'

export default function PostHogClient() {
  const posthogClient = new PostHog(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
    host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
    flushAt: 1,
    flushInterval: 0
  })
  return posthogClient
}
```

> **Note:** Because server-side functions in Next.js can be short-lived, we set `flushAt` to `1` and `flushInterval` to `0`. 
> - `flushAt` sets how many capture calls we should flush the queue (in one batch). 
> - `flushInterval` sets how many milliseconds we should wait before flushing the queue. 
> Setting them to the lowest number ensures events are sent immediately and not batched. We also need to call `await posthog.shutdown()` once done.

To use this client, we import it into our pages and call it with the `PostHogClient` function:

```js
import Link from 'next/link'
import PostHogClient from '../posthog'

export default async function About() {

  const posthog = PostHogClient()
  const flags = await posthog.getAllFlags(
    'user_distinct_id' // replace with a user's distinct ID
  );
  await posthog.shutdown()

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <Link href="/">Go home</Link>
      { flags['main-cta'] &&
        <Link href="http://posthog.com/">Go to PostHog</Link>
      }
    </main>
  )
}
```

```
Let's add PostHog to this project. We'll use the PostHog wizard to ensure the integration is handled correctly. Use this command:

npx --yes @posthog/wizard@latest --default --region <ph_region>

Do not generate any file changes yourself. This CLI command will do all the work. Wait for it to finish and test the setup once the wizard is complete.

```

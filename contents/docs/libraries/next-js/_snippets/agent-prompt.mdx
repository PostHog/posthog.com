Let's add PostHog to this project. We'll use the PostHog wizard to ensure the integration is handled correctly. Use this command:

<RegionCommand />

Do not generate any file changes yourself. This CLI command will do all the work. Wait for it to finish and test the setup once the wizard is complete.

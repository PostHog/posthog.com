In PostHog, you'll now have `$exception` events, which have a "Sentry URL" link to take you to the exception:

You can also monitor and manage these events in the [error tracking issue list](https://us.posthog.com/error_tracking).

From Sentry, you will now be able to go directly to the affected person in PostHog and watch the session recording for when the exception happened, see what else the user has done, and find their details. Don't forget to click the little icon to the side of the URL, not the URL itself.

When you start tracking events with PostHog, each user gets an anonymous ID that is used to identify them in the system.
In order to link this anonymous user with someone from your database, use the `identify` call. 

Identify lets you add metadata to your users so you can easily identify who they are in PostHog, as well as do things 
like segment users by these properties.

An identify call requires:

* `distinct_id` which uniquely identifies your user in your database
* `properties` with a dictionary of key:value pairs

For example:

```objectivec
// in objective-c
[[PHGPostHog sharedPostHog] identify:@"distinct_id_from_your_database"
                          properties:@{ @"name": @"Peter Griffin",
                                       @"email": @"peter@familyguy.com" }];
```

```swift
// in swift
posthog.identify("user_id_from_your_database", 
          properties: ["name": "Peter Griffin", "email": "peter@familyguy.com"])
```

The most obvious place to make this call is whenever a user signs up, or when they update their information.

When you call `identify`, all previously tracked anonymous events will be linked to the user.

Using `identify`, you can associate events with specific users. This enables you to gain full insights as to how they're using your product across different sessions, devices, and platforms.

An `identify` call has the following arguments:

* `distinct_id` which uniquely identifies your user in your database
- **userProperties:** Optional. A dictionary with key:value pairs to set the [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties)
- **userPropertiesSetOnce:** Optional. Similar to `userProperties`. [See the difference between `userProperties` and `userPropertiesSetOnce`](/docs/product-analytics/person-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once)

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.identify("user_id_from_your_database",
                            userProperties: ["name": "Peter Griffin", "email": "peter@familyguy.com"],
                            userPropertiesSetOnce: ["date_of_first_log_in": "2024-03-01"])
```

You should call `identify` as soon as you're able to. Typically, this is every time your app loads for the first time as well as directly after your user logs in. This ensures that events sent during your user's sessions are correctly associated with them.

When you call `identify`, all previously tracked anonymous events will be linked to the user.

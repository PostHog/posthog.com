import IOSInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-ios.mdx'
import IOSIdentify from './\_snippets/identify.mdx'
import IOSSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-ios.mdx'

This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

PostHog supports the following Apple platforms: 

- **iOS:** Version 13 or later
- **macOS:** Catalina (10.15) or later
- **tvOS:** Version 13 or later
- **watchOS:** Version 6 or later

## Installation

<IOSInstall />

## Capturing events

<IOSSendEvents />

## Preventing sensitive data capture

To exclude specific UI elements from autocapture or session replay, add `ph-no-capture` as either an `accessibilityLabel` or `accessibilityIdentifier`. When PostHog detects this label or identifier anywhere in the view hierarchy, the element will be either ignored or masked:

```swift
// This view will be excluded from autocapture
let view = UIView()
view.accessibilityLabel = "ph-no-capture"
```

> **Important:** By default, PostHog will make a best effort to automatically exclude fields detected as sensitive, even without the `ph-no-capture` tag. These include password fields, credit card fields, OTP fields, and any other fields related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

For more details on how to setup masking for session replay, please refer to our [Privacy Controls](/docs/session-replay/privacy?tab=iOS) documentation. 

## Identifying users

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

<IOSIdentify />

## Get the current user's distinct ID

You may find it helpful to get the current user's distinct ID. For example, to check whether you've already called `identify` for a user or not.

To do this, call `getDistinctId()`. This returns either the ID automatically generated by PostHog or the ID that has been passed by a call to `identify()`.

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend. 

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.alias("alias_id")
```

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Setting person properties

To set [properties](/docs/data/user-properties) on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `userProperties` and `userPropertiesSetOnce`.

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("signed_up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"], userProperties: ["user_property_name": "your_value"])
```

`userPropertiesSetOnce` works just like `userProperties`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("signed_up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"], userPropertiesSetOnce: ["user_property_name": "your_value"])
```

## Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a `$screen`, or anything else.

They are set using `PostHogSDK.shared.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.register(["team_id": 22])
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `team_id = 22`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `PostHogSDK.shared.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `PostHogSDK.shared.identify`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

### Removing stored Super Properties

Super Properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events, you can use `PostHogSDK.shared.unregister`, like so:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.unregister("team_id")
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply use `PostHogSDK.shared.reset` which takes care of clearing all stored Super Properties and more.

## Amending event properties before they are captured

In case you need to modify or process event properties before they are captured, cached, and sent to PostHog, you can use the `config.propertiesSanitizer` option. 

This feature allows you to define custom logic for sanitizing or transforming properties, ensuring that your event data meets your specific requirements before it is sent over the wire.

To implement this, define a custom sanitizer by creating a class or struct that conforms to the `PostHogPropertiesSanitizer` protocol and implement the `sanitize()` method. 

The `sanitize()` method receives a dictionary of event properties and should return a modified version of the dictionary. 

Then pass your custom sanitizer to `config.propertiesSanitizer` option.  

```swift
class ExampleSanitizer: PostHogPropertiesSanitizer {
    public func sanitize(_ properties: [String: Any]) -> [String: Any] {
        // Create a mutable copy
        var sanitizedProperties = properties
        // Perform sanitization
        // For example, removing keys with empty values
        for (key, value) in properties {
            if let stringValue = value as? String, stringValue.isEmpty {
                sanitizedProperties.removeValue(forKey: key)
            }
        }
        return sanitizedProperties
    }
}
```

## Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

```swift
configuration.flushAt = 1
```

You can also manually flush the queue:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("logged_out")
PostHogSDK.shared.flush()
```

## Reset after logout

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.reset()
```

## Opt out of data capture

You can completely opt-out users from data capture. To do this, there are two options:

1. Opt users out by default by setting `optOut` to `true` in your PostHog config:

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: <ph_project_api_key>, host: <ph_client_api_host>)
config.optOut = true
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
```

2. Opt users out on a per-person basis by calling `optOut()`:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.optOut()
```

Similarly, you can opt users in:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.optIn()
```

To check if a user is opted out:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.isOptOut()
```
 
## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.group(type: "company", key: "company_id_in_your_db")
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.group(type: "company", key: "company_id_in_your_db", groupProperties: [
    "name": "ACME Corp"
])
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Feature Flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import IOSFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-ios.mdx'

<IOSFeatureFlagsCode />

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```swift
if (PostHogSDK.shared.getFeatureFlag("experiment-feature-flag-key") as? String == "variant-name") {
    // do something
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## A note about IDFA (identifier for advertisers) collection in iOS 14

Starting with iOS 14, Apple will further restrict apps that track users. Any references to Apple's AdSupport framework, even in strings, [will trip](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/issues/6) the App Store's static analysis.

Hence **starting with posthog-ios version 1.2.0** we have removed all references to Apple's AdSupport framework.

## Session replay

To set up [session replay](/docs/session-replay/mobile) in your project, all you need to do is install the iOS SDK, enable "Record user sessions" in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay) and enable the `sessionReplay` option.

## All configuration options

The `configuration` element contains several other settings you can toggle:

```swift
/**
 * The number of queued events that the posthog client should flush at. Setting this to `1` will not queue
 * any events and will use more battery. `20` by default.
 */
configuration.flushAt = 20

/**
 * The amount of time to wait before each tick of the flush timer.
 * Smaller values will make events delivered in a more real-time manner and also use more battery.
 * A value smaller than 10 seconds will seriously degrade overall performance.
 * 30 seconds by default.
 */
configuration.flushIntervalSeconds = 30

/**
 * The maximum number of items to queue before starting to drop old ones. This should be a value greater
 * than zero, the behaviour is undefined otherwise. `1000` by default.
 */
configuration.maxQueueSize = 1000

/**
 * Number of maximum events in a batch call. (50 by default)
 */
configuration.maxBatchSize = 50

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically make a capture call for application lifecycle events,
 * such as "Application Installed", "Application Updated" and "Application Opened". (on/true by default)
 */
configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = true

/**
 * Whether the posthog client should automatically make a screen call when a view controller is added to
 * a view hierarchy. Because the underlying implementation uses method swizzling, we recommend initializing
 * the posthog client as early as possible (before any screens are displayed), ideally during the
 * Application delegate's applicationDidFinishLaunching method. (on/true by default)
 */
configuration.captureScreenViews = true

/**
* Whether the posthog client should automatically make a capture call when the user interacts with an element in a screen.
* 
* Experimental support (UIKit)
* Defaults to false
*/
configuration.captureElementInteractions = false

/**
 * Send a `$feature_flag_called` event when a feature flag is used automatically. (on/true by default)
 */
configuration.sendFeatureFlagEvent = true

/**
 * Preload feature flags automatically. (on/true by default)
 */
configuration.preloadFeatureFlags = true

/**
 * Logs the SDK messages into Logcat. (off/false by default)
 */
configuration.debug = false

/**
 * Prevents capturing any data if enabled. (off/false by default)
 */
configuration.optOut = false

/**
 * Callback that allows to sanitize the event properties (not set by default)
 */
configuration.propertiesSanitizer = { ... }

/**
 * Hook that allows for modification of the default mechanism for
 * generating anonymous id (which as of now is just random UUID v7)
 */
configuration.getAnonymousId = { ... }

/**
 * Allows to send your data only if the data mode matches your configuration
 * such as wifi only, cellular only or any.
 * Defaults to .any
 */
configuration.dataMode = .any

/**
 * Determines the behavior for processing user profiles.
 * Defaults to .identifiedOnly
 */
configuration.personProfiles = .identifiedOnly

/**
 * Enable Recording of Session Replays. (off/false by default)
 */
configuration.sessionReplay = false

/**
 * Session Replay configuration
 */
configuration.sessionReplayConfig = .init()

/**
* The identifier of the App Group that should be used to store shared analytics data. 
* PostHog will try to get the physical location of the App Group’s shared container, otherwise fallback to the default location
*/
configuration.appGroupIdentifier = nil
```

import IOSInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-ios.mdx'
import IOSIdentify from './_snippets/identify.mdx'
import IOSSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-ios.mdx'

This library uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your mobile app.

PostHog supports the following Apple platforms: 

- **iOS:** Version 13 or later
- **macOS:** Catalina (10.15) or later
- **tvOS:** Version 13 or later
- **watchOS:** Version 6 or later
- **visionOS:** Version 1 or later

## Installation

<IOSInstall />

## Capturing events

<IOSSendEvents />

## Preventing sensitive data capture

To exclude specific UI elements from autocapture or session replay, add `ph-no-capture` as either an `accessibilityLabel` or `accessibilityIdentifier`. When PostHog detects this label or identifier anywhere in the view hierarchy, the element will be either ignored or masked:

```swift
// This view will be excluded from autocapture
let view = UIView()
view.accessibilityLabel = "ph-no-capture"
```

> **Important:** By default, PostHog will make a best effort to automatically exclude fields detected as sensitive, even without the `ph-no-capture` tag. These include password fields, credit card fields, OTP fields, and any other fields related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

For more details on how to setup masking for session replay, please refer to our [Privacy Controls](/docs/session-replay/privacy?tab=iOS) documentation.

## Identifying users

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

<IOSIdentify />

## Get the current user's distinct ID

You may find it helpful to get the current user's distinct ID. For example, to check whether you've already called `identify` for a user or not.

To do this, call `getDistinctId()`. This returns either the ID automatically generated by PostHog or the ID that has been passed by a call to `identify()`.

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend. 

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.alias("alias_id")
```

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Setting person properties

To set [properties](/docs/data/user-properties) on your users via an event, you can leverage the event properties `userProperties` and `userPropertiesSetOnce`.

When capturing an event, you can pass a property called `$set` as an event property, and specify its value to be an object with properties to be set on the user that will be associated with the user who triggered the event.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("signed_up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"], userProperties: ["user_property_name": "your_value"])
```

`userPropertiesSetOnce` works just like `userProperties`, except that it will **only set the property if the user doesn't already have that property set**.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("signed_up", properties: ["plan": "Pro++"], userPropertiesSetOnce: ["user_property_name": "your_value"])
```

## Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a `$screen`, or anything else.

They are set using `PostHogSDK.shared.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.register(["team_id": 22])
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `team_id = 22`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `PostHogSDK.shared.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `PostHogSDK.shared.identify`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

### Removing stored Super Properties

Super Properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events, you can use `PostHogSDK.shared.unregister`, like so:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.unregister("team_id")
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply use `PostHogSDK.shared.reset` which takes care of clearing all stored Super Properties and more.

## Amending, dropping or sampling events

Since version 3.28.0, you can provide a `BeforeSendBlock` function when initializing the SDK to amend, drop or sample events before they are sent to PostHog. 

> **⚠️ Note:** This replaces the deprecated `propertiesSanitizer` option and provides more flexibility in modifying events. You can achieve the same functionality as `propertiesSanitizer` by using a `BeforeSendBlock` that mutates the event's properties in place. 

> **🚨 Warning:** Amending and sampling events is advanced functionality that requires careful implementation. Core PostHog features may require 100% of unmodified events to function properly. We recommend only modifying or sampling your own custom events if possible, and preserving all PostHog internal events in their original form.

### Redacting information in events

`BeforeSendBlock` gives you one place to edit or redact information before it is sent to PostHog. For example:

<details>
<summary>Redact URLs in event properties</summary>

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_api_client_host>")

config.setBeforeSend { event in
    // Redact URLs
    if let url = event.properties["url"] as? String {
        event.properties["url"] = url.map { _ in "*" }.joined()
    }
    return event
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Redact sensitive information from event properties</summary>

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_api_client_host>")

config.setBeforeSend { event in
    // Redact sensitive information
    if let email = event.properties["email"] as? String {
        event.properties["email"] = email.map { _ in "*" }.joined()
    }
    
    return event
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Drop events by event name</summary>

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_api_client_host>")

config.setBeforeSend { event in
    // Drop all events named "Stale Event"
    if event.event == "Stale Event" {
        return nil
    }
    return event
}
```

</details>

### Sampling events

Sampling lets you choose to send only a percentage of events to PostHog. It is a good way to control your costs without having to completely turn off features of the SDK.

<details>
<summary>Sample events by event name</summary>

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_api_client_host>")

config.setBeforeSend { event in
    // Sample 10% of Sampled Event events
    if event.event == "Sampled Event" {
        if Double.random(in: 0...1) < 0.1 {
            event.properties["$sample_type"] = ["sampleByEvent"]
            event.properties["$sample_threshold"] = 0.1
            event.properties["$sampled_events"] = ["Sampled Event"]
            return event
        }
        return nil
    }
    return event
}
```

</details>

### Chaining multiple BeforeSendBlocks

You can provide an array of `BeforeSendBlock` functions to be called one after the other:

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_api_client_host>")

config.setBeforeSend(
    // First block: Drop all events named "Stale Event"
    { event in
        if event.event == "Stale Event" {
            return nil
        }
        return event
    },
    // Second block: Redact sensitive information
    { event in
        if let email = event.properties["email"] as? String {
            event.properties["email"] = email.map { _ in "*" }.joined()
        }
        return event
    }
)
```

**Note:** When chaining beforeSend blocks, order is important. The first block is executed first and the mutated event is passed along to the second block, and so on. If at any point in the chain the event is dropped, any subsequent blocks will not be executed.

## Flush

You can set the number of events in the configuration that should queue before flushing.
Setting this to `1` will send events immediately and will use more battery. This is set to `20` by default.

```swift
configuration.flushAt = 1
```

You can also manually flush the queue:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("logged_out")
PostHogSDK.shared.flush()
```

## Offline behavior

The PostHog iOS SDK will continue to capture events when the device is offline. The events are stored in a queue in the device's file storage and are flushed when the device is online.

- The queue has a maximum size defined by `maxQueueSize` in the configuration.
- When the queue is full, the oldest event is deleted first.
- The queue is flushed only when the device is online.

## Reset after logout

To reset the user's ID and anonymous ID, call `reset`. Usually you would do this right after the user logs out.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.reset()
```

## Opt out of data capture

You can completely opt-out users from data capture. To do this, there are two options:

1. Opt users out by default by setting `optOut` to `true` in your PostHog config:

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_client_api_host>")
config.optOut = true
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
```

2. Opt users out on a per-person basis by calling `optOut()`:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.optOut()
```

Similarly, you can opt users in:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.optIn()
```

To check if a user is opted out:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.isOptOut()
```
 
## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.group(type: "company", key: "company_id_in_your_db")
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.group(type: "company", key: "company_id_in_your_db", groupProperties: [
    "name": "ACME Corp"
])
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Feature Flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import IOSFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-ios.mdx'

<IOSFeatureFlagsCode />

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```swift
if (PostHogSDK.shared.getFeatureFlag("experiment-feature-flag-key") as? String == "variant-name") {
    // do something
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## A note about IDFA (identifier for advertisers) collection in iOS 14

Starting with iOS 14, Apple will further restrict apps that track users. Any references to Apple's AdSupport framework, even in strings, [will trip](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/issues/6) the App Store's static analysis.

Hence **starting with posthog-ios version 1.2.0** we have removed all references to Apple's AdSupport framework.

## Session replay

> **Note:** Session replay is currently only available on iOS. For future macOS support, please follow and upvote [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/issues/200).

To set up [session replay](/docs/session-replay/mobile) in your project, all you need to do is install the iOS SDK, enable "Record user sessions" in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay) and enable the `sessionReplay` option.

## Surveys

[Surveys](/docs/surveys) launched with [popover presentation](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#presentation) are automatically shown to users matching the [display conditions](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#display-conditions) you set up.

## Method swizzling

The PostHog iOS SDK uses method swizzling to intercept and modify method calls at runtime to provide advanced features like:

- **Screen view tracking** - Automatically captures when view controllers are presented (`config.captureScreenViews`)
- **Element interactions** - Automatically tracks user interactions with UI elements (`config.captureElementInteractions`)  
- **Session replay** - Records user sessions (`config.sessionReplay`)
- **Surveys** - Displays surveys at appropriate times (`config.surveys`)
- **Advanced session end detection** - Detects when a user's session ends based on their activity in the app 

### Disabling method swizzling

Since version 3.34.0, you can opt in or out of swizzling using the `enableSwizzling` configuration option. When you disable swizzling, the SDK disables the features listed above. 

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_api_client_host>")
config.enableSwizzling = false
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
```

> **Note:** When method swizzling is disabled, features that depend on it will not work even if they are individually enabled in the config. For example, if you set `config.sessionReplay = true` and `config.enableSwizzling = false`, session replay will **not** be enabled. 

## All configuration options

The `configuration` element contains several other settings you can toggle:

```swift
/**
 * The number of queued events that the posthog client should flush at. Setting this to `1` will not queue
 * any events and will use more battery. `20` by default.
 */
configuration.flushAt = 20

PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your Shopify store. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, A/B testing, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Shopify store using a manual implementation. 

> **Third-party solutions**
> There are several unofficial, third-party Shopify x PostHog integrations, such as [PixieHog](https://pixiehog.com/). Some users find success with these integrations, but we're unable to provide support for them as they are created and run by third-party teams. Instead, we recommend following the guide below as a first step. 

## Installing PostHog manually into the theme

![Shopify Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/tutorials/shopify/shopify-dashboard.png)

1. You should now be seeing a code editor. Click on `theme.liquid` under 'Layout' on the left sidebar
1. Navigate until you see the closing `</head>` tag. Paste your snippet there, before that tag:

![Shopify Snippet](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/tutorials/shopify/snippet.png)

3. Click the green save button on the top right and you're good to go - PostHog should now be capturing events on your Shopify store!

> To confirm PostHog is configured correctly, visit your store and then check if the events from your session appear in the [PostHog activity tab](https://us.posthog.com/events). This may take a few minutes.


### Enabling heatmap

The heatmap won't work on Shopify out of the box because Shopify has very strict CSP headers, particularly `frame-ancestors`.

You can bypass this issue and enable the heatmap by running a Cloudflare worker that rewrites the `frame-ancestors` header. We recommend using a separate subdomain like `heatmap.myshop.com` from your production site to minimize impact. Here is a simple Cloudflare worker that updates this header:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const response = await fetch(request);
    const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);

    newResponse.headers.set(
      'Content-Security-Policy',
      "frame-ancestors 'self' *.posthog.com"
    );

    return newResponse;
  }
};
```

### Enabling toolbar

If you're having trouble viewing the PostHog toolbar, ensure your Shopify theme is not hiding empty `div`s.

```css
a:empty,
ul:empty,
dl:empty,
/* div:empty, -- Make sure this rule is turned off! */
section:empty,
article:empty,
p:empty,
h1:empty,
h2:empty,
h3:empty,
h4:empty,
h5:empty,
h6:empty {
  display: none;
}
```

### Tracking conversions

Shopify's checkout flow doesn't allow arbitrary JavaScript to be run, so the PostHog JavaScript snippet cannot be used directly on the checkout page or post-purchase page. However, you can still track conversions by using a [custom web pixel](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api#custom-web-pixels).

#### Setting up a custom web pixel

To set this up, first, go to the [customer events](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/customer_events) tab in your store settings, click "Add custom pixel," and give your pixel a name.

Next, add code that contains:

1. The customer events you want to subscribe to. You can find a complete list in Shopify's [Web Pixels API documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events).

2. Your PostHog JavaScript snippet which you can get from [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project#snippet).

3. The rest of your PostHog capture logic. 

As an example, here is the code for subscribing to a `checkout_completed` event. Every time a user checks out, we capture an event. We also call [`posthog.identify()`](/docs/product-analytics/identify) so that we can track the user across different sessions:

```js
analytics.subscribe("checkout_completed", (event) => {
  !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.crossOrigin="anonymous",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="capture identify alias people.set people.set_once set_config register register_once unregister opt_out_capturing has_opted_out_capturing opt_in_capturing reset isFeatureEnabled onFeatureFlags getFeatureFlag getFeatureFlagPayload reloadFeatureFlags group updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment getEarlyAccessFeatures getActiveMatchingSurveys getSurveys getNextSurveyStep onSessionId".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);
  posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', { api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>', defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>' })

  const checkout = event.data.checkout;

  posthog.identify(checkout.email, {
      email: checkout.email,
      first_name: checkout.billingAddress.firstName,
      last_name:  checkout.billingAddress.lastName,
    }
  )
  posthog.capture('merch store order submitted', {
    value: checkout.totalPrice.amount,
    currency: checkout.totalPrice.currencyCode,
    created_at: event.timestamp,
    order_number: checkout.order.id,
    userId: event.clientId,
    order_id: checkout.order.id,
    products: checkout.lineItems.map((item) => {
      return {
        product_id: item.id,
        title: item.variant.product.title,
        quantity: item.quantity,
        price: item.variant.price.amount,
        currency: item.variant.price.currencyCode,
        sku: item.variant.sku,
        size: item.variant.product.size
      };
    }),
  })
});
```

In the above code, we capture the event with details like `userID`, `order_number`, and the product array with `product_id`, `price`, and more. This is then viewable in PostHog:

<ProductScreenshot 
  imageLight={eventLight} 
  imageDark={eventDark} 
  alt="Shopify events in PostHog" 
/>

We recommend _only_ using a Shopify pixel for tracking conversions. If using a pixel for other events (like `collection_viewed` or `product_viewed`), you may see CORS errors when viewing those webpages. While it doesn't affect the functionality of the pixel, everything else can be done using PostHog installed globally on your site.

#### Tracking items added to the cart

To track _which_ product a user adds to their cart, we can use a `data-ph-capture-attribute` on the 'Add to cart' button (generally in `product.liquid` in Shopify). While this still requires adding code, it's less involved than creating a custom event. For example, capturing the product title and price (divided by 100) looks like this:

```html
<input type="submit" class="add-to-cart-button" value="{{ 'products.product.add_to_cart' | t }}" 
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-name="{{product.title}}" 
    data-ph-capture-attribute-product-price="{{product.price | divided_by: 100 }}"
/>
```

Once set up, the _Add to cart_ button autocapture event in PostHog will include the properties for each of the attributes prefixed with `data-ph-capture-attribute-` and their values.

## What can you do with this data?

You can use this data to answer questions like:

- Which products are being _left in the cart_ most often?
- Which products are being _purchased together_ most often?
- Which marketing campaigns are driving sales of different products?
- How does regionality of shoppers affect the products they buy?

<CalloutBox icon="IconWarning" title="Don't directly import PostHog" type="caution">

When using React Router, you should not directly import `posthog` from `posthog-js` other than during initialization. Instead, use the `usePostHog` hook to access the PostHog client to ensure PostHog is initialized before use.

At this point, you should be able to capture client-side events and see them in your PostHog project. This includes basic events like page views and button clicks that are [autocaptured](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture).

You can also try to capture a custom event to verify it's working. You can access PostHog in any component using the `usePostHog` hook.

```tsx
import { usePostHog } from '@posthog/react'

function App() {
  const posthog = usePostHog()
  return <button onClick={() => posthog?.capture('button_clicked')}>Click me</button>
}
```

You should see these events in a minute or two in the [activity tab](https://app.posthog.com/activity/explore).

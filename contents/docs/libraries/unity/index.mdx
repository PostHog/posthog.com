> **Note:** This SDK is currently in **beta**. Please report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-unity/issues).

This is the official PostHog SDK for Unity. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your Unity game or application.

PostHog Unity SDK supports Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and WebGL platforms.

## Installation

import UnityInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-unity.mdx'

<UnityInstall />

## Capturing events

import UnitySendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-unity.mdx'

<UnitySendEvents />

## Identifying users

> We highly recommend reading our section on [Identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

When a user logs in, you can associate their events with their identity by calling `IdentifyAsync`:

```csharp
using PostHog;
using System.Collections.Generic;

await PostHog.IdentifyAsync("user_123", new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "email", "user@example.com" },
    { "name", "Max Hedgehog" },
    { "plan", "premium" }
});
```

### Reset on logout

When a user logs out, call `ResetAsync` to clear the current user's identity and generate a new anonymous distinct ID:

```csharp
await PostHog.ResetAsync();
```

## Anonymous vs identified events

import IdentifiedVsAnonymousIntro from '../../product-analytics/_snippets/identified-vs-anonymous-intro.mdx'

<IdentifiedVsAnonymousIntro />

### Controlling person profiles

By default, the SDK captures identified events. To control whether events create person profiles, configure `PersonProfiles` during initialization:

```csharp
PostHog.Setup(new PostHogConfig
{
    ApiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>",
    Host = "<ph_client_api_host>",
    PersonProfiles = PersonProfiles.IdentifiedOnly // Only create profiles on identify
});
```

Available options:
- `PersonProfiles.IdentifiedOnly` (default) - Only creates person profiles when `Identify` is called
- `PersonProfiles.Always` - Creates person profiles for all events
- `PersonProfiles.Never` - Never creates person profiles (anonymous events only)

## Super properties

Super properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `Capture` call.

They are set using `Register`, which takes a key and value, and they persist across sessions.

```csharp
// Register a super property
PostHog.Register("app_version", "1.2.3");
PostHog.Register("platform", "iOS");
```

This ensures that every event sent by the user will include these properties.

### Removing super properties

Super properties are persisted across sessions so you have to explicitly remove them if they are no longer relevant:

```csharp
PostHog.Unregister("app_version");
```

If you are doing this as part of a user logging out you can instead simply use `PostHog.ResetAsync()` which takes care of clearing all stored super properties and more.

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note:** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more on the [pricing page](/pricing).

- Associate events with a group:

```csharp
PostHog.Group("company", "company_id_in_your_db");
```

- Associate events with a group AND update group properties:

```csharp
PostHog.Group("company", "company_id_in_your_db", new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "name", "Acme Inc" },
    { "plan", "enterprise" },
    { "employees", 100 }
});
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import UnityFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-unity.mdx'

<UnityFeatureFlagsCode />

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```csharp
var flag = PostHog.GetFeatureFlag("experiment-feature-flag-key");
if (flag.GetVariant("control") == "variant-name")
{
    // Do something for this variant
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Error tracking

The Unity SDK automatically captures unhandled exceptions and sends them to PostHog. This is enabled by default.

### Manual exception capture

For handled exceptions that you want to report:

```csharp
try
{
    // Risky operation
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    PostHog.CaptureException(e);
    // Handle the error gracefully
}

// With additional properties
PostHog.CaptureException(e, new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "context", "checkout_flow" },
    { "item_count", 5 }
});
```

### Configuration

```csharp
PostHog.Setup(new PostHogConfig
{
    ApiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>",

    // Exception tracking options
    CaptureExceptions = true,              // Enable automatic capture (default: true)
    ExceptionDebounceIntervalMs = 1000,    // Min ms between captures (default: 1000)
    CaptureExceptionsInEditor = true       // Capture in Unity Editor (default: true)
});
```

### Disabling error tracking

```csharp
PostHog.Setup(new PostHogConfig
{
    ApiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>",
    CaptureExceptions = false  // Disable automatic exception capture
});
```

## Application lifecycle events

When `CaptureApplicationLifecycleEvents` is enabled (default: `true`), these events are captured automatically:

- `Application Installed` - First launch
- `Application Updated` - Version changed
- `Application Opened` - App foregrounded
- `Application Backgrounded` - App backgrounded

## Opt out of data capture

For GDPR compliance, you can disable data collection at any time:

```csharp
// Opt out (stops all tracking, clears queue)
PostHog.OptOut();

// Opt back in
PostHog.OptIn();

// Check status
if (PostHog.IsOptedOut)
{
    // Show consent dialog
}
```

## Debug mode

If you're not seeing the expected events being captured or feature flags being evaluated, enable debug mode to see what's happening:

```csharp
PostHog.Setup(new PostHogConfig
{
    ApiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>",
    Host = "<ph_client_api_host>",
    LogLevel = PostHogLogLevel.Debug
});
```

Available log levels: `None`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Debug`

## Manual flush

Force send all queued events immediately:

```csharp
PostHog.Flush();
```

## Shutdown

Clean up when your app exits:

```csharp
void OnApplicationQuit()
{
    PostHog.Shutdown();
}
```

> **Note:** The SDK automatically flushes on app quit, so explicit shutdown is optional.

## Platform support

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| Windows/Mac/Linux | Full |
| iOS | Full |
| Android | Full |
| WebGL | With limitations* |
| Consoles | Untested |

*WebGL uses PlayerPrefs for storage (limited size) and is subject to CORS restrictions.

## Troubleshooting

### Events not appearing in PostHog

1. Check your API key is correct
2. Verify the host URL matches your PostHog instance (e.g., `https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`)
3. Set `LogLevel = PostHogLogLevel.Debug` to see detailed logs
4. Ensure you're not opted out (`PostHog.IsOptedOut`)

### WebGL issues

- Ensure your PostHog instance allows CORS from your domain
- WebGL has limited storage - consider reducing `MaxQueueSize`

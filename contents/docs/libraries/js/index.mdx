> **Note:** This doc refers to our [posthog-js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js) library for use on the browser. For server-side JavaScript, see our [Node SDK](/docs/libraries/node).

## Installation

import JSInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-web.mdx'

<JSInstall />

### Track across marketing website &amp; app

We recommend putting PostHog both on your homepage and your application if applicable. That means you'll be able to follow a user from the moment they come onto your website, all the way through signup and actually using your product.

> PostHog automatically sets a cross-domain cookie, so if your website is `yourapp.com` and your app is on `app.yourapp.com` users will be followed when they go from one to the other.

### Permitted domains

You can also configure "permitted domains" in your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings). These are domains where you'll be able to record user sessions and use the PostHog toolbar.

## Capturing events

import WebSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-web.mdx'

<WebSendEvents />

## Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include them when capturing an event:

```js-web
posthog.capture(
  'event_name', 
  { 
    $set: { name: 'Max Hedgehog'  },
    $set_once: { initial_url: '/blog' },
  }
)
```

Typically user properties are set when an event occurs like `user updated email` but there may be occasions where you simply want to set user properties as its own event. 

```javascript
posthog.setPersonProperties(
    { name: "Max Hedgehog" } // Thes properties are like the `$set` from above 
    { initial_url: "/blog" } // Thes properties are like the `$set` from above 
)
```

This creates a special `$set` event that is sent to PostHog.

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

## Identifying users

> We strongly recommend reading our docs on [identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users) to better understand how to correctly use this method.

import JSIdentify from './\_snippets/identify.mdx'

<JSIdentify />


## Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Reset after logout

If a user logs out, you should call `reset` to unlink any future events made on that device with that user. 

This is important if your users are sharing a computer, as otherwise all of those users are grouped together into a single user due to shared cookies between sessions. **We strongly recommend you call `reset` on logout even if you don't expect users to share a computer.**

You can do that like so:

```js-web
posthog.reset()
```

If you _also_ want to reset `device_id`, you can pass `true` as a parameter:

```js-web
posthog.reset(true)
```

## Super Properties

Super Properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call, be it a $pageview, an autocaptured button click, or anything else.

They are set using `posthog.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter, and they persist across sessions.

For example, take a look at the following call:

```js-web
posthog.register({
    'icecream pref': 'vanilla',
    team_id: 22,
})
```

The call above ensures that every event sent by the user will include `"icecream pref": "vanilla"` and `"team_id": 22`. This way, if you filtered events by property using `icecream_pref = vanilla`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `posthog.register` call, since they all include the specified Super Property.

However, please note that this does not store properties against the User, only against their events. To store properties against the User object, you should use `posthog.setPersonProperties`. More information on this can be found on the [Sending User Information section](#sending-user-information).

Furthermore, if you register the same property multiple times, the next event will use the new value of that property. If you want to register a property only once (e.g. for ad campaign properties) you can use `register_once`, like so:

```js-web
posthog.register_once({
    'campaign source': 'twitter',
})
```

Using `register_once` will ensure that if a property is already set, it will not be set again. For example, if the user already has property `"icecream pref": "vanilla"`, calling `posthog.register_once({"icecream pref": "chocolate"})` will **not** update the property.

### Removing stored Super Properties

Setting Super Properties creates a cookie on the client with the respective properties and their values. In order to stop sending a Super Property with events and remove the cookie, you can use `posthog.unregister`, like so:

```js-web
posthog.unregister('icecream pref')
```

This will remove the Super Property and subsequent events will not include it.

## Opt users out

PostHog JS offers a function to opt users out based on your cookie settings definition (e.g. preferences set via a cookie banner).

This is also the suggested way to prevent capturing _any data_ from the admin on the page, as well as from team members of your organization. A simple way to do this is to access the page as the admin (or any other user on your team you wish to stop capturing data on), and call `posthog.opt_out_capturing();` on the developer console. You can also add this logic in you app and call it directly after an admin/team member logs in.

If you still wish to capture these events but want to create a distinction between users and team in PostHog, you should look into [Cohorts](/docs/user-guides/cohorts#differentiating-team-vs-users-traffic).

With PostHog, you can:

Opt a user out:

```js-web
posthog.opt_out_capturing()
```

See if a user has opted out:

```js-web
posthog.has_opted_out_capturing()
```

Opt a user back in:

```js-web
posthog.opt_in_capturing()
```

## Feature Flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import WebFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-web.mdx'

<WebFeatureFlagsCode />

### Bootstrapping Flags

import BootstrappingIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/bootstrapping-intro.mdx"

<BootstrappingIntro />

For details on how to implement bootstrapping, see our [bootstrapping guide](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping).

### Overriding server properties

Sometimes, you might want to evaluate feature flags using properties that haven't been ingested yet, or were set incorrectly earlier. You can do so by setting properties the flag depends on with these calls:

```js-web
posthog.setPersonPropertiesForFlags({'property1': 'value', property2: 'value2'})
```

Note that these are set for the entire session. Successive calls are additive: all properties you set are combined together and sent for flag evaluation.

Whenever you set these properties, we also trigger a reload of feature flags to ensure we have the latest values. You can disable this by passing in the optional parameter for reloading:

```js-web
posthog.setPersonPropertiesForFlags({'property1': 'value', property2: 'value2'}, false)
```

At any point, you can reset these properties by calling `resetPersonPropertiesForFlags`:

```js-web
posthog.resetPersonPropertiesForFlags()
```

The same holds for [group](/manual/group-analytics) properties:

```js-web
// set properties for a group
posthog.setGroupPropertiesForFlags({'company': {'property1': 'value', property2: 'value2'}})

// reset properties for a given group:
posthog.resetGroupPropertiesForFlags('company')

// reset properties for all groups:
posthog.resetGroupPropertiesForFlags()
```
> **Note:** You don't need to add the group names here, since these properties are automatically attached to the current group (set via `posthog.group()`). When you change the group, these properties are reset.

**Automatic overrides**

Whenever you call `posthog.identify` with person properties, we automatically add these properties to flag evaluation calls to help determine the correct flag values. The same is true for when you call `posthog.group()`.

**Default overridden properties**

By default, we always override some properties based on the user IP address.

The list of properties that this overrides:

1. $geoip_city_name
2. $geoip_country_name
3. $geoip_country_code
4. $geoip_continent_name
5. $geoip_continent_code
6. $geoip_postal_code
7. $geoip_time_zone

This enables any geolocation-based flags to work without manually setting these properties.

#### Enriched analytics

You can send enriched analytics data for feature flags, which helps uncover replays where people interact with a flag, target people who've interacted with a feature, or build cohorts of people who've viewed a feature.

To enable this, you can either use our `<PosthogFeature>` [React component](/docs/libraries/react#feature-flags-react-component) (which implements this for you), or implement it on your own if you're not using react.

To implement it on your own, there are 3 things you need to do:

1. Whenever a feature is viewed, send the `$feature_view` event with the property `feature_flag` set to the name of the flag.

```javascript
posthog.capture('$feature_view', { feature_flag: flag })
```
2. Whenever someone interacts with a feature, send the `$feature_interaction` event with the property `feature_flag` set to the name of the flag.
3. At the same time, set the person property `$feature_interaction/<flag-key>` to true. [Here's a code example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/master/react/src/components/PostHogFeature.tsx#L48C10-L48C35).

```javascript
posthog.capture('$feature_interaction', { feature_flag: flag, $set: { [`$feature_interaction/${flag}`]: true } })
```

[Here's a code example for the entire React component](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/master/react/src/components/PostHogFeature.tsx).

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```js-web
// Ensure flags are loaded before usage.
// You'll only need to call this on the code the first time a user visits.
// See this doc for more details: https://posthog.com/docs/feature-flags/manual#ensuring-flags-are-loaded-before-usage
posthog.onFeatureFlags(function() {
    // feature flags should be available at this point
    if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key')  == 'variant-name') {
        // do something
    }
})

// Otherwise, you can just do:
if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key')  == 'variant-name') {
    // do something
}

// You can also test your code by overriding the feature flag:
// e.g., posthog.featureFlags.override({'experiment-feature-flag-key': 'test'})
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Early access feature management

Early access features give you the option to release feature flags that can be controlled by your users. More information on this can be found [here](/docs/feature-flags/early-access-feature-management).

```js-web
posthog.getEarlyAccessFeatures((previewItemData) => {
    // do something with early access feature
})
```

```js-web
posthog.updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment(flagKey, 'true')
```

## Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Associate the events for this session with a group

```js-web
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db')

posthog.capture('upgraded_plan') // this event is associated with company ID `company_id_in_your_db`
```

-   Associate the events for this session with a group AND update the properties of that group

```js-web
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db', {
    name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    employees: 11,
})
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

#### Handling logging out

When the user logs out it's important to call `posthog.reset()` to avoid new events being registered under the previously active group.

#### Integrating groups with feature flags

If you have updated tracking, you can use group-based feature flags as normal.

```js-web
if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature')) {
    // do something
}
```

To check flag status for a different group, first switch the active group by calling `posthog.group()`.

## Surveys

[Surveys](/docs/surveys) launched with [popover presentation](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#presentation) are automatically shown to users matching the [targeting](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#targeting) you set up.

Surveys using the **API** presentation enable you to implement your own survey UI and use PostHog to handle display logic, capturing results, and analytics.

To implement **API** surveys, start by fetching active surveys for a user using either of the methods below:

```js-web
// Fetch enabled surveys for the current user
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys(callback, forceReload) 

// Fetch all surveys
posthog.getSurveys(callback, forceReload)
```

The response returns an array of survey objects and is cached by default. To force a reload, pass `true` as the `forceReload` argument.

The survey objects look like this:

```json
[{
  "id": "your_survey_id",
  "name": "Your survey name",
  "description": "Metadata describing your survey",
  "type": "api", // either "api", "popover", or "widget"
  "linked_flag_key": null, // linked feature flag key, if any.
  "targeting_flag_key": "your_survey_targeting_flag_key",
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "single_choice",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "question": "Are you enjoying PostHog?"
    }
  ],
  "conditions": null,
  "start_date": "2023-09-19T13:10:49.505000Z",
  "end_date": null
}]
```

### Capturing survey events

To display survey results in PostHog, you need to capture 3 types of events:

```js-web
// 1. When a user is shown a survey
posthog.capture("survey shown", {
    $survey_id: survey.id // required
})

// 2. When a user has dismissed a survey
posthog.capture("survey dismissed", {
    $survey_id: survey.id // required
})

// 3. When a user has responded to a survey
posthog.capture("survey sent", {
    $survey_id: survey.id, // required
    $survey_response: survey_response // required. `survey_response` must be a text or number value (depending on your question type).
    // For multiple choice select surveys, `survey_response` must be in an array of values with the selected choices.
    // e.g., $survey_response: ["response_1", 8, "response_2"]
})
```

## Persistence

In order for PostHog to work optimally, we require storing a small amount of information about the user on the user's browser. This ensures that if the user navigates away, and comes back to your site at a later time, we will still identify them properly. We store the following information in the user's browser:

-   User's ID
-   Session ID & Device ID
-   Active & enabled feature flags
-   Any super properties you have defined.
-   Some PostHog configuration options (e.g. whether session recording is enabled)

By default we store all this information in a `cookie`, which means that PostHog will still be able to identify your users even across subdomains. By default, this cookie is set to expire after `365` days.

If you would like to change how PostHog stores this information, you can do so with the `persistence` parameter.

-   `persistence: "cookie"` (default). Everything is stored in a cookie.
-   `persistence: "localStorage+cookie"`. User's distinct ID is stored in a cookie and everything else is stored in the browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a>.
-   `persistence: "localStorage"`. Everything is stored in localStorage.
-   `persistence: "sessionStorage"`. Everything is stored in sessionStorage.
-   `persistence: "memory"`. Stores in page memory, which means data is only persisted for the duration of the page view.

As a note, due to the size limitation of cookies you may run into `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` errors (e.g. if you have a lot of feature flags). In that case, use `localStorage+cookie`.

> **Note: ** Please be aware that localStorage and sessionStorage can't be used across subdomains. If you have multiple sites on the same domain, you may want to consider the <code>cookie</code> option or make sure to set all super properties across each subdomain.

If you don't want PostHog to store anything on the user's browser (e.g. if you want to rely on your own identification mechanism only, or want completely anonymous users), you can set `disable_persistence: true` in PostHog's config.
**Warning:** Remember to call `posthog.identify` every time your app loads or every page refresh will be treated as a different user.

## Config

When calling `posthog.init`, there are various configuration options you can set in addition to `loaded` and `api_host`.

To configure these options, pass them as an object to the `posthog.init` call, like so:

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    loaded: function (posthog) {
        posthog.identify('[user unique id]')
    },
    autocapture: false,
    // ... more options
})
```

There are multiple different configuration options, most of which you do not have to ever worry about. For brevity, only the most relevant ones are used here. However you can view all the configuration options in [posthog-core.js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/96fa9339b9c553a1c69ec5db9d282f31a65a1c25/src/posthog-core.js#L933).

Some of the most relevant options are:

### Advanced configuration

In this section we describe some additional details on advanced configuration available.

| Attribute                                                                     | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `advanced_disable_decide`<br/><br/>**Type:** Boolean<br/>**Default:** `false` | Will completely disable the `/decide` endpoint request (and features that rely on it). More details below.     |
| `advanced_disable_feature_flags`<br/><br/>**Type:** Boolean<br/>**Default:** `false` | Will keep `/decide` running, but without any feature flag requests     |
| `advanced_disable_feature_flags_on_first_load`<br/><br/>**Type:** Boolean<br/>**Default:** `false` | Stops from firing feature flag requests on first page load. Only requests feature flags when user identity or properties are updated, or you manually request for flags to be loaded.  |
| `secure_cookie` <br/><br/>**Type:** Boolean<br/>**Default:** `false`          | If this is `true`, PostHog cookies will be marked as secure, meaning they will only be transmitted over HTTPS. |
| `custom_campaign_params` <br/><br/>**Type:** Array<br/>**Default:** `[]`      | List of query params to be automatically captured (see [UTM Segmentation](/docs/data/utm-segmentation) ) |

### Disable `/decide` endpoint

<blockquote>
    This feature was introduced in posthog-js 1.10.0. Previously, disabling autocapture would inherently disable the
    /decide endpoint altogether. This meant that disabling autocapture would inadvertenly turn off session recording,
    feature flags, compression and the toolbar too.
</blockquote>

One of the very first things the PostHog library does when `init()` is called is make a request to the `/decide` endpoint on PostHog's backend. This endpoint contains information on how to run the PostHog library so events are properly received in the backend. This endpoint is required to run most features of the library (detailed below). However, if you're not using any of the described features, you may wish to turn off the call completely to avoid an extra request and reduce resource usage on both the client and the server.

The `/decide` endpoint can be disabled by setting `advanced_disable_decide = true` in PostHog config.

**Resources dependent on `/decide`**

<blockquote class="warning-note">
    These are features/resources that will be fully disabled when the /decide endpoint is disabled.
</blockquote>

-   **Autocapture**. The `/decide` endpoint contains information on whether autocapture should be enabled or not (apart from local configuration).
-   **Session recording**. The endpoint contains information on where to send relevant session recording events.
-   **Compression**. The endpoint contains information on what compression methods are supported on the backend (e.g. LZ64, gzip) for event payloads.
-   **Feature flags**. The endpoint contains the feature flags enabled for the current person.
-   **Surveys**. The endpoint contains information on whether surveys should be enabled or not.
-   **Toolbar**. The endpoint contains authentication information and other toolbar capabilities information required to run it.

Any custom event capturing (`posthog.capture`), `$identify`, `$set`, `$set_once` and basically any other calls not detailed above will work as expected when `/decide` is disabled.

## AutocaptureConfig

The `autocapture` config takes an object providing full control of autocapture's behavior.

An empty array means no CSS selectors are allowed for capture, `undefined` means all CSS selectors are.                                                                                            |
| `element_attribute_ignorelist`<br/><br/>**Type:** Array of Strings <br/>**Default:** `undefined` |  An array of element attributes that autocapture will not capture. Both an empty array and `undefined` mean any of the attributes from the element are captured. |

## Debugging

In your dev console you can run `posthog.debug()`. This will enable debugging, easily allowing you to see all data that is being sent to PostHog.

## Development

For instructions on how to run `posthog-js` locally and setup your development environment, please checkout the README on the [posthog-js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js#README) repository.

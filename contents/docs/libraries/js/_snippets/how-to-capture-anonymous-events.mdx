PostHog captures identified events with person profiles by default. 

To change this and capture anonymous events in the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js), change the `person_profiles` [config](/docs/libraries/js#config) option:

import PersonProfilesJSConfig from './person-profiles-config.mdx'

<PersonProfilesJSConfig />

Other SDKs and the [API](/docs/api) can pass the `$process_person_profile` property in events. Again, identified events are enabled by default, but you can disable this by setting the property to `false`.

Below is an example in Node, but the same applies to other SDKs:

```node
client.capture({
    distinctId: 'distinct_id_of_the_user',
    event: 'movie_played',
    properties: {
        $process_person_profile: false,
    },
})
```

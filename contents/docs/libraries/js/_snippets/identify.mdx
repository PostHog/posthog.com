Using `identify`, you can capture identified events associated with specific users. This enables you to understand how they're using your product across different sessions, devices, and platforms.

```js-web
posthog.identify(
    'distinct_id', // Required. Replace 'distinct_id' with your user's unique identifier
    { email: 'max@hedgehogmail.com', name: 'Max Hedgehog' },  // $set, optional
    { first_visited_url: '/blog' } // $set_once, optional
);
```

Calling `identify` creates a person profile if one doesn't exist already. This means all events for that distinct ID count as identified events.

You can get the distinct ID of the current user by calling `posthog.get_distinct_id()`.

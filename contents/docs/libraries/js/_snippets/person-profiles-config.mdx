1. `person_profiles: 'always'` _(default)_ - We capture identified events and person profiles for all events.

2. `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` _(recommended)_ - We only capture identified events for users where  person profiles are already created. This is triggered by calling functions like `identify()`, `group()`, and [more](/docs/product-analytics/identify#processing-person-profiles). Anonymous events are captured from new users and don't create person profiles.

An example of an updated configuration looks like this:

```js-web
posthog.init(
    '<ph_project_api_key>',
    {
        api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
        person_profiles: 'identified_only'
    }
)
```

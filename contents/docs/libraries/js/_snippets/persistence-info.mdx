For PostHog to work optimally, we store a small amount of information about the user on the user's browser. This ensures we identify users properly if they navigate away from your site and come back later. 

The information we store includes:

-   Their `distinct_id`
-   Session ID & Device ID
-   Active & enabled feature flags
-   Any super properties you have defined
-   Some PostHog configuration options (e.g. whether session recording is enabled)

By default, we store all this information in both a `cookie` and `localStorage`, which means PostHog can identify your users across subdomains. By default, the name of the cookie PostHog sets is `ph_<project_api_key>_posthog` and it expires after `365` days.

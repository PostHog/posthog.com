## Capturing events

import WebSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-web.mdx'

<WebSendEvents />

## Anonymous and identified events

import IdentifiedVsAnonymousIntro from '../../product-analytics/_snippets/identified-vs-anonymous-intro.mdx'

<IdentifiedVsAnonymousIntro />

### Capturing anonymous events

import HowToCaptureAnonymousEventsWeb from '../../product-analytics/_snippets/how-to-capture-anonymous-events-web.mdx'

<HowToCaptureAnonymousEventsWeb />

### Capturing identified events

import HowToCaptureIdentifiedEventsWeb from '../../product-analytics/_snippets/how-to-capture-identified-events-frontend.mdx'

<HowToCaptureIdentifiedEventsWeb />

#### Identifying users

The most useful of these methods is `identify`. We strongly recommend reading our doc on [identifying users](/docs/product-analytics/identify) to better understand how to correctly use it.

import JSIdentify from './\_snippets/identify.mdx'

<JSIdentify />

## Setting person properties

To set [person properties](/docs/data/user-properties) in these profiles, include them when capturing an event:

```js-web
posthog.capture(
  'event_name',
  {
    $set: { name: 'Max Hedgehog'  },
    $set_once: { initial_url: '/blog' },
  }
)
```

Typically, person properties are set when an event occurs like `user updated email` but there may be occasions where you want to set person properties as its own event.

```js
posthog.setPersonProperties(
  { name: "Max Hedgehog" }, // These properties are like the `$set` from above
  { initial_url: "/blog" }  // These properties are like the `$set_once` from above
)
```

This creates a special `$set` event that is sent to PostHog. For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [person properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

## Resetting a user

If a user logs out or switches accounts, you should call `reset` to unlink any future events made on that device with that user. This prevents multiple users from being grouped together due to shared cookies between sessions. **We recommend you call `reset` on logout even if you don't expect users to share a computer.**

You can do that like so:

```js-web
posthog.reset()
```

If you _also_ want to reset `device_id`, you can pass `true` as a parameter:

```js-web
posthog.reset(true)
```

This also resets group analytics.

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend.

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```js-web
posthog.alias('alias_id', 'distinct_id');
```

We recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Group analytics

[Group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics) enables you to associate the events for that person's session with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.).

> **Note:** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

This is done by calling the `group` method with a group type and group ID.

```js-web
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db')

posthog.capture('upgraded_plan') // this event is associated with company ID `company_id_in_your_db`
```

You can also set group properties by passing a third argument to the `group` method.

```js-web
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db', {
    name: 'Awesome Inc.',
    employees: 11,
})
```

The `name` is a special property used in the PostHog UI for the name of the group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID is used instead.

## Super properties

Super properties are properties associated with events that are set once and then sent with every `capture` call across sessions, be it a `$pageview`, an autocaptured button click, or anything else.

They are set using `posthog.register`, which takes a properties object as a parameter like this:

```js-web
posthog.register({
    'icecream_pref': 'vanilla',
})
```

The call above ensures that every event sent includes a `"icecream pref": "vanilla"` property. This way, if you filtered events by property using `icecream_pref = vanilla`, it would display all events captured on that user after the `posthog.register` call, since they all include the specified super property.

This does **not** set a person or group property. It only sets the properties on events.

Furthermore, if you register the same property multiple times, the next event will use the new value of that property. If you want to register a property only once (e.g. for ad campaign properties), you can use `register_once`, like so:

```js-web
posthog.register_once({
    'campaign_source': 'twitter',
})
```

Using `register_once` ensures that if a property is already set, it is not set again. For example, if the user already has property `"icecream_pref": "vanilla"`, calling `posthog.register_once({"icecream_pref": "chocolate"})` will **not** update the property.

### Removing stored super properties

Setting super properties creates a cookie on the client with the respective properties and their values. To stop sending a super property with events and remove the cookie, you can use `posthog.unregister`, like so:

```js-web
posthog.unregister('icecream_pref')
```

This removes the super property and subsequent events will not include it.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import WebFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-web.mdx'

<WebFeatureFlagsCode />

### Bootstrapping flags

import BootstrappingIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/bootstrapping-intro.mdx"

<BootstrappingIntro />

For details on how to implement bootstrapping, see our [bootstrapping guide](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping).

### Enriched flag analytics

You can send enriched analytics data for feature flags to help uncover replays where people interact with a flag, target people who've interacted with a feature, or build cohorts of people who've viewed a feature.

To enable this, you can either use our `<PosthogFeature>` [React component](/docs/libraries/react#feature-flags-react-component) (which implements this for you), or implement it yourself.

To do it yourself, there are 3 things you need to do:

1. Whenever a feature is viewed, send the `$feature_view` event with the property `feature_flag` set to the name of the flag.

```javascript
posthog.capture('$feature_view', { feature_flag: flag })
```
2. Whenever someone interacts with a feature, send a `$feature_interaction` event with the property `feature_flag` set to the name of the flag.

3. At the same time, set the person property `$feature_interaction/<flag-key>` to true.

```javascript
posthog.capture('$feature_interaction', {
    feature_flag: flag,
    $set: { [`$feature_interaction/${flag}`]: true }
})
```

See [the React component](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/master/react/src/components/PostHogFeature.tsx#L48C10-L48C35) for another example.

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```js-web
// Ensure flags are loaded before usage.
// You'll only need to call this on the code the first time a user visits.
// See this doc for more details: /docs/feature-flags/manual#ensuring-flags-are-loaded-before-usage
posthog.onFeatureFlags(function() {
  // feature flags should be available at this point
  if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key')  == 'variant-name') {
    // do something
  }
})

// Otherwise, you can just do:
if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('experiment-feature-flag-key')  == 'variant-name') {
  // do something
}

// You can also test your code by overriding the feature flag:
// e.g., posthog.featureFlags.overrideFeatureFlags({ flags: {'experiment-feature-flag-key': 'test'}})
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

## Early access feature management

Early access features give you the option to release feature flags that can be controlled by your users. More information on this can be found [here](/docs/feature-flags/early-access-feature-management).

```js-web
posthog.getEarlyAccessFeatures((previewItemData) => {
  // do something with early access feature
})
```

```js-web
posthog.updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment(flagKey, 'true')
```

## Surveys

[Surveys](/docs/surveys) launched with [popover presentation](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#presentation) are automatically shown to users matching the [display conditions](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys#display-conditions) you set up.

You can also [render *unstyled* surveys programmatically](/docs/surveys/implementing-custom-surveys) with the `renderSurvey` method.

```js-web
posthog.renderSurvey('survey_id', '#survey-container')
```

To disable loading surveys in a specific client, you can set the `disable_surveys` [config option](/docs/libraries/js/config).

Surveys using the **API** presentation enables you to implement your own survey UI and use PostHog to handle display logic, capturing results, and analytics.

To implement **API** surveys, start by fetching active surveys for a user using either of the methods below:

```js-web
// Fetch enabled surveys for the current user
posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys(callback, forceReload)

// Fetch all surveys
posthog.getSurveys(callback, forceReload)
```

The response returns an array of survey objects and is cached by default. To force a reload, pass `true` as the `forceReload` argument.

The survey objects look like this:

```json
[{
  "id": "your_survey_id",
  "name": "Your survey name",
  "description": "Metadata describing your survey",
  "type": "api", // either "api", "popover", or "widget"
  "linked_flag_key": null, // linked feature flag key, if any.
  "targeting_flag_key": "your_survey_targeting_flag_key",
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "single_choice",
      "choices": [
        "Yes",
        "No"
      ],
      "question": "Are you enjoying PostHog?"
    }
  ],
  "conditions": null,
  "start_date": "2023-09-19T13:10:49.505000Z",
  "end_date": null
}]
```

### Capturing survey events

To capture survey results properly in PostHog, you need to capture 3 types of events:

```js-web
// 1. When a user is shown a survey
posthog.capture("survey shown", {
  $survey_id: survey.id // required
})

// 2. When a user has dismissed a survey
posthog.capture("survey dismissed", {
  $survey_id: survey.id // required
})

// 3. When a user has responded to a survey
posthog.capture("survey sent", {
  $survey_id: survey.id, // required
  $survey_questions: [
    {
      id: "d8462827-1575-4e1e-ab1d-b5fddd9f829c",
      question: "What is your favorite color?",
    }
  ]
  $survey_response_d8462827-1575-4e1e-ab1d-b5fddd9f829c: survey_response // required. `survey_response` must be a text value.
  // Convert numbers to text e.g. 8 should be converted to "8".
  // For multiple choice select surveys, `survey_response` must be an array of values with the selected choices.
  // e.g., $survey_response_d8462827-1575-4e1e-ab1d-b5fddd9f829c: ["response_1", "response_2"]
})
```

## Session replay

To set up [session replay](/docs/session-replay) in your project, all you need to do is install the JavaScript web library and enable "Record user sessions" in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay).

For [fine-tuning control](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record) of which sessions you record, you can use [feature flags](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#with-feature-flags), [sampling](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#sampling), [minimum duration](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#minimum-duration), or set the `disable_session_recording` [config option](/docs/libraries/js/config) and use the following methods:

```js-web
// Turns session recording on
posthog.startSessionRecording()

// Turns session recording off
posthog.stopSessionRecording()

// Check if session recording is currently running
posthog.sessionRecordingStarted()
```

If you are using feature flags or sampling to control which sessions you record, you can override the default behavior (and start a recording regardless) by passing the `linked_flag` or `sampling` overrides. The following would start a recording for all users, even if they don't match the flag or aren't in the sample:

```js-web
posthog.startSessionRecording({ linked_flag: true, sampling: true })
```

To get the playback URL of the current session replay, you can use the following method:

```js-web
posthog.get_session_replay_url(
  { withTimestamp: true, timestampLookBack: 30 }
)
```

It has two optional parameters:

- `withTimestamp` (default: `false`): When set to `true`, the URL includes a timestamp that takes you to the session at the time of the event.
- `timestampLookBack` (default: `10`): The number of seconds back the timestamp links to.

Session replay uses [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb) under the hood, which is configurable with the `session_recording` parameter.

The documentation and defaults for these options can be found in the [rrweb docs](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/blob/master/guide.md#options).

The defaults are the same as in rrweb, except for these fields:

| key                      | PostHog default    | description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| blockClass               | 'ph-no-capture'    | Use a string or RegExp to configure which elements should be blocked, refer to the [privacy](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/blob/master/guide.md#privacy) chapter                          |
| ignoreClass              | 'ph-ignore-input'  | Use a string or RegExp to configure which elements should be ignored, refer to the [privacy](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/blob/master/guide.md#privacy) chapter                          |
| maskTextClass            | 'ph-mask'          | Use a string or RegExp to configure which elements should be masked, refer to the [privacy](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/blob/master/guide.md#privacy) chapter                           |
| maskAllInputs            | true               | mask all input content as \*                                                                                                                                                                  |

The defaults for `maskAllInputs`, `maskTextSelector` and `blockSelector` will change depending on your masking configuration in the session replay section of [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay-masking).

## Error tracking

You can enable [exception autocapture](/docs/error-tracking/installation) in the **Autocapture & heatmaps** section of [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-autocapture#exception-autocapture). When enabled, this automatically captures `$exception` events when errors are thrown.

It is also possible to manually capture exceptions using the `captureException` method:

```js
posthog.captureException(error, additionalProperties)
```

## Amending or sampling events

Since version 1.187.0, you can provide a `before_send` function when initializing the SDK to amend, filter, sample, or reject events before they are sent to PostHog.

> **🚨 Warning:** Amending and sampling events is advanced functionality and should be done with care. It can cause unexpected results in parts of PostHog.

### Redacting information in events

`before_send` gives you one place to edit or redact information before it is sent to PostHog. For example:

<details>
<summary>Redact URLs in event properties</summary>

```ts
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    before_send: (event: CaptureResult | null): CaptureResult | null => {
        if (!event) {
            return null
        }

        // redacting URLs will be specific to your site structure
        function redactUrl(value: string): string {
            return value.replace(/project\/\d+/, 'project/1234567');
        }

        function redactObject(objectToRedact: Record<string, any>): Record<string, any> {
            return Object.entries(objectToRedact).reduce((acc, [key, value]) => {
                if (key !== '_url' && (key.includes('url') || key === 'u') && typeof value === 'string') {
                    acc[key] = redactUrl(value)
                } else if (typeof value === 'object' && value) {
                    acc[key] = redactObject(value)
                } else {
                    acc[key] = value
                }
                return acc
            }, {});
        }

        const redactedProperties = redactObject(event.properties || {});
        event.properties = redactedProperties

        const redactedSet = redactObject(event.$set || {});
        event.$set = redactedSet

        const redactedSetOnce = redactObject(event.$set_once || {});
        event.$set_once = redactedSetOnce

        return event
    }
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Redact person properties in $set or $set_once</summary>

```ts
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    before_send: (event: CaptureResult | null): CaptureResult | null => {
        if (!event) {
            return null
        }

        event.$set = {
            ...event.$set,
            name: 'secret name'
        }
        event.$set_once = {
            ...event.$set_once,
            initial_name: 'secret name'
        }

        return event
    }
})
```

</details>

### Sampling events

Sampling lets you choose to send only a percentage of events to PostHog. It is a good way to control your costs without having to completely turn off features of the SDK.

Some functions of PostHog, for example much of web analytics, rely on receiving all events. Sampling `$pageview ` or `$pageleave` events in particular can cause unexpected results.

#### Sampling events using our provided customization

We offer a pre-built `sampleByEvent` function to sample by event name. You can import this using a package manager, or add the customization script to your site.

<MultiLanguage>

```ts file=Import
import { sampleByEvent } from 'posthog-js/lib/src/customizations'

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // capture only half of dead click and web vitals events
  before_send: sampleByEvent(['$dead_click', '$web_vitals'], 0.5)
})
```

```tsx file=Script
// Add this script to your site, may need to change the script src to match your API host:
// <script type="text/javascript" src="https://us.i.posthog.com/static/customizations.full.js"></script>

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  // capture only half of dead click and web vitals events
  before_send: posthogCustomizations.sampleByEvent(['$dead_click', '$web_vitals'], 0.5)
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

This can be used to sample events by name, distinct ID, session ID, or custom function.

<details>
<summary>Send no events while developing</summary>

When working locally it can be useful to see what PostHog would do, without actually sending the data to PostHog

```ts
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: (event: CaptureResult | null): CaptureResult | null => {
    if (event) {
      console.log('posthog event: ' + event.event, event)
    }
    return null
  }
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sampling by person distinct ID</summary>

We offer a pre-built `sampleByDistinctId` function to sample a percentage of events by person distinct ID (in the example below, 40% of events). You can import this using a package manager, or add the customization script to your site.

> **Note:** A particular distinct ID will always either send all events or no events.

<MultiLanguage>

```ts file=Import
import { sampleByDistinctId } from 'posthog-js/lib/src/customizations'

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: sampleByDistinctId(0.4)
})
```

```ts file=Script
// Add this script to your site, may need to change the script src to match your API host:
// <script type="text/javascript" src="https://us.i.posthog.com/static/customizations.full.js"></script>

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: posthogCustomizations.sampleByDistinctId(0.4)
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sampling by session ID</summary>

We offer a pre-built `sampleBySessionId` function to sample a percentage of events by session ID (in the example below, 25% of events). You can import this using a package manager, or add the customization script to your site.

> **Note:** A particular session ID will always either send all events or no events.

<MultiLanguage>

```ts file=Import
import { sampleBySessionId } from 'posthog-js/lib/src/customizations'

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: sampleBySessionId(0.25)
})
```

```ts file=Script
// Add this script to your site, may need to change the script src to match your API host:
// <script type="text/javascript" src="https://us.i.posthog.com/static/customizations.full.js"></script>

posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: posthogCustomizations.sampleBySessionId(0.25)
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sampling events using a custom function</summary>

If none of the provided sampling functions meet your needs, you can provide a custom function to sample events.

```ts
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: (event: CaptureResult | null): CaptureResult | null => {
    if (!event) {
      return null
    }

    let sampleRate = 1.0 // default to always returning the event
    if (event.event === '$heatmap') {
      sampleRate = 0.1
    }
    if (event.event === '$dead_click') {
      sampleRate = 0.01
    }
    return Math.random() < sampleRate ? event : null
  }
})
```

</details>

### Chaining before_send functions

You can provide an array of functions to be called one after the other:

```ts
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  before_send: [
    sampleByDistinctId(0.5), // only half of people
    sampleByEvent(['$web_vitals'], 0.1), // and they capture all events except 10% of web vitals
    sampleByEvent(['$$heatmap'], 0.5), // and 50% of heatmaps
  ]
})
```

## Blocking bad actors

PostHog tries to automatically block known crawlers and web/AI agents. It's a fact, however, that not every crawler will advertise themselves as a crawler.

If you see an unusual number of visitors in your project, you can try and understand where they're coming from by using [web analytics](https://us.posthog.com/web). It's common, however, that they will all contain the exact same user agent string. You can verify the most common user agents by using [this trend insight](https://app.posthog.com/insights/new#q=%7B%22kind%22%3A%22InsightVizNode%22%2C%22source%22%3A%7B%22kind%22%3A%22TrendsQuery%22%2C%22series%22%3A%5B%7B%22kind%22%3A%22EventsNode%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22%24pageview%22%2C%22event%22%3A%22%24pageview%22%2C%22math%22%3A%22total%22%7D%5D%2C%22trendsFilter%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22breakdownFilter%22%3A%7B%22breakdowns%22%3A%5B%7B%22property%22%3A%22%24raw_user_agent%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22event%22%7D%5D%7D%7D%7D%20).

If a specific user agent is causing problems (many more events than other user agents), you can block it by adding it to `custom_blocked_useragents` in your PostHog initialization:

```ts
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  custom_blocked_useragents: ['<user_agent_string>']
})
```

### Lighthouse audits

Lighthouse is known for not advertising itself. If you're using a tool that uses Lighthouse to monitor your website (or if a competitor does), PostHog won't be able to prevent those events by default, which might skew your numbers. Ahrefs and Semrush are examples of this.

Lighthouse user agents are well-known but they're not blocked by default because they represent possibly legitimate users. If you're experiencing a high number of events from these sources, you can block them by adding them to your `custom_blocked_useragents` list in your PostHog initialization:

This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Java. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import JavaInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-java.mdx'

<JavaInstall />

## Making calls

### Capture

Capture allows you to capture anything a user does within your system, which you can later use in PostHog to find patterns in usage, work out which features to improve or where people are giving up.

A `capture` call requires:

- `distinct id` which uniquely identifies your user
- `event name` to specify the event

> We recommend naming events with "[noun] [verb]", such as `movie played` or `movie updated`, in order to easily identify what your events mean later on (we know this from experience).

Optionally you can submit:

- `properties` which is a dictionary with any information you'd like to add

```java
posthog.capture("distinct id", "movie played", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("movie_id", 123);
    put("category", "romcom");
  }
});
```

### Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$set",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {       
      {
        put("name", "Max Hedgehog");
      }
    });
    put("$set_once",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {
      {
        put("initial_url", "/blog");
      }
    });
  }
});
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

### Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Java. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import JavaInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-java.mdx'

<JavaInstall />


## Capturing events

import JavaSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-java.mdx'

<JavaSendEvents />

## Person profiles and user properties

For backward compatibility, PostHog captures events with person profiles by default. To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties) in these profiles, include them when capturing an event:

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$set",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {       
      {
        put("name", "Max Hedgehog");
      }
    });
    put("$set_once",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {
      {
        put("initial_url", "/blog");
      }
    });
  }
});
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

To capture events without person profiles, set the event's `$process_person_profile` property to `false`:

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$process_person_profile", false);
  }
});
```

## Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import JavaFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-java.mdx'

<JavaFeatureFlagsCode />

import LocalEvaluationIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/local-evaluation-intro.mdx"

### Local Evaluation

<LocalEvaluationIntro />

For details on how to implement local evaluation, see our [local evaluation guide](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation).

## Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:


```java
Optional<String> variant = posthog.getFeatureFlagVariant("experimentfeature-flag-name", "user_distinct_id");

if (variant.isPresent() && variant.get().equals("variant-key")) {
    // Do something differently for this user
}
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

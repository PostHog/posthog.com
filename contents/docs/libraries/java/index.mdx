This is an optional library you can install if you're working with Java. It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import JavaInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-java.mdx'

<JavaInstall />


## Capturing events

import JavaSendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-java.mdx'

<JavaSendEvents />

## Person profiles and properties

For backward compatibility, the Java SDK captures identified events by default. These create [person profiles](/docs/data/persons). To set [person properties](/docs/data/user-properties) in these profiles, include them when capturing an event:

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$set",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {       
      {
        put("name", "Max Hedgehog");
      }
    });
    put("$set_once",  new HashMap<String, Object>() {
      {
        put("initial_url", "/blog");
      }
    });
  }
});
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [person properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

To capture [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) without person profiles, set the event's `$process_person_profile` property to `false`:

```java
posthog.capture("distinct_id", "event_name", new HashMap<String, Object>() {
  {
    put("$process_person_profile", false);
  }
});
```

## Alias

Sometimes, you want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful when your primary distinct ID is inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID used on the frontend is not available in your backend. 

In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

```java
posthog.alias("distinct_id", "alias_id");
```

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

Feature flags are not supported yet in our Java SDK. However, you can integrate them into your project by using the [PostHog API](/docs/feature-flags/adding-feature-flag-code?tab=api).

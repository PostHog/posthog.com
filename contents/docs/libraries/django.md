PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your Django app. Integrating PostHog enables analytics, custom events capture, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Django app using the [Python SDK](/docs/libraries/python).

## Installation

To start, run `pip install posthog` to install PostHogâ€™s Python SDK.

Then, set the PostHog API key and host in your `AppConfig` in your `your_app/apps.py` so that's it's available everywhere:

```python file=your_app/apps.py
from django.apps import AppConfig
import posthog

class YourAppConfig(AppConfig):
    name = "your_app_name"
    def ready(self):
        posthog.api_key = '<ph_project_api_key>'
        posthog.host = '<ph_client_api_host>'
```

You can find your project API key and instance address in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/settings). 

Next, if you haven't done so already, make sure you add your `AppConfig` to your `settings.py` under `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python file=settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'your_app_name.apps.MyAppConfig',  # Add your app config
]
```

Lastly, to access PostHog in any file, simply `import posthog` and call the method you'd like. For example, to capture an event:

```python
import posthog

def some_request(request):
    posthog.capture('distinct_id_of_the_user', 'event_name')
```

## Error tracking

If you're using Django 4.2+, you can enable the [exception autocapture integration](/docs/error-tracking/installation) which will automatically capture Django errors.

```python
from posthog.exception_capture import Integrations

Posthog("<ph_project_api_key>", enable_exception_autocapture=True, exception_autocapture_integrations = [Integrations.Django])
```

## Next steps

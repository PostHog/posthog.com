Message formatting works the same way whether you are using Slack or Microsoft Teams.

Tokens are in the format `[type.prop]`.

Message format can be customised when editing/creating an Action.

By default, the message format is
```

```

- `name`: name of triggered action with link.

## Event
- `name`: name of the event which triggered the Action with link.

## User
- `name`: user's username, email, or distinct ID depending on availability.
- `ip`: IP address used by user when the action was triggered.
- `os`: user's Operating System.

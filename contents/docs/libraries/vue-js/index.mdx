PostHog makes it easy to get data about usage of your [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app. Integrating PostHog into your app enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session replays, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your app for both Vue 2 and Vue 3. We'll use the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js) for this.

For integrating PostHog into a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) app, see our [Nuxt guide](/docs/libraries/nuxt-js).

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide along, you need:

1. A [PostHog account](https://app.posthog.com/signup)
2. A running Vue.js app

## Setting up PostHog

import VueSetup from "../../integrate/_snippets/vuejs/vue-setup.mdx"

<VueSetup />

## Capturing custom events, using feature flags, and more

Once you have PostHog initialized, there is a lot more you can do with it beyond autocapture, pageviews, and pageleaves. You can find the full details in our [JavaScript SDK docs](/docs/libraries/js/features), but we'll cover a few examples here.

import Tab from "components/Tab"
import CompositionEvents from "./_snippets/composition-events.mdx"
import PluginEvents from "./_snippets/plugin-events.mdx"

<Tab.Group tabs={[
    'Vue 3: Composition API', 
    'Vue 2: Plugins']}>
    <Tab.List>
        <Tab>Vue 3: Composition API</Tab>
        <Tab>Vue 2: Plugins</Tab>
    </Tab.List>
    <Tab.Panels>
        <Tab.Panel>
            <CompositionEvents />
        </Tab.Panel>
        <Tab.Panel>
            <PluginEvents />
        </Tab.Panel>
    </Tab.Panels>
</Tab.Group>

If you are using Nuxt.js and want to track your application using PostHog this tutorial might help you out. 

It will guide you through an example integration of PostHog using Nuxt.js. 

### Is this tutorial for me?

This tutorial is aimed at Nuxt.js users which run Nuxt in `spa` or `universal` mode. 
We are going to look at some minimal example code which should get you started quickly and provide a base for further customization.

### Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial along, you need to:

1. Have [deployed PostHog](/docs/deployment).
2. Have a running Nuxt.js application

### Minimal example

We are going to implement PostHog as a [Nuxt.js integration](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins) which gives us the possibility to inject
the posthog object and make it available across our application.

The first thing you want to do is to install the [posthog-js library](/docs/integrate/client/js) in your project - so add it using your package manager:

```shell
yarn add posthog-js
```

or

```shell
npm install --save posthog-js
```

After that we want to create a app in `plugins/posthog/index.js`

```javascript
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import Vue from 'vue'

export default function({ app: { router } }, inject) {
  // Init PostHog
  posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    capture_pageview: false,
    loaded: () => posthog.identify('unique_id') // If you can already identify your user
  })

  // Inject PostHog into the application and make it available via this.$posthog (or app.$posthog)
  inject('posthog', posthog)

  // Make sure that pageviews are captured with each route change
  router.afterEach(to => {
    Vue.nextTick(() => {
      /* Note: this might also be a good place to call posthog.register(...) in order to update your properties
      on each page view
      */
      posthog.capture('$pageview', {
        $current_url: to.fullPath
      })
    })
  })
}

```

Finally, we need to activate it on the client side in our `nuxt.config.js`

```javascript
plugins: [
    ...
    { src: './plugins/posthog', mode: 'client' }
  ],
```

### Usage

By using the example code above you can now use PostHog across your app with `this.$posthog` or `app.$posthog` - depending on the context. 
Compare with the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins#inject-in-root--context) on further details when to use `app.$posthog` or `this.$posthog`.

Let's say for example the user makes a purchase you could track an event like that:

```javascript
<template>
  <button @click="purchase">Buy</button>
</template>

<script>
...
  methods: {
     purchase() {
       this.$posthog.capture('purchase')
     }
  }
...
</script>
```

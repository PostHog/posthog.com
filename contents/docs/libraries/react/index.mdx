PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your React app. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, feature flags, and more.

This guide walks you through an example integration of PostHog using React and the [posthog-js library](/docs/integrate/client/js).

import AgentIntegrationSection from "../../components/AgentIntegrationSection.mdx"

<AgentIntegrationSection framework="React" />

## Installation

import ReactInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-react.mdx'

<ReactInstall />

<DetailSetUpReverseProxy />

<DetailGroupProductsInOneProject />

## Usage

### PostHog provider

The React context provider makes it easy to access the `posthog-js` library in your app.

The provider takes an initialized and configured client instance like this:

```react
// src/index.js
import posthog from 'posthog-js';
import { PostHogProvider} from 'posthog-js/react'

posthog.init(process.env.REACT_APP_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, {
  api_host: process.env.REACT_APP_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
});

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>
      <App />
    </PostHogProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Using posthog-js functions

By default, the `posthog-js` library automatically captures pageviews, element clicks, inputs, and more. Autocapture can be tuned in with [the configuration options](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#configuring-autocapture).

If you want to use the library to identify users, capture events, use feature flags, or use other features, you can access the initialized `posthog-js` library using the `usePostHog` hook.

**Do not directly import `posthog` apart from installation** as shown above. This will likely cause errors as the library might not be initialized yet. Initialization is handled automatically when you use the `PostHogProvider` and hook.

All the methods of the library are available and can be used as described in the [posthog-js documentation](/docs/libraries/js).

```react
import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-js/react'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useUser, useLogin } from '../lib/user'

function App() {
    const posthog = usePostHog()
    const login = useLogin()
    const user = useUser()

    useEffect(() => {
        if (user) {
            // Identify sends an event, so you may want to limit how often you call it
            posthog?.identify(user.id, {
                email: user.email,
            })
            posthog?.group('company', user.company_id)
        }
    }, [posthog, user.id, user.email, user.company_id])

    const loginClicked = () => {
        posthog?.capture('clicked_log_in')
        login()
    }

    return (
        <div className="App">
            {/* Fire a custom event when the button is clicked */}
            <button onClick={() => posthog?.capture('button_clicked')}>Click me</button>
            {/* This button click event is autocaptured by default */}
            <button data-attr="autocapture-button">Autocapture buttons</button>
            {/* This button click event is not autocaptured */}
            <button className="ph-no-capture">Ignore certain elements</button>
            <button onClick={loginClicked}>Login</button>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App
```

#### TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined

If you see the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')` this is likely because you tried to call a posthog function when posthog was not initialized (such as during the initial render). On purpose, we still render the children even if PostHog is not initialized so that your app still loads even if PostHog can't load.

To fix this error, add a check that posthog has been initialized such as:

```react
useEffect(() => {
  posthog?.capture('test') // using optional chaining (recommended)

  if (posthog) {
    posthog.capture('test') // using an if statement
  }
}, [posthog])
```

Typescript helps protect against these errors.

### Tracking element visibility

The `PostHogCaptureOnViewed` component enables you to automatically capture events when elements scroll into view in the browser. This is useful for tracking impressions of important content, monitoring user engagement with specific sections, or understanding which parts of your page users are actually seeing.

The component wraps your content and sends a `$element_viewed` event to PostHog when the wrapped element becomes visible in the viewport. It only fires once per component instance.

#### Basic usage

```react
import { PostHogCaptureOnViewed } from 'posthog-js/react'

function App() {
    return (
        <PostHogCaptureOnViewed name="hero-banner">
            <div>Your important content here</div>
        </PostHogCaptureOnViewed>
    )
}
```

#### With custom properties

You can include additional properties with the event to provide more context:

```react
<PostHogCaptureOnViewed
    name="product-card"
    properties={{ 
        product_id: '123', 
        category: 'electronics',
        price: 299.99
    }}
>
    <ProductCard />
</PostHogCaptureOnViewed>
```

#### Tracking multiple children

Use `trackAllChildren` to track each child element separately. This is useful for galleries or lists where you want to know which specific items were viewed:

```react
<PostHogCaptureOnViewed
    name="product-gallery"
    properties={{ gallery_type: 'featured' }}
    trackAllChildren
>
    <ProductCard id="1" />
    <ProductCard id="2" />
    <ProductCard id="3" />
</PostHogCaptureOnViewed>
```

When `trackAllChildren` is enabled, each child element sends its own event with a `child_index` property indicating its position.

#### Custom intersection observer options

You can customize when elements are considered "viewed" by passing options to the IntersectionObserver:

```react
<PostHogCaptureOnViewed
    name="footer"
    observerOptions={{ 
        threshold: 0.5,  // Element is 50% visible
        rootMargin: '0px'
    }}
>
    <Footer />
</PostHogCaptureOnViewed>
```

The component passes all other props to the wrapper `div`, so you can add styling, classes, or other HTML attributes as needed.

## Feature flags

import FeatureFlagsLibsIntro from "../_snippets/feature-flags-libs-intro.mdx"

<FeatureFlagsLibsIntro />

import ReactFeatureFlagsCode from '../../integrate/feature-flags-code/_snippets/feature-flags-code-react.mdx'

<ReactFeatureFlagsCode />

### Bootstrapping flags

import BootstrappingIntro from "../../feature-flags/snippets/bootstrapping-intro.mdx"

<BootstrappingIntro />

For details on how to implement bootstrapping, see our [bootstrapping guide](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping).

### Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```react
// You can either use the `useFeatureFlagVariantKey` hook,
// or you can use the feature flags component - /docs/libraries/react#feature-flags-react-component

// Method one: using the useFeatureFlagVariantKey hook
import { useFeatureFlagVariantKey } from 'posthog-js/react'

function App() {
    const variant = useFeatureFlagVariantKey('experiment-feature-flag-key')
    if (variant == 'variant-name') {
        // do something
    }
}

// Method two: using the feature flags component
import { PostHogFeature } from 'posthog-js/react'

function App() {
    return (
        <PostHogFeature flag='experiment-feature-flag-key' match={'variant-name'}>
            <!-- the component to show -->
        </PostHogFeature>
    )
}

// You can also test your code by overriding the feature flag:
// e.g., posthog.featureFlags.overrideFeatureFlags({ flags: {'experiment-feature-flag-key': 'test'}})
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

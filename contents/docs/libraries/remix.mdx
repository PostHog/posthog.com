PostHog makes it easy to get data about traffic and usage of your [Remix](https://remix.run/) app. Integrating PostHog into your site enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session recordings, feature flags, and more.

Remix V3 is now React Router V7 framework mode. Please refer to the [React Router V7 framework mode](/docs/libraries/react-router/react-router-v7-framework-mode) guide instead for instructions on how to integrate PostHog.

This guide walks you through integrating PostHog into your Remix app using the [JavaScript Web SDK](/docs/libraries/js).

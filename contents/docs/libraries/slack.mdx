## Using PostHog AI in Slack

Once you've added the PostHog app to your workspace and channels, you can ask PostHog AI questions by mentioning @PostHog in any channel where the app is installed.

For example, you can ask:
- "What were the top features used this week?"
- "Show me conversion rate trends"
- "How many users signed up yesterday?"

PostHog AI will analyze your product data and provide answers directly in the Slack thread.

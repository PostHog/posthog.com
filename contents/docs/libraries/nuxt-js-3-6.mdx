PostHog makes it easy to get data about usage of your [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) app. Integrating PostHog into your app enables analytics about user behavior, custom events capture, session replays, feature flags, and more.

These docs are for Nuxt v3.0 to v3.6. You can see a working example of the Nuxt v3.0 integration in our [Nuxt.js demo app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/tree/master/playground/nuxtjs)

## Setting up PostHog on the client side

import NuxtInstall from "../integrate/_snippets/install-nuxt.mdx"

<NuxtInstall />

PostHog can then be accessed throughout your Nuxt.js using the provider accessor, for example:

```vue filename=index.vue
<script setup>
   const { $posthog } = useNuxtApp()
   if ($posthog) {
      const posthog = $posthog()
      posthog.capture('<event_name>')
   }
</script>
```

See the [JavaScript SDK docs](/docs/libraries/js/features) for all usable functions, such as:
- [Capture custom event capture, identify users, and more.](/docs/libraries/js/features#capturing-events)
- [Feature flags including variants and payloads.](/docs/libraries/js/features#feature-flags)

<DetailSetUpReverseProxy />

<DetailGroupProductsInOneProject />

<DetailPostHogIPs />

## Setting up PostHog on the server side

Install `posthog-node` using your package manager:

import InstallNodePackageManagers from "../integrate/_snippets/install-node-package-managers.mdx"

<InstallNodePackageManagers />

Add your PostHog API key and host to your `nuxt.config.js` file. If you've already done this when adding PostHog to the client side, you can skip this step.

```js file=nuxt.config.js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    public: {
      posthogPublicKey: '<ph_project_api_key>',
      posthogHost: '<ph_client_api_host>',
      posthogDefaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
    }
  }
})
```

Initialize the PostHog Node client where you'd like to use it on the server side. For example, in a [server route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes):

```js file=server/api/example.js focusOnLines=7-27
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const rawCookie = getCookie(event, `ph_${runtimeConfig.public.posthogPublicKey}_posthog`)
  const distinctID = rawCookie ? JSON.parse(rawCookie)?.distinct_id : undefined
  const url = getRequestURL(event)
  const query = getQuery(event)

  const { PostHog } = await import('posthog-node');
  const runtimeConfig = useRuntimeConfig()

  const posthog = new PostHog(
    runtimeConfig.public.posthogPublicKey,
    { 
      host: runtimeConfig.public.posthogHost, 
    }
  );

  posthog.capture({
    event: 'api_call',
    distinctId: distinctId,
    properties: {
      $current_url: url,
      query: query
    }
  })
  posthog.shutdown()

  return {
    message: "example response"
  }
})
```

> **Note**: Make sure to _always_ call `posthog.shutdown()` after capturing events from the server-side.
> PostHog queues events into larger batches, and this call forces all batched events to be flushed immediately.

See the [Node SDK docs](/docs/libraries/node) for all usable functions, such as:
- [Capture custom event capture, identify users, and more.](/docs/libraries/node#capturing-events)
- [Feature flags including variants and payloads.](/docs/libraries/node#feature-flags)

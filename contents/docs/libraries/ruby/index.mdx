The `posthog-ruby` library provides tracking functionality on the server-side for applications built in Ruby.

It uses an internal queue to make calls fast and non-blocking. It also batches requests and flushes asynchronously, making it perfect to use in any part of your web app or other server-side application that needs performance.

## Installation

import RubyInstall from '../../integrate/_snippets/install-ruby.mdx'

<RubyInstall />

### Debug logging

The log level by default is set to WARN. You can change it to DEBUG if you want to debug the client by running `posthog.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG`, where `posthog` is your initialized `PostHog::Client` instance.

## Making calls

### Sending events

import RubySendEvents from '../../integrate/send-events/_snippets/send-events-ruby.mdx'

<RubySendEvents />

### Setting user properties

To set [user properties](/docs/data/user-properties), include the properties you'd like to set when capturing an event: 

```php
posthog.capture({
    distinct_id: 'distinct_id',
    event: 'event_name',
    properties: {
        '$set': { name: 'Max Hedgehog' },
        '$set_once': { initial_url: '/blog' }
    }
})
```

For more details on the difference between `$set` and `$set_once`, see our [user properties docs](/docs/data/user-properties#what-is-the-difference-between-set-and-set_once).

### Alias

Sometimes, you may want to assign multiple distinct IDs to a single user. This is helpful in scenarios where your primary distinct ID may be inaccessible. For example, if a distinct ID which is typically used on the frontend is not available in certain parts of your backend code. In this case, you can use `alias` to assign another distinct ID to the same user.

We strongly recommend reading our docs on [alias](/docs/data/identify#alias-assigning-multiple-distinct-ids-to-the-same-user) to best understand how to correctly use this method.

### Feature flags

PostHog's [feature flags](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags) enable you to safely deploy and roll back new features.

When using them with one of libraries, you should check if a feature flag is enabled and use the result to toggle functionality on and off in you application.

**How to check if a flag is enabled**

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `Nil`, instead of `true` or `false`.

```ruby
posthog.is_feature_enabled('beta-feature', 'distinct id')
# returns True or False or Nil
```

**Example use case**

Here's how you might send different users a different version of your homepage, for example:

```ruby
def homepage(request):
    template = "new.html" if posthog.is_feature_enabled('new_ui', 'distinct id') else "old.html"
    return render_template(template, request=request)
```

> **Note:** Feature flags are persistent for users across sessions. Read more about feature flag persistence on our [dedicated page](/docs/user-guides/feature-flags#feature-flag-persistence).

**Get a flag value**

If you're using multivariate feature flags, you can also get not just whether the flag is enabled, but what value its enabled to.

> **Note:** Whenever we face an error computing the flag, the library returns `Nil`, instead of `true` or `false` or a string variant value.

```ruby
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id')
# returns string or True or False or Nil
```

**Overriding server properties**

Sometimes, you might want to evaluate feature flags using properties that haven't been ingested yet, or were set incorrectly earlier. You can do so by setting properties the flag depends on with these calls.

For example, if the `beta-feature` depends on the `is_authorized` property, and you know the value of the property, you can tell PostHog to use this property, like so:

```ruby
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', person_properties: {'is_authorized': True})
```

You can pass symbols or strings, the library treats them the same.

The same holds for [groups](/manual/group-analytics). If you have a group name `organisation`, you can add properties like so:

```ruby
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', groups: {'organisation': 'google'}, group_properties: {'organisation': {'is_authorized': True})
# returns string or Nil
```

**Getting all flag values**

You can also get all known flag values as well. This is useful when you want to seed a frontend client with initial known flags. Like all methods above, this also takes optional person and group properties, if known.

```ruby
posthog.get_all_flags('distinct id', groups: {}, person_properties: {'is_authorized': True}, group_properties: {})
# returns hash of flag key and value pairs.
```

#### Feature Flag Payloads

Payloads allow you to retrieve a value that is associated with the matched flag. The value can be a
string, boolean, number, dictionary, or array. This allows for custom configurations based on values defined in the posthog app.

```ruby
posthog.get_feature_flag_payload('feature-flag-key', 'distinct id')
```

#### Local Evaluation

> **Note:** To enable local evaluation of feature flags you must also set a `personal_api_key` when configuring the integration, as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

> **Note:** This feature requires version 2.0 of the library, which in turn requires a minimum PostHog version of 1.38

> **Note:** A single local evaluation call is billed as equivalent to 10 `decide`requests. [More info](/docs/feature-flags/bootstrapping-and-local-evaluation#server-side-local-evaluation).

All feature flag evaluation requires an API request to your PostHog servers to get a response. However, where latency matters, you can evaluate flags locally. This is much faster, and requires two things to work:

1. The library must be initialised with a personal API key
2. You must know all person or group properties the flag depends on.

Then, the flag can be evaluated locally. The method signature looks exactly like above

```ruby
posthog.get_feature_flag('beta-feature', 'distinct id', person_properties: {'is_authorized': True})
# returns string or Nil
```

> **Note:** New feature flag definitions are polled every 30 seconds by default, which means there will be up to a 30 second delay between you changing the flag definition, and it reflecting on your servers. You can change this default on the client by setting `feature_flags_polling_interval = <value in seconds>`.

This works for `getAllFlags` as well. It evaluates all flags locally if possible. If even one flag isn't locally evaluable, it falls back to decide.

```ruby
posthog.get_all_flags('distinct id', groups: {}, person_properties: {'is_authorized': True}, group_properties: {})
# returns hash of flag key and value pairs.
```

**Restricting evaluation to local only**

Sometimes, performance might matter to you so much that you never want an HTTP request roundtrip delay when computing flags. In this case, you can set the `only_evaluate_locally` parameter to true, which tries to compute flags only with the properties it has. If it fails to compute a flag, it returns `None`, instead of going to PostHog's servers to get the value.

#### Evaluating feature flags locally in unicorn server

If you have `preload_app true` in your unicorn config, you can use `after_fork` [hook](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/unicorn/Unicorn%2FConfigurator:after_fork) which is part of the unicorn's configuration so that the feature flag cache will receive the updates from posthog dashboard.

```ruby
after_fork do |server, worker|
  $posthog = PostHog::Client.new(
    api_key: '<ph_project_api_key>',
    personal_api_key: '<ph_personal_api_key>'
    host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    on_error: Proc.new { |status, msg| print msg }
  )
end
```

#### Reloading feature flags

When initializing PostHog, you can configure the interval at which feature flags are polled (fetched from the server). However, if you need to force a reload, you can use `reloadFeatureFlags`:

```ruby
posthog.reload_feature_flags()

// Do something with feature flags here
```

### Experiments (A/B tests)

Since [experiments](/docs/experiments/manual) use feature flags, the code for running an experiment is very similar to the feature flags code:

```ruby
variant = posthog.get_feature_flag('experiment-feature-flag-key', 'user_distinct_id')

if variant == 'variant-name'
    # Do something 
end
```

It's also possible to [run experiments without using feature flags](/docs/experiments/running-experiments-without-feature-flags).

### Group analytics

Group analytics allows you to associate an event with a group (e.g. teams, organizations, etc.). Read the [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) guide for more information.

> **Note: ** This is a paid feature and is not available on the open-source or free cloud plan. Learn more [here](/pricing).

-   Capture an event and associate it with a group

```ruby
posthog.capture({
    distinct_id: 'distinct id',
    event: 'movie played',
    properties: {
        movie_id: '123',
        category: 'romcom'
    }
    groups: {
        'company': 'company_id_in_your_db'
    }
})
```

-   Update properties on a group

```ruby
posthog.group_identify(
  {
    group_type: "company",
    group_key: "company_id_in_your_db",
    properties: {
      name: "Awesome Inc."
    }
  }
)
```

The `name` is a special property which is used in the PostHog UI for the name of the Group. If you don't specify a `name` property, the group ID will be used instead.

## Thank you

This library is largely based on the `analytics-ruby` package.

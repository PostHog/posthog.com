HogQL expressions enable you to directly access, modify, and aggregate data in many places in PostHog including:

- Filters
- Trends series
- Breakdowns
- [Funnel](/docs/product-analytics/funnels) aggregations
- [User paths](/docs/product-analytics/paths)
- [Session replays](/docs/session-replay)
- [Dashboards](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards)
- The [activity tab](https://us.posthog.com/events)

> **Tip:** If you're having trouble getting results from your expression, try debugging by using a different visualization (trends table often works best as it shows all values returned) or breaking down your expression into pieces and testing each one.

## Accessible data

HogQL expressions can access data like:

- event properties
- [person properties](/docs/product-analytics/user-properties)
- `event`
- `elements_chain` (from autocapture)
- `timestamp`
- `distinct_id`
- `person_id`

Properties can be accessed with dot notation like `person.properties.$initial_browser` which also works for nested or JSON properties. They can also be accessed with bracket notation like `properties['$feature/cool-flag']`.

> **Note:** PostHog's properties always include `$` as a prefix, while custom properties do not (unless you add it).

Property identifiers must be known at query time. For dynamic access, use the JSON manipulation functions from below on the `properties` field directly.

### Types

Types (and names) for the accessible data can be found in the [database](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/database) and [properties](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/properties) tabs in data management. They include:

- `STRING` (default)
- `JSON` (accessible with dot or bracket notation)
- `DATETIME`(in `ISO-8601`, [read more in our data docs](/docs/data/timestamps))
- `INTEGER`
- `NUMERIC`(AKA float)
- `BOOLEAN`

Types can be converted using functions like `toString`, `toDate`, `toFloat`, `JSONExtractString`, `JSONExtractInt`, and more.

## Functions and aggregations

You can filter, modify, or aggregate accessed data with [supported ClickHouse functions](/docs/hogql/clickhouse-functions) like `dateDiff()` and `concat()` and [aggregations](/docs/hogql/aggregations) like `sumIf()` and `count()`.

Here are some of the most common and useful ones:

### Comparisons

- `if`: Checks a condition, and if true (or non-zero), and then returns the result of an expression.
- `multiIf`: Enables chaining multiple `if` statements together, each with a condition and return expression.
- `in`: Checks if an array or string contains a value.
- `match`: Checks whether a string matches a regular expression pattern.
- `like`: Checks if string matches pattern that contain string(s) and symbols `%` (arbitrary number of arbitrary characters), `_` (single arbitrary character), `\` (escaped literals).

### Aggregations

- `count`: Counts the values. If you want a condition, use `sumIf`.
- `count(distinct)`: Counts the number of `uniqExact` values.
- `uniq`: Calculates the approximate number of different values (`uniqExact` is slower but exact).
- `uniqExact`: Calculates the exact number of different argument values (`uniq` is faster and you should use it if a close approximation is good enough).
- `sum`: Calculates the total (sum) numeric value.
- `sumIf`: Calculates the total (sum) numeric value for values meeting a condition.
- `avg`: Calculates the average numeric value.
- `median`: Computes an approximate middle (50%) value for a numeric data sequence.

### Strings

- `extract`: Extracts a fragment of a string using a regular expression.
- `concat`: Concatenates strings listed without separator.
- `splitByChar`: Splits string into substrings separated by a specified character.
- `replaceOne`, `replaceRegexpOne`: Replace the first occurrence of matching a substring or regular expression pattern respectively with a replacement string.

### Dates

- `dateDiff('unit', startdate, enddate)`: Returns the count in `unit` between `startdate` and `enddate`.
- `toDayOfWeek`, `toHour`, `toMinute`: Converts date number of day of week (1-7), hour in 24-hour time (0-23), and minute in hour (0-59).
- `now()`, `today()`, `yesterday()`: Returns the current time, date, or yesterdayâ€™s date respectively.
- `interval`: A length of time for use in arithmetic operations with other dates and times.

## Use cases

- Checking if a property or autocapture element chain contains a specific value or any of an array of values using `in` or `match`.
- Modifying the display string in the visualization by extracting or concatenating properties using `concat()`, `+`, `extract()`, or `replaceOne`.
- Grouping or binning events based on properties using `if()`, `multiIf()`.
- Accessing nested properties such as `properties.$set.$geoip_city_name`.
- Filtering for events that happened in the last X minutes or hours with `dateDiff()`, `now()`, and `interval`.
- Creating percentages by calculating the sum of one property over the sum of all related properties with `sum()`, `/`, `+`, and `*`.
- Getting unique values with `uniq()`.
- Binning events based on time of day, week, and month with `toHour`, `toDayOfWeek`, `toStartOfWeek`, `toMonth`.
- Breaking down by multiple properties using `concat()`.

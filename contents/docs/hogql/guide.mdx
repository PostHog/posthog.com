## Strings and quotes

Quotation symbols work the same way they would work with ClickHouse, which inherits from ANSI SQL:

- **S**ingle quotes (`'`) for **S**trings literals.
- **D**ouble quotes (`"`) and **B**ackticks (\`) for **D**ata**B**ase identifiers.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM events WHERE properties.`$browser` = 'Chrome'
```

## Property access

To access a property stored on an event or person, just use dot notation. For example `properties.$browser` or `person.properties.$initial_browser`.  

Nested property or JSON access, such as `properties.$some.nested.property`, works as well.

> PostHog's properties include always include `$` as a prefix, while custom properties do not (unless you add it).

Property identifiers must be known at query time. For dynamic access, use the JSON manipulation functions from below on the `properties` field directly.

## Property types

If you have specified a type for an event or person property under "Data Management", it will be returned in this type. All other properties are returned as strings.

For example:

```sql
SELECT round(properties.$screen_width * properties.$screen_height / 1000000, 2) as `Screen MegaPixels` FROM events LIMIT 100
```

This works because `$screen_width` and `$screen_height` are both defined as numeric properties. Thus you can multiply them.

To cast a string property into a different type, use type conversion functions, such as `toFloat()`.

> You can find a full list of properties and their types in your [data management tab](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/properties).

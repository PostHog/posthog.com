The PostHog MCP lets v0 query your analytics data, investigate errors, manage feature flags, and run experiments - all through natural language.

## Connect PostHog to v0

1. In a v0 chat, click the **+** button in the bottom left
2. Click **MCPs**
3. Click **Add MCP**
4. Select **Custom MCP**
5. Enter the name `PostHog` and URL `https://mcp.posthog.com/mcp`
6. Under **Authentication**, select **OAuth**
7. Click **Add**, then authorize with PostHog when prompted

The PostHog MCP server is now available in your v0 chats.

If your PostHog project is on EU Cloud, use `https://mcp-eu.posthog.com/mcp` instead.

## Set up PostHog in your project

Once connected, give v0 this prompt to add PostHog with the Vercel Flags SDK:

```text
Add PostHog to this project for analytics and feature flags.

Use the PostHog MCP to:
- Get the project API token (from projects-get) → set as NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY
- Get the host URL → set as NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST

Install packages: @flags-sdk/posthog, @vercel/flags, posthog-js

Set up the Vercel Flags SDK with the PostHog adapter:
- Create flags.ts with the PostHog adapter configuration
- Use the adapter's identify() function for user identification

Create a PostHog provider at app/providers.tsx that:
- Initializes PostHog with autocapture: true, capture_pageview: false
- Uses env vars NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST
- Handles pageview tracking for Next.js app router

Wrap the app in the PostHog provider in app/layout.tsx.
```

The agent will get your project credentials from the MCP, install the Vercel Flags SDK with the PostHog adapter, and set up analytics.

For production, add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` - your project API token (MCP can provide this)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` - `https://us.i.posthog.com` or `https://eu.i.posthog.com`
- `FLAGS_SECRET` - generate with `node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"`

## What you can do with the MCP

Once connected, you can ask v0 to interact with your PostHog data directly:

### Query your analytics

**Prompt:** "How many unique users signed up in the last 7 days, broken down by day?"

The agent will run a trends query and return daily signup counts with a breakdown.

**Prompt:** "What's the conversion rate from signup to first purchase?"

The agent will build a funnel query and calculate the conversion percentage between those two events.

### Investigate errors

**Prompt:** "What are the top 5 errors in my project this week?"

The agent will fetch error groups sorted by occurrence count, including how many users were affected.

**Prompt:** "Show me details about the most recent TypeError"

The agent will pull the stack trace, affected users, and browser/OS context for that error.

### Manage feature flags

**Prompt:** "Create a feature flag called 'new-checkout' enabled for 10% of users"

The agent will create the flag with a 10% rollout and return the configuration with a link to the flag in PostHog.

**Prompt:** "Update the 'beta-features' flag to 50% rollout"

The agent will modify the existing flag and confirm the new rollout percentage.

### Run experiments

**Prompt:** "Create an A/B test for the pricing page that measures conversion to checkout"

The agent will set up an experiment with control/test variants and configure a funnel metric measuring pricing page to checkout conversion.

See [all available MCP tools](/docs/model-context-protocol#available-tools) for the complete list.

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth not refreshing

If the OAuth token expires and won't refresh, you can use a personal API key instead:

1. Create a [personal API key](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) with the **MCP Server** preset
2. In v0, go to **Manage MCPs** and edit the PostHog connection
3. Change authentication to **Bearer** and enter your API key

### MCP not connecting

Try disconnecting and reconnecting the PostHog MCP server. Make sure you're logged into the correct PostHog account.

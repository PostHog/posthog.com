The PostHog MCP lets v0 query your analytics data, investigate errors, manage feature flags, and run experiments - all through natural language.

## Connect PostHog to v0

1. In a v0 chat, click the **+** button in the bottom left
2. Click **MCPs**
3. Click **Add MCP**
4. Select **Custom MCP**
5. Enter the name `PostHog` and URL `https://mcp.posthog.com/mcp`
6. Under **Authentication**, select **OAuth**
7. Click **Add**, then authorize with PostHog when prompted

The PostHog MCP server is now available in your v0 chats.

If your PostHog project is on EU Cloud, use `https://mcp-eu.posthog.com/mcp` instead.

## What you can do with the MCP

Once connected, you can ask v0 to interact with your PostHog data directly:

### Query your analytics

**Prompt:** "How many unique users signed up in the last 7 days, broken down by day?"

The agent will run a trends query and return daily signup counts with a breakdown.

**Prompt:** "What's the conversion rate from signup to first purchase?"

The agent will build a funnel query and calculate the conversion percentage between those two events.

### Investigate errors

**Prompt:** "What are the top 5 errors in my project this week?"

The agent will fetch error groups sorted by occurrence count, including how many users were affected.

**Prompt:** "Show me details about the most recent TypeError"

The agent will pull the stack trace, affected users, and browser/OS context for that error.

### Manage feature flags

**Prompt:** "Create a feature flag called 'new-checkout' enabled for 10% of users"

The agent will create the flag with a 10% rollout and return the configuration with a link to the flag in PostHog.

**Prompt:** "Update the 'beta-features' flag to 50% rollout"

The agent will modify the existing flag and confirm the new rollout percentage.

### Run experiments

**Prompt:** "Create an A/B test for the pricing page that measures conversion to checkout"

The agent will set up an experiment with control/test variants and configure a funnel metric measuring pricing page to checkout conversion.

See [all available MCP tools](/docs/model-context-protocol#available-tools) for the complete list.

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth not refreshing

If the OAuth token expires and won't refresh, you can use a personal API key instead:

1. Create a [personal API key](https://us.posthog.com/settings/user-api-keys) with the **MCP Server** preset
2. In v0, go to **Manage MCPs** and edit the PostHog connection
3. Change authentication to **Bearer** and enter your API key

### MCP not connecting

Try disconnecting and reconnecting the PostHog MCP server. Make sure you're logged into the correct PostHog account.

<Step title="Create a new messaging channel" badge="required">

Before you can design a campaign, you need to configure a messaging channel. Campaigns use messaging channels to deliver messages to your users.

To create a new channel, go to messaging > [**Channels** tab](https://app.posthog.com/messaging/channels) > click **+ New channel**, and select the channel you want to configure:

<Tab.Group tabs={[
'Email', 
'Slack', 
'Twilio']}>
<Tab.List>
<Tab>Email</Tab>
<Tab>Slack</Tab>
<Tab>Twilio</Tab>
</Tab.List>
<Tab.Panels>

Email is the default messaging channel in PostHog.  

You can use it to send **[drip campaigns](/tutorials/email-drip-campaign), transactional messages, or announcements** directly from the Campaign Builder.

### Configure the channel

To configure the channel, you need to provide the following details:

- Enter your **from name** (e.g. `PostHog Team`).
- Enter your **from email** (e.g. `team@yourdomain.com`).

This is the address that recipients will see in their inbox.

### Verify your domain

To maximize deliverability and avoid spam folders, you must verify your domain.

1. After adding your email address, PostHog shows DNS records for **SPF** and **DKIM**.
2. Copy these into your domain host (e.g. Cloudflare, GoDaddy).
3. Verification may take a few minutes to propagate.

Once verified, you'll see a green check mark in your settings.

<Step title="Create a template" badge="required">

Navigate to **Messaging** > **Templates** tab > click **+ Create new**.

- Give your template a name.
- Write your subject line and body content (HTML and text versions are supported).
- Use variables like `{{ person.name }}` to personalize your message.

Save your template — you'll be able to select it later when you design a campaign.

</Step>

<Step title="Test your setup" badge="required">

Before going live, send a test message:

- In the template editor, click **Send test**.
- Choose your own user profile (must have a valid email property).
- Confirm the email arrives as expected.

</Step>

<Step title="Use in a campaign" badge="required">

1. Open the Campaign Builder.
2. Drag an **Email** step into your workflow.
3. Select the template you created.
4. Connect it to your trigger and other steps.

Once published, users who reach this step will receive your email.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- **Emails not sending?**  
  Check that your domain is verified and you’ve added the DNS records correctly.

- **Spam folder issues?**  
  Ensure SPF/DKIM are valid, and consider setting up DMARC.

- **Variables not populating?**  
  Confirm the property exists on the person profile (e.g. `person.name`).

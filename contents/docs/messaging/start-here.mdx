Messaging is PostHog's no-code drag-and-drop tool for building automated campaigns.
Think of it as a way to communicate with your users â€“ you decide which users should receive which messages, when, and through which channel.

Before you can launch a campaign, you need to configure a messaging channel:

The [campaign builder](/docs/messaging/campaign-builder) is a powerful, no-code tool for building campaigns.

Campaigns are made up of the following building blocks:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Triggers](/docs/messaging/triggers) | What starts the campaign. We let you start a campaign when an event is performed (e.g. a user signs up), or programmatically via a webhook. |
| [Actions](/docs/messaging/actions) | The messages you send, mail, slack, SMS, webhook, or any PostHog real time destinations. |
| [Delays](/docs/messaging/delays) | Wait steps such as "wait 2 days" or "wait until condition is true." |
| [Audience splits](/docs/messaging/audience-splits) | Target and split the users you message with more specificity or try a/b testing with random branching. |
| [PostHog actions](/docs/messaging/posthog-actions) | Change a person's properties, or trigger other events, once a person reaches a specific point in your campaign. |

Familiarize yourself with these components to explore the full power of the campaign builder.

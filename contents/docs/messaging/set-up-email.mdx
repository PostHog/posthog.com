## Introduction

Email is the default messaging channel in PostHog.  
You can use it to send **drip campaigns, transactional messages, or announcements** directly from the Campaign Builder.

Before you can send your first campaign, you need to:

1. Configure your sending domain and address.
2. Verify your domain (SPF/DKIM).
3. Create an email template.

---

## Step 1: Add a sending address

Go to **Messaging → Settings → Email**.

- Enter your **from name** (e.g. `PostHog Team`).
- Enter your **from email** (e.g. `team@yourdomain.com`).

This is the address that recipients will see in their inbox.

---

## Step 2: Verify your domain

To maximize deliverability and avoid spam folders, you must verify your domain.

1. After adding your email address, PostHog shows DNS records for **SPF** and **DKIM**.
2. Copy these into your domain host (e.g. Cloudflare, GoDaddy).
3. Verification may take a few minutes to propagate.

Once verified, you’ll see a green check mark in your settings.

---

## Step 3: Create a template

Navigate to **Messaging → Templates → Create new**.

- Give your template a name.
- Write your subject line and body content (HTML and text versions are supported).
- Use variables like `{{ person.name }}` to personalize.

Save your template — you’ll be able to select it when adding an Email step in a campaign.

---

## Step 4: Test your setup

Before going live, send a test email:

- In the template editor, click **Send test**.
- Choose your own user profile (must have a valid email property).
- Confirm the email arrives as expected.

---

## Step 5: Use in a campaign

1. Open the Campaign Builder.
2. Drag an **Email** step into your workflow.
3. Select the template you created.
4. Connect it to your trigger and other steps.

Once published, users who reach this step will receive your email.

## Troubleshooting

- **Emails not sending?**  
  Check that your domain is verified and you’ve added the DNS records correctly.

- **Spam folder issues?**  
  Ensure SPF/DKIM are valid, and consider setting up DMARC.

- **Variables not populating?**  
  Confirm the property exists on the person profile (e.g. `person.name`).

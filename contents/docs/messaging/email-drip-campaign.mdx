In this guide we’ll walk through creating a simple **drip campaign**:  
send a welcome email when a user signs up, then follow up 1 day later if they don't have a property set.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a campaign" badge="required">

Go to **Messaging** and click the ** `+ New campaign` button**.  

![click-button](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/messaging_empty_state_7a76cee4f6.png)

You’ll see a trigger block connected to an exit.

You can see that the trigger is not set because it has a little exclamation mark.

</Step>

<Step title="Set the trigger" badge="required">

Click on the trigger, there will be a warning that an event is required.

![trigger-unset](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/trigger_unset_ea39720d30.png)

Click the `add trigger event` button

![select](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/select_trigger_event_b6c080df9d.png)

Then search for your signup event (`user signed up`) and click it. It should look something like:

![Trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/trigger_event_74ae2e44d9.png)

Don't worry about the conversion goal or exit conditions for now, and exit this step by clicking on the back arrow in the sidepanel - this is how you will exit any step after configuring it.

</Step>

<Step title="Send the first email" badge="required">

Drag an **Email** action beneath the trigger, into the campaign like this:
![drag](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/drag_email_07b4d22856.png)

The unconfigured email step will look like this:

You will need to set the subject line, and the sender:
![subj]()

And also select your welcome email template or create a new one, and then click out.

</Step>

<Step title="Wait until condition branch" badge="required">

After the email, add a **Wait until Condition branch**.  

By default there will be 1 branch, so add one more by clicking on then the `add filter` button.

For the `add filter` branch set the condition so that "`onboarding_completed = true`"

For the wait time make it 1 day.

This means if after 1 day the onbaording_completed person property is not set to true, then go down `no match` the branch, otherwise the condition matches, and we proceed down the `if condition matches` branch

![Wait](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/wait_until_cond_50ec1f7eea.png)

## Step 5: Follow up email or exit

We now drag one more email to the `no match` branch of the `wait until condition`

![next](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/next_email_ebb71d38d8.png)

This means:

- **Yes branch:** Exit (they’ve already activated).
- **No branch:** Add another Email step with a follow-up.

</Step>

<Step title="Review and launch" badge="required">

Now the campaign should look like this ![this](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/complete_onboarding_workflow_09c6e2c6ad.png)

Click **Create**, and voila the campaign is published.

Your new users will now automatically receive the drip sequence!

In this guide we’ll walk through creating a simple **drip campaign**:  
send a welcome email when a user signs up, then follow up 1 day later if they haven't completed onboarding.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a campaign" badge="required">

Go to **Messaging** and click the ** `+ New campaign` button**.  

![click-button](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/messaging_empty_state_7a76cee4f6.png)

You’ll see a trigger block connected to an exit.

![fresh](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/fresh_campaign_aeecc715f2.png)

You can see that the trigger is not set because it has a little exclamation mark.

</Step>

<Step title="Set the trigger" badge="required">

Click on the trigger, there will be a warning that an event is required.

![trigger-unset](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/trigger_unset_ea39720d30.png)

Click the `add trigger event` button

![select](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/select_trigger_event_b6c080df9d.png)

Then search for your signup event (`user signed up`) and click it. It should look something like:

![Trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/trigger_event_74ae2e44d9.png)

Don't worry about the conversion goal or exit conditions for now, and exit this step by clicking on the back arrow in the sidepanel - this is how you will exit any step after configuring it.

</Step>

<Step title="Send the first email" badge="required">

Drag an **Email** action beneath the trigger, into the campaign like this:
![drag](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/drag_email_07b4d22856.png)

The unconfigured email step will look like this:
![unconf](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/unconfigured_email_b091c33ab4.png)

You will need to set the subject line, and the sender:
![subj](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/set_subject_sender_1904934c7e.png)

And also select your welcome email template or create a new one, and then click out.

</Step>

<Step title="Wait until condition branch" badge="required">

This is where things get interesting. We will want to send a follow up email **only** to those users who have `not completed onboarding`. We can achieve this with a `wait until condition` step.

After the email, add a **Wait until Condition**.  

![wu-first](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/wu_first_00937c435b.png)

By default there will be 1 branch that is configured, the wait time. In the campaign builder the wait time corresponds to the `no match` branch:

![one-branch-conf](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/one_branch_conf_a2814aaaf0.png)

So we need to configure the `if condition matches` branch, by clicking on the `add filter` button, and setting it. 

Specifically we need to set a `person property` here (not an event property) so search for the person property related to onboarding like this:

![search_prop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/search_prop_584e043a77.png)

Then set the condition so that `onboarding_completed = true`

![set_prop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/set_prop_1dd69a088b.png)

For the wait time make it 1 day.

This means if after 1 day the onbaording_completed person property is not set to true, then go down the `no match` branch, otherwise the condition matches, and we proceed down the `if condition matches` branch

![Wait](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/wait_until_cond_50ec1f7eea.png)

## Step 5: Follow up email or exit

We now drag one more email to the `no match` branch of the `wait until condition`

![next](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/next_email_ebb71d38d8.png)

This means:

- Exit the campaign if their person property `first_onboarding_complete` is set to `true` (they’ve already activated).
- Receive another Email step with a follow-up, if they have not completed onboarding!

</Step>

<Step title="Review and launch" badge="required">

Now the complete campaign should look like this ![this](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/complete_onboarding_workflow_09c6e2c6ad.png)

Click **Create**, and voila the campaign is published.

Your new users will now automatically receive the drip campaign!

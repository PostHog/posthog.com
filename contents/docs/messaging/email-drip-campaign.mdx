In this guide we'll walk through creating a simple **drip campaign**. After following this guide, you will:
- Send a welcome email when a user signs up
- Follow up 1 day later if they haven't completed onboarding

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a campaign" badge="required">

Go to **Messaging** and click the **+ New campaign button**.

/>

You'll see a trigger block connected to an exit.

/>

You can see that the trigger is not set because it has a little exclamation mark.

</Step>

<Step title="Set the trigger" badge="required">

Click on the trigger, there will be a warning that an event is required.

    alt="Trigger warning that event is required"
/>

Click the `add trigger event` button

    classes="rounded"
    alt="Select trigger event button"
/>

Then search for your signup event (`user signed up`) and click it. It should look something like:

    classes="rounded"
    alt="Trigger event configuration"
/>

Don't worry about the conversion goal or exit conditions for now, and exit this step by clicking on the back arrow in the sidepanel - this is how you will exit any step after configuring it.

/>

</Step>

<Step title="Send the first email" badge="required">

Drag an **Email** action beneath the trigger, into the campaign like this:

    classes="rounded"
    alt="Dragging email action"
/>

The unconfigured email step will look like this:

    classes="rounded"
    alt="Unconfigured email step"
/>

You will need to set the subject line, and the sender:

    classes="rounded"
    alt="Setting subject line and sender"
/>

And also select your welcome email template or create a new one, and then click out.

    alt="Email template selection"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Wait until condition branch" badge="required">

This is where things get interesting. We will want to send a follow up email **only** to those users who have `not completed onboarding`. We can achieve this with a `wait until condition` step.

After the email, add a **Wait until Condition**.  

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/wu_first_00937c435b.png"
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Adding wait until condition"
/>

By default there will be 1 branch that is configured, the wait time. In the campaign builder the wait time corresponds to the `no match` branch:

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/one_branch_conf_a2814aaaf0.png"
    classes="rounded"
    alt="One branch configuration"
/>

So we need to configure the `if condition matches` branch, by clicking on the `add filter` button, and setting it. 

Specifically we need to set a `person property` here (not an event property) so search for the person property related to onboarding like this:

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/search_prop_584e043a77.png"
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Searching person property"
/>

Then set the condition so that `onboarding_completed = true`

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/set_prop_1dd69a088b.png"
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Setting property condition"
/>

For the wait time make it 1 day.

This means if after 1 day the onbaording_completed person property is not set to true, then go down the `no match` branch, otherwise the condition matches, and we proceed down the `if condition matches` branch

    classes="rounded"
    alt="Wait until condition configuration"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Add follow up email" badge="required">

For users who haven't completed onboarding after the wait period, we'll send a follow-up email. Drag an email action to the `no match` branch of the `wait until condition`.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/next_email_ebb71d38d8.png"
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Adding follow up email"
/>

Configure this email with content encouraging them to complete onboarding. Some tips:

- Keep it short and focused
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Highlight the value they'll get from completing onboarding
- Consider offering help or support

The campaign will now:
- Exit if their person property `first_onboarding_complete` is set to `true` (they've completed onboarding)
- Send the follow-up email if they have not completed onboarding after the wait period

</Step>

<Step title="Review and launch" badge="required">

Now the complete campaign should look like this:

    alt="Complete campaign workflow"
/>

Click **Create** to publish the campaign. Your new users will now automatically receive this drip campaign to help guide them through onboarding.

The Campaign Builder is where you design workflows.  
Each campaign is made up of:

- **Triggers** – define when users enter the campaign.
- **Actions** – send an email or push data to any CDP destination (e.g. Slack, SMS, Webhook).
- **Delays** – wait a certain time or until a condition is met.
- **Audience splits** – branch logic for personalization.

### Triggers

- **Event trigger** – a user performs an action (e.g. `signed up`).
- **Attribute trigger** – a user has a property.
- **Time-based** – specific time window or delay.

### Actions

- **Email** – send an email natively through PostHog.
- **CDP destinations** – use any configured destination as a messaging step.
- **Webhook** – call external systems.

### Delays

- **Delay** – fixed wait (hours/days).
- **Wait until condition** – e.g. user has property, performed event.
- **Wait until time window** – e.g. only send on weekdays 9-5.

### Audience split

- **Conditional branch** – segment by property/event.
- **Random branch** – experiment or A/B test.

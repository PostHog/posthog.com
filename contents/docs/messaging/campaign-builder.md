The Campaign Builder is where you design workflows.  
Each campaign is made up of:

- **A Trigger** – what starts the campaign. We let you start a campaign when an event if performed (e.g. a user signs up), or programmatically via a webhook.
- **Actions** – the messages you send, Email, Slack, SMS, Webhook, or any PostHog [real time destinations](/docs/cdp/destinations).
- **Delays** – wait steps such as "wait 2 days" or "wait until condition is true."
- **Audience splits** – Target and split the users you message with more specificity or try a/b testing with random branching.
- **PostHog Actions** - Change a person's properties, or trigger other events, once a person reaches a specific point in your campaign.

A campaign always starts with a trigger and ends with an exit, but you can add as much logic in between as you like.

### Triggers

- **Event trigger** – a user performs an action (e.g. `signed up`).
- **Webhook trigger** – programmatically start a campaign with a webhook

### Actions

- **Email** – send an email natively through PostHog.
- **Slack** - send a message to a slack channel.
- **Webhook** – call external systems.
- **CDP destinations** – use any configured destination as a messaging step.

### Delays

- **Delay** – fixed wait (minutes/hours/days).
- **Wait until condition** – e.g. wait until user has property set to a specific value.
- **Wait until time window** – e.g. only send on weekdays 9-5.

### Audience split

- **Conditional branch** – segment by property/event.
- **Random branch** – experiment or A/B test.


### PostHog Actions

- **Capture Event** - Trigger posthog events when users get to specific points in your campaign. This can be a useful way to chain campagins together, or track the effectiveness of campaigns in analytics dashboards.
- **Update Person Properties** - Set a specific person property, or create a new one. This can be a useful way to chain campagins together.

If a user logs out on your frontend, you should call `reset` to unlink any future events made on that device with that user. 

This is important if your users are sharing a computer, as otherwise all of those users are grouped together into a single user due to shared cookies between sessions. **We strongly recommend you call `reset` on logout even if you don't expect users to share a computer.**

You can do that like so:

<MultiLanguage selector="tabs">

```js-web
posthog.reset()
```

```iOS
posthog.reset()
```
```Android
PostHog.with(this)
       .reset();
```

</MultiLanguage>

If you _also_ want to reset the `device_id` so that the device will be considered a new device in future events, you can pass `true` as an argument:

<MultiLanguage selector="tabs">

```js-web
posthog.reset(true)
```

```iOS
posthog.reset(true)
```

```Android
PostHog.with(this)
       .reset(true);
```
</MultiLanguage>

In the same way that every person can have [properties](/docs/getting-started/person-properties) associated with them, every group can have properties associated with it.

Continuing with the previous example of using `company` as our group type, we'll add `company_name`, `date_joined`, and `subscription` as additional properties.

> **Note:** You must include at least one group property for a group to be visible in the [People and groups tab](https://app.posthog.com/persons).

// Option 1 (recommended): Set properties in posthog.group()
// This has the side-effect that all subsequent events in the session are associated to the group
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db', {
    name: 'PostHog',
    subscription: "subscription",
    date_joined: '2020-01-23'

// Option 2: 
// Set properties in posthog.capture()

Properties on groups behave in the same way as properties on [persons](/docs/data/persons). They can also be used within experiments and feature flags to rollout features to specific groups.

> **Note:** The PostHog UI identifies a group using the `name` property. If the `name` property is not found, it falls back to the group key.

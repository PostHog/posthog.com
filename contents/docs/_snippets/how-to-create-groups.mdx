Groups are created and defined in your code when sending events. 

In the example below, we create a group type `company`. Then, for each company, we set the `group key` as the unique identifier for that specific company. This can be anything that helps you identify it, such as ID or domain.

> We advise against using the _name_ of the company (or any other group) as the key, because that's rarely guaranteed to be unique, and thus can affect the quality of analytics data.

```js
// All events for that session will be associated with company `company_id_on_your_db`
posthog.group('company', 'company_id_in_your_db');

posthog.capture('user_signed_up')
```

```python
posthog.capture('[distinct id]', 'user_signed_up', groups={'company': 'company_id_in_your_db'})
```

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "[distinct id]",
    Event: "user_signed_up",
    Groups: posthog.NewGroups().
        Set("company", "company_id_in_your_db").
})
```

```node
posthog.capture({
    event: 'user_signed_up',
    distinctId: '[distinct id]',
    groups: { company: 'company_id_in_your_db' }
})
```

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => '[distinct id]',
    'event' => 'user_signed_up',
    '$groups' => array("company" => "company_id_in_your_db")
));
```

```segment
// You'll always need to pass through the $groups object for Segment, even for analytics.js
analytics.track('user_signed_up', {
    $groups: { segment_group: 'company_id_in_your_db' }
})

```bash
curl -v -L --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "api_key": "<ph_project_api_key>",
    "event": "user_signed_up",
    "distinct_id": "[distinct id]",
    "properties": {
        "$groups": {"company": "company_id_in_your_db"}
    }
}' <ph_instance_address>/capture/

> **Tip:** When specifying the group type, use the singular version for clarity (`company` instead of `companies`).

We now have one `company`-type group with a key `company_id_in_your_db`. When we send the event `user_signed_up`, it will be attached to this newly created group.

A single event can only belong to a single group per group type. To elaborate what we mean, we'll continue using the example above:

* It is **NOT** possible to assign the a single `user_signed_up` event to two companies at the same time.
* It is possible to assign this event to a different group type, for example `channel` or `post`, in addition to the `company` group type.

**Groups** are a powerful feature in PostHog that aggregate events based on entities, such as organizations or companies. They enable you to analyze trends, insights, and dashboards at an entity-level, as opposed to a user-level.

To clarify what we mean, let's look at a few examples:

1. For B2B SaaS apps, you can create a **company** group type. This enables you to aggregate events at a company-level, and calculate metrics such as `number of daily active companies`, `company churn rate`, or `how many companies have adopted a new feature`.

2. For collaborative, project-based apps like Notion, Jira, or Figma, you can create a **project** group type. This enables you to calculate metrics like `project pageviews`, `users per project`, and `project engagement`.

3. For a communication app like Slack, you can create a **channel** group type. This enables you to measure metrics like `average number of messages per channel`, `number of monthly active channels`, or `total number of channel participants`.

4. For a social media app like Twitter, you can create a **post** group type. This enables you to measure `average number of replies per post`, or `total count of unique posters per month`.

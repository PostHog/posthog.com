When a user starts browsing your website or app, PostHog automatically assigns them an **anonymous ID**, which is stored locally. This enables us to track anonymous users â€“ even across different sessions.

> **Note:** depending on your [persistence configuration](/docs/libraries/js#persistence), the anonymous ID may not be stored, and thus regenerated across sessions.

By calling `identify` with a `distinct_id` of your choice (usually the user's ID in your database, or their email), you link the anonymous ID and distinct ID together.

Thus all past and future events made with that anonymous ID are now associated with the distinct ID. This enables you to do things like associate events with a user from before they log in for the first time, or associate their events across different devices or platforms.

> **Using `identify` in the backend:**
>
> Although it is technically possible to call `identify` using our backend SDKs, it is typically most useful in frontends. This is because there is no concept of anonymous sessions in the backend SDKs.

When a user starts browsing your website or app, PostHog automatically assigns them an **anonymous ID**, which is stored locally. 

Provided you've [configured persistence](/docs/libraries/js/persistence) to use cookies or `localStorage`, this enables us to track anonymous users â€“ even across different sessions.

By calling `identify` with a `distinct_id` of your choice (usually the user's ID in your database, or their email), you link the anonymous ID and distinct ID together.

Thus, all past and future events made with that anonymous ID are now associated with the distinct ID. 

This enables you to do things like associate events with a user from before they log in for the first time, or associate their events across different devices or platforms.

  <summary>Using `identify` in the backend</summary>

  Although you can call `identify` using our backend SDKs, it is used most in frontends. This is because there is no concept of anonymous sessions in the backend SDKs, so calling `identify` only updates person profiles.

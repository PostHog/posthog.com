Building on the examples above, here are a few things you can do with groups:

1. Track how **companies** progress through your B2B product's activation steps. For example, you can create a [funnel](/docs/product-analytics/funnels) to see:
   - How many companies signed up this month.
   - What percentage completed the onboarding flow.
   - What percentage of new companies interacted with specific features at least once.

2. If you're building a Slack-like app, you can measure [retention](/docs/product-analytics/retention) of new features by specific **channels**. For example:
   - Which channels consistently use the video calling feature.
   - How many channels remain active month over month.
   - Compare feature adoption rates between different types of channels (e.g., team channels vs project channels).

3. For collaborative, project-based apps like Jira, you can target [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) at a project-level. For example, let's say you've refactored your codebase. You can target the new codebase to only a few projects and measure the impact on performance and errors metrics. Once you've gathered feedback, you can expand to the rest of your projects.

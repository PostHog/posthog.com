You'll notice that one of the parameters in the `identify` method is a `properties` object. This enables you to set [user properties](/docs/getting-started/user-properties). Whenever possible, we recommend passing in all user properties you have available each time you call identify, as this ensures their user profile on PostHog is up to date.

User properties can also be set using a `capture` and not only with `identify`. See our [user properties docs](/docs/getting-started/user-properties) for more details on how to work with them and best practices.

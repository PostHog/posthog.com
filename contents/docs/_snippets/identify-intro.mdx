Linking events to specific users enables you to build a full picture of how they're using your product across different sessions, devices, and platforms. 

This is straightforward to do when [capturing backend events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events?tab=Node.js), as you associate events to a specific user using a `distinct_id`, which is a required argument. 

However, in the frontend of a [web](/docs/libraries/js/features#capturing-events) or [mobile app](/docs/libraries/ios#capturing-events), a `distinct_id` is not a required argument â€” PostHog's SDKs will generate an anonymous `distinct_id` for you automatically and you can capture events anonymously, provided you use the appropriate [configuration](/docs/libraries/js/features#capturing-anonymous-events).

To link events to specific users, call `identify`:

import IdentifyFrontendCode from "./identify-frontend-code.mdx"

<IdentifyFrontendCode />

Events captured after calling `identify` are identified events and this creates a person profile if one doesn't exist already.

Due to the cost of processing them, anonymous events can be up to 4x cheaper than identified events, so it's recommended you only capture identified events when needed.

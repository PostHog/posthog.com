Linking events to specific users enables you to gain full insights as to how they're using your product across different sessions, devices, and platforms. 

This is straight forward to do when [capturing backend events](/docs/getting-started/send-events#3-capture-backend-events), as you associate events to a specific user using `distinct_id`, which is a required argument. However, on the [frontend](/docs/getting-started/send-events#sending-custom-properties-on-an-event), a `distinct_id` is not a required argument and thus events can be submitted anonymously. To link events from anonymous to specific users, you need to use `identify`:

```js-web
posthog.identify(
  'distinct_id',  // Replace 'distinct_id' with your user's unique identifier
  { email: 'max@hedgehogmail.com', name: 'Max Hedgehog' } 
);
```

```Android
PostHog.with(this)
     .identify(distinctID, new Properties() // Replace 'distinctID' with your user's unique identifier
        .putValue("name", "Max Hedgehog")
        .putValue("email", "max@hedgehogmail.com));
```


```iOS
posthog.identify("distinct_id", // Replace "distinct_id" with your user's unique identifier
  properties: ["name": "Max Hedgehog", "email": "max@hedgehogmail.com"])
```

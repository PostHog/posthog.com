Linking events to specific users enables you to build a full picture of how they're using your product across different sessions, devices, and platforms. 

This is straightforward to do when [capturing backend events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events?tab=Node.js), as you associate events to a specific user using `distinct_id`, which is a required argument. However, on the [frontend](/docs/getting-started/send-events#sending-custom-properties-on-an-event), a `distinct_id` is not a required argument and you can capture events anonymously. 

To link events to specific users, call `identify`:

import IdentifyFrontendCode from "./identify-frontend-code.mdx"

<IdentifyFrontendCode />

Events captured after calling `identify` are identified events and this creates a person profile if one doesn't exist already.

Under our current [pricing](/pricing), anonymous events can be up to 4x cheaper than identified events (due to the cost of processing them), so it's recommended you only capture identified events when needed.

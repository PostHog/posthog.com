You'll notice that one of the parameters in the `identify` method is a `properties` object. This enables you to set [person properties](/docs/getting-started/person-properties). Whenever possible, we recommend passing in all person properties you have available each time you call identify, as this ensures their person profile on PostHog is up to date.

Person properties can also be set using a `capture` and not only with `identify`. See our [person properties docs](/docs/getting-started/person-properties) for more details on how to work with them and best practices.

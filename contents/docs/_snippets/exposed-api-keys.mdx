It is **ok** for your **project API key** (starts with `phc_`) to be public. It is used to initialize PostHog, capture events, evaluate feature flags, and more, but doesn't have access to your private data.

It is **not recommended** for your **personal API key** (starts with `phx_`) to be public as it enables reading and writing potentially private data.

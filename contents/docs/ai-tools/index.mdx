We want to make it as easy as possible for you to get the most out of PostHog using AI.

Here's a list of the AI products we're working on right now:

### Max AI assistant

Max is an AI-powered product analyst and assistant that lives in PostHog. Max can:

- Research answers to product questions by querying the data.
- Get things done quickly in the PostHog UI for you (such as updating filters).
- Tell you all about PostHog features and how to use them (based on our docs).
- Chit-chat about anything really.

### AI installation wizard

Install PostHog in seconds with our wizard by only running a command in your terminal!

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

PostHog provides an MCP server. You can use this to connect your favourite AI tools (such as [Claude](https://claude.ai/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)) directly with your PostHog project and the PostHog docs.

### LLM observability
LLM observability gives you x-ray vision into your LLM applications. Here's what you can track:

- Every conversation (inputs, outputs, and tokens)
- Model performance (cost, latency and error rates)
- Full traces for when you need to go detective mode
- How much each chat/user/organization is costing you

The best part? All this data gets sent as regular PostHog events, where you can slice, dice, and analyze it in
dashboards, insights, and alerts.
And because we charge the same as regular PostHog events, it's roughly 10x cheaper than other [LLM observability tools](/blog/best-open-source-llm-observability-tools).

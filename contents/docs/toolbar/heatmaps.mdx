Heatmaps is a feature in the toolbar that shows you how users are interacting with elements on your website or app. 

To view your heatmaps, click the heatmap icon on the toolbar.

There are three kinds of heatmap in the toolbar:

1. heatmaps: which capture mouse movements, clicks, and rageclicks and shows you a heatmap of these interactions.
2. the scroll map: which shows you how far users are scrolling down your page.
3. the OG heatmap: which is really a "click map". It uses autocapture to show you where users are clicking on your website.

> **Note:** To use the click map, [autocapture](/docs/data/autocapture) must be enabled. 

# Heatmaps

You can enable heatmaps in project settings or as config to posthog-js. The heatmap data shows where on the page users are clicking, rageclicking, or moving their mouse. Unlike the clickmap, the user doesn't have to be clicking on a clickable element, so you can see where users are trying to click but can't.

> **Note:** Heatmap events are sent along with other events, so they don't contribute to your bill. It's best to have autocapture or pageleave events enabled to make sure all heatmap data is gathered.

### Aggregation

The heatmap can show a count of events or of unique users. The default is to show the count of events.

> **Note:** The unique users count is based on the user's distinct ID, so if a user is using multiple devices or browsers, they will be counted as multiple users. This is so that the heatmap can be much faster to load. The clickmap can be used when you want exact counts.

### Viewport accuracy

You can set a tolerance for the viewport accuracy. You might be viewing the heatmap on a different sized screen from your users. You can reduce viewport accuracy to include events from different sized screens. 

This means that you'll get more data but the position might not be as accurate.

### Color palette

The default palette for the heatmap is a gradient from red to green. This won't be visible for all users or against all site color themes. You can change the color palette to a different gradient or to a single color.

### Fixed positioning

Some clicks will be on elements that don't move when the page scrolls. PostHog JS will attempt to detect fixed elements such as headers or modals and will therefore show those heatmap areas, ignoring the scroll value. 

You can change fixed positioning so these clicks move when scrolled or hide them entirely.

# Scrollmaps

The scrollmap uses data from pageview and pageleave events to show how far down the page users are scrolling.

# Combining maps from similar pages using wildcards

If you have similar pages that are mostly the same but have dynamic content based on an identifier in the URL (e.g., product pages on an ecommerce site), you can search and display their combined heatmap using wildcards `*` in the heatmap menu.

For example, if the product pages on an ecommerce site use a URL format of `https://yourwebsite.com/products/product-id`, you can use the wildcard URL `https://yourwebsite.com/products/*` to display a combined heatmap from all the product pages.

# The Clickmap

With the clickmap on, clickable elements on your website will have a red overlay with numbers on them. Here's an example of our website with the heatmap enabled:

![An example from the PostHog website showing the click map highlighting a number of page elements. Some showing a count of clicks and one also showing a rage-click](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/tutorials/toolbar/posthog-heatmap-example.png)

Each number in the top right box of each element represents the total number of clicks in the last 7 days. The number in the top left of the element is the number of rage-clicks.

Numbers at the bottom or top of the screen indicate that there are more elements that are not currently being displayed on the page.

## How to create an action from the clickmap

Once you have enabled the clickmap, click on any element. You will then be able to create an [action](/docs/data/actions) from it.

## Loading more data

If you have many events, you may need to load more data to see everything on the clickmap. To do this, click on the load more button in the clickmap menu.

## Matching links by their target URL

By default, the toolbar matches clicks using the elements on the page, and not by their target URLs (i.e., `href` attribute). This is fine for most scenarios where you have static elements with the same target URL. However, this may not be ideal for dynamic lists that have different target URLs depending on the underlying data.

For example, consider the following screenshot of a list of elements for "Newly seen persons" from the PostHog app:

![the list of recent insights showing several clicks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/products/product-analytics/heatmaps-target-url-off.png)

The "Newly seen persons" shows the most recent list of persons using the app and is constantly being updated as new users use the app. In the clickmap, we see 106 clicks for the **first element**. This doesn't mean that the this specific person in the list received 106 clicks, but rather that the first element in the list received 106 clicks, regardless of which person was shown.

If we were more interested in the number of clicks each specific person in the list received (regardless of which position they appeared in), then we can turn on "Match links by their target URL" in the clickmap menu. This matches clicks to elements based on their target URLs.

For example, if we enable this for our previous example, we see much fewer clicks. This is because we are now seeing clicks on each specific user:

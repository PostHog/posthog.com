The PostHog AI wizard helps you easily add PostHog to your application codebase using AI. It's an agentic CLI tool that handles the entire PostHog installation and integration process on your behalf.

```bash
npx @posthog/wizard
```

With a single command, the wizard automatically: 

1. Authenticates your PostHog account
2. Installs the relevant PostHog SDK(s)
3. Scans your codebase and app architecture
4. Creates directories and files
5. Configures `.env` file with your project credentials 
6. Writes code and initializes the PostHog SDKs client-side *and* server-side
7. Optionally installs the PostHog MCP server for your AI agent

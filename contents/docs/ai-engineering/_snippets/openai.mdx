Start by installing the OpenAI Python SDK:

```bash
pip install openai
```

In the spot where you initialize the OpenAI SDK, import PostHog and our OpenAI wrapper, initialize PostHog with your project API key and host (from [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project)), and pass it to our OpenAI wrapper.

```python
from posthog.ai.openai import OpenAI
import posthog

posthog.project_api_key = "<ph_project_api_key>"
posthog.host = "<ph_client_api_host>"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your_openai_api_key",
    posthog_client=posthog
)
```

> **Note:** This also works with the `AsyncOpenAI` client. 

Now, when you use the OpenAI SDK, it automatically captures many properties into PostHog including `$ai_input`, `$ai_input_tokens`, `$ai_latency`, `$ai_model`, `$ai_model_parameters`, `$ai_output`, and `$ai_output_tokens`.

You can also capture additional properties like `posthog_distinct_id`, `posthog_trace_id`, and `posthog_properties`.

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a fun fact about hedgehogs"}
    ],
    posthog_distinct_id="user_123",
    posthog_trace_id="trace_123",
    posthog_properties={"conversation_id": "abc123", "paid": True}
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

> **Note:** This also works with responses where `stream=True`.

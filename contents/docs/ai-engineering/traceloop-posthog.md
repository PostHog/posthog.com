> This integration is currently an [opt-in public beta](/docs/getting-started/enable-betas). This means it's not yet a perfect experience, but we'd love to know your thoughts. Please [share your feedback](http://us.posthog.com/home#supportModal) and [follow our roadmap](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/18547).

You can integrate with [Traceloop](https://www.traceloop.com/) and bring data into PostHog for analysis. Additionally, we offer a dashboard template to help you quickly get insights into your LLM product. 

## How to install the integration

1. Sign up for [Traceloop](https://www.traceloop.com/) and add it to your app.
2. Go to the [integrations page](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/integrations) in your Traceloop dashboard and click on the PostHog card.

3. Enter in your PostHog host and project API key (you can find these in your [PostHog project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project)).
4. Select the environment you want to connect to PostHog and click **Enable**.

Traceloop will now send events to PostHog under the name `traceloop span`.

## Using the Traceloop dashboard template

Once you've installed the integration, our Traceloop [dashboard template](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) helps you quickly set up relevant insights. You can see an [example dashboard here](https://us.posthog.com/shared/tpX9kUd5BbGkdjxQE8YhCskNuYA7Jw).

To create your own dashboard from a template:

1. Go the [dashboard tab](https://us.posthog.com/dashboard) in PostHog.
2. Click the **New dashboard** button in the top right.
3. Select **LLM metrics – Traceloop** from the list of templates.

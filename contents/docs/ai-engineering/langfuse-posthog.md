## How to install the integration

2. In your [Langfuse dashboard](https://cloud.langfuse.com/), click on **Settings** and scroll down to the **Integrations** section to find the PostHog integration.
3. Click **Configure** and paste in your PostHog host and project API key (you can find these in your [PostHog project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project)).
4. Click **Enabled** and then **Save**.

[Langfuse events](https://langfuse.com/docs/analytics/posthog#events) will now begin exporting into PostHog on an hourly schedule. 

## Using the Langfuse dashboard template

Once you've installed the integration, [dashboard templates](/docs/product-analytics/dashboards) help you quickly set up relevant insights. You can see an example [Langfuse dashboard here](https://eu.posthog.com/shared/HPOaK5zNVkP062nQJQJoooXe61l15w).

To create your own dashboard from a template:

1. Go the [dashboard tab](https://us.posthog.com/dashboard) in PostHog.
2. Click the **New dashboard** button in the top right.
3. Select **LLM metrics â€“ Langfuse** from the list of templates.

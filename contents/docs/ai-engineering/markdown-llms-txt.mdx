title: Markdown and llms.txt
---

LLMs and AI agents love Markdown. Us too. So we've made PostHog's documentation available in Markdown for developers to copy, crawl, and reuse as prompts or context.

## Markdown pages

Nearly every page in our developer docs has a raw Markdown version of itself â€“ including this one!

Markdown pages can be accessed by adding `.md` to the end of the URL, which serves the raw [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) we write our docs in.

| Page URL | Markdown URL |
|----------|--------------|
| [https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install](/docs/getting-started/install) | [https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install.md](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install.md) |
| [https://posthog.com/docs/error-tracking/capture](/docs/error-tracking/capture) | [https://posthog.com/docs/error-tracking/capture.md](https://posthog.com/docs/error-tracking/capture.md) |
| The page you're on right now ðŸ«µ | [https://posthog.com/docs/ai-engineering/markdown-llms-txt.md](https://posthog.com/docs/ai-engineering/markdown-llms-txt.md) |

There are some exceptions to this URL pattern, such as the API reference pages. Refer to [llms.txt](#llmstxt) to find the exact Markdown URLs for a specific page.

## llms.txt

You can find a directory of all our `.md` pages at [https://posthog.com/llms.txt](https://posthog.com/llms.txt), a new proposed standard that helps LLMs index content.

Docs pages have a **Copy page** dropdown with shortcuts to: 

- Copy the Markdown content to your clipboard
- View the raw Markdown version of the page
- Open a prompt in ChatGPT to read the page
- Open a prompt in Claude to read the page

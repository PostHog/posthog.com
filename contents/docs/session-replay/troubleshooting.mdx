Having trouble with recordings? Below are some tips for getting past some common issues

The most common solution is...

## Update posthog-js

We're always making improvements to the recordings feature, so you'll want to make sure that you're running the latest version of `posthog-js` on your website.

To check the version that you're using, you can run the following in your browser console:

```js
window.posthog.LIB_VERSION
```

## Recordings are not being captured

There are a few common reasons that you may not see recordings appear in your project.

### 1. Authorized domains for recordings

Authorized domains for recordings is deprecated, you should use URL triggers instead. [Read more in our replay controls doc](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#with-url-trigger-conditions).

In your [project replay settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/environment-replay#replay-authorized-domains), for older projects, there is a section for 'Authorized domains for replay'. This is the list of domains where posthog will capture recordings. You should make sure it's not too restrictive.

For example, you may have `https://www.example.com` in the list. This will stop PostHog from capturing recordings on `https://example.com`.

If no domains are set here, PostHog will capture recordings on all domains.

### 2. `posthog-js` configurations

If you had previously disabled session recordings, you may have set the `disable_session_recording` option to `true` in posthog-js.

To re-enable session recordings you want to either remove the `disable_session_recording` option or set it to `false`.

You can read more about [`posthog-js` configurations here](/docs/libraries/js/config).

### 3. Content security policy

When recordings are enabled, postHog-js will fetch a `recorder.js` script from the PostHog server. (This is not included in the default posthog-js to minimize the default bundle size)

Depending on your content security policy, this script may be blocked. If you have a `default-src`, `script-src`, `script-src-elem`, or `connect-src` directive in your CSP, you may need to ensure that PostHog domains are permitted (see [CSP documentation](/docs/advanced/content-security-policy)).

If PostHog is being blocked by your content security policy, you should see an error message in your developer console with more details.

### 4. Ad/tracking blockers

Some ad/tracking blockers will block PostHog from fetching `posthog-js`. If you're testing your app locally, you may need to disable any ad/tracking blockers that you're running in your browser.

[Deploying a reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy) is the best way to avoid tracking blockers intercepting calls to PostHog.

## Replay of recording looks incorrect or buggy

If you're having issues with recordings not looking correct, there are a few things you can:

### Ensure your website permits PostHog CORS

Most assets rendered on your website or app are captured **inline** – meaning we keep a copy of the icon, css etc. to use when replaying. For some assets however, this is either too difficult or too costly to do, so instead we load them directly from the original webserver (just like your website does). This can lead to CORS issues where the webserver does not permit **us.posthog.com** (or **eu.posthog.com**) to load the required asset. Unfortunately we cannot easily detect when this happens, but the browsers's developer tools `(Option + ⌘ + J, or Shift + CTRL + J)` will log when these errors occur saying something like:

```
Access to font at 'https://yourwebsite.com/fonts/MyriadPro-Bold.woff2' from origin 'https://us.posthog.com has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
@ GET https://yourwebsite.com/fonts/MyriadPro-Bold.woff2 net: :ERR_FAILED 200
```

If you see errors like this, please add `us.posthog.com` (or `eu.posthog.com`) to the list of permitted domains in your webservers CORS configuration.

### Adjust the crossorigin attribute on stylesheets
If the `crossorigin` attribute is not set on `link` elements a Chrome specific protection will prevent programmatic access to stylesheet rules (e.g. `stylesheet.cssRules` throws an exception). This means that styles on your site render as expected but they cannot be captured by PostHog in order to recreate the session during playback.

Setting `crossorigin="anonymous"` is the safest value you can set for the parameter as [no user credentials are added to the request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin#anonymous).

### Ensure assets are imported from the base URL in Svelte
By default, `base` and `assets` imported from `$app/paths` in Svelte use relative asset paths during server-side rendering.

For apps with SSR enabled you should set `relative` to `false` in the [`paths` object of your config](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#paths). This ensures all asset URLs will correctly be resolved against the base URL rather than the current page.

## Images and videos do not appear in the replay

PostHog captures session replays by capturing the DOM, not videos or screenshots. When you watch a replay, PostHog tries to reconstruct the DOM.

If the DOM contains images or other media assets referenced by a URL that is signed, expired, or otherwise not available, the replay will not be able to reconstruct the DOM correctly. A workaround to make replays more accurately represent the original session is to fallback to a placeholder if the asset is no longer available.

## Unable to filter by user or page properties

Some of the filtering options in session replays depend on [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics) events. 

To enable all filtering options, we recommend capturing at least one event per session. Most commonly identifying users via `identify()`. This makes sure you can use all of the power of filtering by person and event properties.

Since these events contribute to the product analytics usage and [billing limits](/docs/billing/limits-alerts), if you exceed your product analytics monthly limit, the recordings captured after that (until new billing period starts or limit is increased) won't be possible to filter by these properties.

## Internal users filtering or cohorts-based filters don't work

If you use cohorts to filter sessions, or add a cohort condition into the "Filter out internal and test users" setting - it can work incorrectly (or not work at all) while cohorts are calculating.

To check, you can go to "People > Cohorts" and see if any of them are in "calculating" status. 99% of the time they will be available in a couple of minutes, and if not (got stuck) - you can ask PostHog support to recalculate them for you manually.

## Filtering can't find my custom events

The most common reason for this is that you're trying to filter by events that weren't sent by the web SDK. For example, from another tool like Segment or one of our backend SDKs.

Session replay relies on the `$session_id` property added to events by the web SDK to link events to sessions.

To workaround this, you can use the `posthog.onSessionId` method in the web SDK to register a callback that will be called each time the session ID changes. You can send this to your backend and add the `$session_id` property to your backend events. 

## Recording not found

There are several valid reasons why recordings aren't captured. To keep the site fast we don't actively confirm a recording has been captured before showing the "view recording" button. 

For example:

 * If an event is captured before [your minimum recording duration setting](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay-triggers) there is no guarantee that the session lasted long enough to start recording.
 * If a user closes the browser tab or window there may not be enough time to send the data to the backend
 * If you have [conditional triggers set](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay-triggers) we don't send data to the backend until the trigger conditions are met

## Person not found

If you are able to capture a replay, but the entry says "person not found," this is replay has been captured from an anonymous user and a [person profile](/docs/data/persons) has **not** been created for them. 

To fix this, either call a method that creates a person profile (like `identify()`) or set the `person_profiles` value to `always`. See our doc on [anonymous vs identified events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) for more.

## Browser freezes or crashes when recordings are enabled

Some Cookie banners or "CMP"s modify the webpage in reaction to any changes to cookies, which can cause an infinite loop. If you are using a tool like this and experience the webpage becoming unresponsive or slow then try [configuring posthog](/docs/libraries/js/persistence) to use `persistence: "localStorage+cookie"`. This will use localStorage for the majority of storage needs, bypassing the infinite loop issue sometimes caused by cookie management tools.

## Enable recordings when URL matches not working as expected

The **Enable recordings when URL matches** setting is only supported in the web SDK version `1.171.0` and above. If your recordings aren’t being recorded as expected, even when the URL matches your regex, it’s likely due to an outdated SDK version.

Make sure you’re using version `1.171.0` or newer to ensure this feature works correctly.

## Network payload capture is not capturing headers

Browser do not automatically allow JS to read headers from cross-origin requests. So, when making a request from app.mywebsite.example to api.mywebsite.example headers are not available to be copied and reported.

You need to add `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *` as a header on responses from api.mywebsite.example to allow all headers to be read cross origin. You can specify which headers you want to be available `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Encoding, X-Correlation-Id` if you don't want all headers to be accessible.

## Recorder Limitations

Due to the complexity of browser rendering and replay, some web resources are unable to be recordered or playedback. These include:

- **Object elements** - Most object elements cannot be played back. Non-HTML native plugins such as Flash or Silverlight cannot be recorded
- **Heavy animations** - Some heavier animations such as SVG or Lottie animations may be _throttled_ or ignored entirely due to the performance overhead in recording and replaying
- **Iframes** - iframes from the origins under your control **can** be recorded and played back. See [iframe recording](/docs/session-replay/iframes) for more info.

## Angular performance

It is sometimes necessary to run session replay outside of the Angular zone. See the [PostHog Angular docs for more detail](/docs/libraries/angular#session-replay)

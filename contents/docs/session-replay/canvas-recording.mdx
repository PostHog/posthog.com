import ImgReplayCanvasLight from '../../images/docs/session-replay/enable-canvas-recording-in-replay-settings.png'

PostHog can capture canvas elements from your application. It works in both 2D and WebGL environments. 

As canvas elements can contain sensitive information, we do not capture these automatically. You can enable this feature globally from your [replay settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay).

Canvas elements are recorded at a rate of **4 frames per second** which may lead to some perceptual differences during playback.

> **Important:** There is no way to mask canvas elements right now so please ensure that they are are free of PII before enabling this feature.

> 🚧 **NOTE:** Mobile Recording is currently **only available on iOS** and is considered `alpha`. We are keen to gather as much feedback as possible so if you try this out please let us know and reach out in our [community](/questions) to share your experience with it.


# Overview

Mobile Session Recording allows you to record user sessions on mobile devices. This includes screen recordings, network requests, logs and touches. This data can then be used to understand how users are interacting with your app and to identify bugs and issues.

## How it works

We have taken our time to make sure that we can provide a useful and detailed recording experience whilst keeping the performance and security of your app as a top priority. By default the configuration is somewhat resritive with automatic masking and wifi-only uploads to ensure that we don't negatively impact the user experience. This can then be configured to be more or less restrictive depending on your needs.

#### Screen recording

Mobile Recording is primarily done using native APIs to grab an image copy of the primary View in the app. This is done carefully so as not to affect performance in any way a user may notice and at a rate of 1 frame per second, so as not to generate too much data. The image is compressed and uploaded to PostHog, by default only over wifi to ensure we aren't negatively impacting the users data plan. 

If a `redactionMode` is specified, the image is then processed to remove sensitive information. The different modes work as follows:
* `selective` (default) - Only redact views with an accessibilityId matching what is specified in `redactionTags`.
* `automatic` - Redact all views with the name matching `redactionViews` and all classes matching `redactionClasses`. Some sensible defaults are provided to capture anything Text like.
* `wireframe` - Renders a "wireframe" representation of the views instead of an captured image. This is great for highly sensitive environments where you still wan't to get a sense of user behaviour but don't want to capture any sensitive information.

#### Network recording

Network requests are recorded using the "swizzling" technique to intercept all `UrlSession` requests - the basis of all network requests in iOS. Only metric-like data is currently gathered to give a picture of speed, size and response code. No data is captured from the request or response body.

# Installation

### Via Swift Package Manager

Currently the only way to install the `beta` of the PostHog Recording iOS SDK is via Swift Package Manager. To do so, follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, select File > Add Packages.
2. Enter `https://github.com/posthog/posthog-ios` in the search bar.
3. Select the dependency rule `branch` and enter `feat/mobile-recordings` as the value.
4. Select the your project to add it to and click **Add Package**


### Setup with Objective C


In your AppDelegate file add the following:

```objc
#import "AppDelegate.h"
// ...

@import PostHog; // Add this import


- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    // ...other code

    PHGPostHogConfiguration *configuration = [PHGPostHogConfiguration configurationWithApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY" host:@"https://app.posthog.com"];

    // Any standard PostHog config options
    configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = YES; // Record certain application events automatically!
    configuration.captureScreenViews = YES; // Capture screen views automatically!
    
    // Any Recording specific config options
    configuration.recording.screenRecordingEnabled = YES; // Record the screen
    configuration.recording.networkRecordingEnabled = YES; // Record network requests
    configuration.recording.redactionMode = ScreenRecorderMaskingModeAutomatic; // Mask screen recordings automatically

    [PHGPostHog setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
}


```

### Setup with Swift


```swift
// AppDelegate.swift
import Foundation
import UIKit
import PostHog

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions _: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        let configuration = PHGPostHogConfiguration(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>", host: "<ph_instance_address>")

        configuration.captureApplicationLifecycleEvents = true; // Record certain application events automatically!
        configuration.captureScreenViews = true; // Capture screen views automatically!
        
        configuration.recording.screenRecordingEnabled = true
        configuration.recording.logRecordingEnabled = true
        configuration.recording.networkRecordingEnabled = true
        configuration.recording.redactionMode = .automatic

        return true
    }
}
```


#### SwiftUI
If you haven't already, crate the `AppDelegate.swift` file mentioned above and then in your `App` file add the following:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct AboutMeApp: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate // Add this if not already there
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```


# Recording specific configuration

```swift
// The values shown are the defaults
let config = PostHogRecorderConfig(
    // Whether to enable recording. If false, all other options are ignored
    screenRecordingEnabled: true,
    // Whether to enable log recording. Logs with OSLog will be automatically recorded or you can log directly with PostHog.shared.recorder.log()
    logRecordingEnabled: true,
    // Records network requests via swizzling of NsUrlSession.
    networkRecordingEnabled: true,
    // What level of redcaction to perform
    // -> .selective = only redact manually specified views with an accessibilityId matching what is specified in `redactionTags`.
    // -> .automatic = redact all views with the name matching `redactionViews` and all classes matching `redactionClasses`
    // -> .wireframe = renders a "wireframe" of the view, without any text or images
    redactionMode: .selective,
    redactionTags: ["ph-no-capture"],
    redactionViews: PostHogRecorderConfig.DefaultRedactionViews,
    redactionClasses: PostHogRecorderConfig.DefaultRedactionClasses,
    // Hosts to ignore when recording network requests. By default the PostHog API host is ignored
    ignoreNetworkHosts: []
)
```

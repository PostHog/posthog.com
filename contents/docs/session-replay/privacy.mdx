PostHog offers a range of controls to limit what data is captured by session recordings. Our privacy controls run in the browser or mobile app. So, masked data is never sent over the network to PostHog.

### Network capture

Session replay also allows you to capture network requests and responses. Headers and bodies can include sensitive information. We scrub some headers automatically, but if your network requests and responses include sensitive information you can provide a function to scrub them. [Read more in our network capture docs](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/network-recording#sensitive-information)

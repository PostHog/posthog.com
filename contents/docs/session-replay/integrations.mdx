Session replay integrates with issue tracking tools like **Linear**, **GitHub**, and **GitLab**. This enables you to create and link issues directly from a replay, making it easy to track bugs and share context with your team.

## Setting up integrations

To enable integrations, go to your project settings and connect your Linear, GitHub, or GitLab account. Once connected, you can select which projects or repositories you want to link issues to.

## Creating issues from a replay

When viewing a session replay, click the **Create issue** button to open the issue creation modal. From here you can:

1. Select which integration to use (Linear, GitHub, or GitLab)
2. Choose the project or repository
3. Add a title and description
4. Create the issue

The issue will automatically include a link back to the session replay, giving your team full context on what happened.

## Viewing linked issues

Once an issue is linked to a replay, it will appear in the replay sidebar. You can click on the issue to open it directly in Linear, GitHub, or GitLab.

title: Replay data retention
---

Depending on how your app or website is built, recordings can take a lot of disk space. To manage this, we have the following retention policy options in place.

## PostHog Cloud

Recordings are automatically deleted after **1 month** (**3 months** for paid customers). 
The deletion is not immediate meaning that recordings may still appear for a short time in the UI after the retention period expires. 
Or when manually deleted via the UI. 


### Preserving recordings

Pinned or Shared recordings are kept for as long as they are actively in use. Alternatively, any individual recording that you would like to preserve for longer can be done by downloading them locally. Downloaded recordings can then be imported back into PostHog for future playback, even if the original recording has expired.


## Clickhouse Self-hosted 

Self-hosted installations are able to control the TTL by updating the `RECORDINGS_TTL_WEEKS` configuration on your instance settings page. 

Please note, for versions of PostHog that rely on Clickhouse storage. You need to manage the available capacity. Ensure you increase volume capacity before changing the `RECORDINGS_TTL_WEEKS` value (even if you're decreasing the value). ClickHouse requires abundant free disk space to manage the `session_recording_events` table.

In later versions (which do not use Clickhouse for recording storage), the installation will be relying on its configured blob storage. And the much smaller `session_replay_events` table which does not need management differently to other tables.

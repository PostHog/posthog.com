title: Replay data retention
---

Depending on how your app or website is built, recordings can take a lot of disk space. To manage this, we have the following retention policy options in place.

## PostHog Cloud

Recordings are automatically deleted after **3 weeks**. The deletion is not immediate meaning that they may still appear for a short time in the UI after the 3 week period or if manually deleted via the UI. 


### Preserving recordings

Pinned or Shared recordings are kept for as long as they are actively in use. Alternatively, any individual recording that you would like to preserve for longer can be done by downloading them locally. Downloaded recordings can then be imported back into PostHog for future playback, even if the original recording has expired.


## Clickhouse Self-hosted 

Self-hosted is the same as Cloud, except you are able to control the TTL by updating the `RECORDINGS_TTL_WEEKS` configuration on your instance settings page. Please note, if your Clickhouse storage is nearing capacity, you'll want to temporarily increase your volume size before running the command above (even if you're decreasing the value). Otherwise, the command can hang.

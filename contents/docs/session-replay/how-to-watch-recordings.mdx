To watch recordings, you can visit the [Replay](https://app.posthog.com/replay) page. When watching replays, you can change the playback speed, as well as select the option 'skip inactivity' - this skips parts of the recording where the user was inactive on the page.

You can also watch recordings by clicking on any data point in an insight. This opens a list of persons and displays a "watch recording" button if available. This is especially useful in [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels), where you can drill down and watch recordings of users who converted or dropped off. 

You can also click into the "Recordings" tab for a person to view all their recordings.

## How to create a playlist

It's possible to create dynamic playlists of replays that you're interested in. To do so, go to the [Playlists tab](https://app.posthog.com/replay/playlists) and click "New playlist". You'll then have the option to apply filters to specify the criteria videos in the playlist should meet, for example:

- Recording time and duration.
- Event and [action](/docs/data/actions) filters.
- Person and [cohort](/docs/data/cohorts) filters. These require capturing identified events.
- Console log level filters: Log, warn, and error.

To watch recordings, you can visit the [Replay](https://app.posthog.com/replay) page. When watching replays, you can change the playback speed, as well as select the option 'skip inactivity' - this skips parts of the recording where the user was inactive on the page.

You can also watch recordings by clicking on any data point in an insight. This will open the list of persons and display a "watch recording" button if it is available. This is especially useful in [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels), where you can drill down and watch recordings of users who converted or dropped off. 

You can also click into the "Recordings" tab for a person to view all their recordings.

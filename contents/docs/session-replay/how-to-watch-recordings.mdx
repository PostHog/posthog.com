To watch recordings, you can visit the [Replay](https://us.posthog.com/replay) page or click on any data point in an insight. This opens a list of persons and displays a **Watch recording** button or **Recordings** tab if available. This is especially useful in [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels), where you can drill down and [watch recordings of users who converted or dropped off](/tutorials/explore-insights-session-recordings).

When watching replays, you can:

1. Change the playback speed, as well as select the option **Skip inactivity** which skips parts of the recording where the user was inactive on the page.

2. Open the activity panel to see a list of all the events that happened during the recording. This also lets you see the network waterfall, page performance score, asset breakdown, and more.

3. Click **Inspect DOM** to interact with the DOM of the page. It may not be 100% accurate, but should be close enough to help you debug. You can interact with the content below but most things won't work as it is only a snapshot of your app. Use your browser's developer tools (`CMD`+`Opt`+`I` on Mac and `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` on PC for Chrome) to inspect the content.

4. Add comments by pressing **C** or clicking the **Comment** button to share your thoughts with your team. You can also add emojis to the timeline to highlight specific parts.

5. Enter cinema and fullscreen mode to remove the UI elements and focus on the recording.

## How to create saved filters

It's possible to create a dynamic list of replays that you're interested in.

To do so:

1. Click **Show filters**.
2. Create your filter with options for date, active duration, events, properties, console logs, and more.
3. Once done, click **Add to "Saved filters"**.

This will then be accessible to anyone in your project via the **Shared filters** tab and new replays will automatically be added to it.

## How to create a collection

If instead, you want to create a more permanent list of replays to watch later, analyze specific behavior, or share with your team, you can create a collection.

To do so, click **+ Add to collection** next to the **Share** button on a replay, search or create a new collection, and then select it. You can share the collection by going to the [collection page](https://us.posthog.com/replay/playlists), finding that collection, and sharing the link to anyone with access to your PostHog project.

## Capturing and sharing moments

PostHog makes it easy to capture and share specific moments from your recordings:

- **Screenshots**: Press **S** or click the camera icon to take a screenshot of the current moment. Perfect for capturing specific UI states or issues to share with your team.
- **Short clips**: Press **X** or click the clip icon to create 5, 10, or 15-second clips in GIF or MP4 format. These are ideal for sharing quick demonstrations of user behavior or bugs.

Both features are available in the bottom right corner of the recording player and provide an easy way to extract and share key insights from your session recordings. You can use these captures to share findings with colleagues, attach visual evidence to bug reports in task managers like Jira or Linear, or include them in team discussions and documentation.

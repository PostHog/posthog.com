We aim to be significantly cheaper than our competitors. In addition to our [ridiculously cheap pricing](/pricing), below are few ways to reduce costs by recording fewer sessions:

1. [Disable automatic recording and programmatically start and stop recordings](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#programmatically-start-and-stop-recordings)
2. [Set a feature flag](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#with-feature-flags) with the conditions that define which users or sessions you want to record.
3. Set a [minimum recording duration](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#minimum-duration).
4. Set a [sampling rate](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#sampling) for recordings.

We aim to be significantly cheaper than our competitors. Session replay is [pay-as-you-go](/pricing) and you are billed for the number of session recordings **at ingestion** time. This means the total number of sessions retained in PostHog doesn't affect your bill, you don't have to worry about deleting old sessions, and you don't have to worry about the cost of storing old sessions.

Below are few ways to reduce costs by recording fewer sessions:

1. [Disable automatic recording and programmatically start and stop recordings](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#programmatically-start-and-stop-recordings)
2. [Set a feature flag](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#with-feature-flags) with the conditions that define which users or sessions you want to record.
3. Set a [minimum recording duration](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#minimum-duration).
4. Set a [sampling rate](/docs/session-replay/how-to-control-which-sessions-you-record#sampling) for recordings.
5. [Make sure you capture at least one event per session](/docs/session-replay/troubleshooting#unable-to-filter-by-user-or-page-properties) to reduce the costs while maintaining all filtering options.

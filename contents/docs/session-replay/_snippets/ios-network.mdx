In iOS, PostHog uses method swizzling on [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) methods, which allows for the out-of-the-box collection of network data.

However, URLSessionâ€™s async/await-powered APIs which are not exposed to the `objc` runtime and cannot be swizzled. As a result, network telemetry cannot be automatically captured. 

For apps using async `URLSession` methods, PostHog provides wrapper functions that you can use to manually capture network logs. 

```swift
import PostHog

func fetchData(from url: URL) async throws -> Data {
   // let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)      // â¬… replace this
   let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.postHogData(from: url)  // ðŸ¦” with this

  // your logic here...
  return data
    
}
```

You can find a list of available methods to use manually [here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/blob/main/PostHog/Replay/URLSessionExtension.swift).

> **Note:** Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured. No data is captured from the request or response body.

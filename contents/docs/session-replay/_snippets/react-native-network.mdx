To capture network requests in your recordings, add `captureNetworkTelemetry: true` to your PostHog Session replay configuration alongside any of your other configuration options:

> **Note:** Capture network requests is only available for iOS.

```js
export const posthog = new PostHog(
  '<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    // Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
    // Default is false.
    enableSessionReplay: true,
    sessionReplayConfig: {
      // Whether network requests are captured in recordings. Default is true
      // Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured.
      // No data is captured from the request or response body.
      // iOS only
      captureNetworkTelemetry: true,
      ...
    },
  },
);
```

> **Note:** Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured. No data is captured from the request or response body.

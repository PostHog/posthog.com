Your replays may contain sensitive information. For example, if you're building a banking app you may not want to capture how much money a user has in their account. 

To replace any type of `React.Component` with a redacted version in the replay, set the [accessibilityLabel](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel) to `ph-no-capture`:

```js
<Text accessibilityLabel="ph-no-capture">Hello PostHog 👋</Text>
```

## Expo

Mobile Session Replay for Expo works normally, but prefer the `expo` tools for installing and running your project.

Install the session replay plugin.

```bash
npx expo install posthog-react-native-session-replay
```

Expo Go isn't supported since it uses Native plugins, please use development build.

```bash
# Run Android development build 
npx expo run:android --no-build-cache --device

# Run iOS development build 
npx expo run:ios --no-build-cache --device
```

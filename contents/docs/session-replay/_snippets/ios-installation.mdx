## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

import IOSInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-ios.mdx"

export const EnableSessionReplayDark = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings-dark-mode.png"
export const EnableSessionReplayLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings-light-mode.png"

<IOSInstall />

> Requires PostHog iOS SDK version >= [3.6.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.

## Step two: Enable session recordings in your project settings

Enable session recordings in your PostHog [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={EnableSessionReplayLight} 
  imageDark={EnableSessionReplayDark} 
  alt="Enable session recordings in your PostHog'"
  classes="rounded"
/>

## Step three: Configure replay settings

### Automatically start session recordings

Setting `config.sessionReplay = true` to your PostHog configuration will start session recordings on SDK setup.

### Manually control session recordings

Setting `config.sessionReplay = false` to your PostHog configuration will prevent PostHog from automatically starting session recordings on SDK setup. 

You can manually control when to start and stop session recordings using the following two methods:

- `startSessionRecording(resumeCurrent: Bool)`
  - Set **resumeCurrent** to `true` to resume a previous session recording (Default). 
  - Set **resumeCurrent** to `false` to start a new session recording. 
- `stopSessionRecording()` 
  - Stops/pauses the current session recording.

> **Note:** Calling these methods will have no effect if session recordings are disabled in your PostHog [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

## Configuration options

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: "<ph_project_api_key>")
// Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
// Default is false.
config.sessionReplay = true

// Whether text and text input fields are masked. Default is true.
// Password inputs are always masked regardless
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllTextInputs = true

// Whether images are masked. Default is true.
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllImages = true

// Enable masking of all sandboxed system views
// These may include UIImagePickerController, PHPickerViewController and CNContactPickerViewController
// Default is true.
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllSandboxedViews = true

// Whether network requests are captured in recordings. Default is true
// Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured. 
// No data is captured from the request or response body.
config.sessionReplayConfig.captureNetworkTelemetry = true

// Whether replays are created using high quality screenshots. Default is false.
// Required for SwiftUI.
// If disabled, replays are created using wireframes instead.
// The screenshot may contain sensitive information, so use with caution
config.sessionReplayConfig.screenshotMode = true

// Deboucer delay used to reduce the number of snapshots captured and reduce performance impact. Default is 1s
config.sessionReplayConfig.debouncerDelay = 1.0
```

## Limitations

- On iOS, minimum deployment target is [iOS13](/docs/libraries/ios)
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is only supported if the `screenshotMode` option is enabled.
- Custom views are not fully supported if `screenshotMode` is disabled.
- WebView is not supported. A placeholder will be shown.

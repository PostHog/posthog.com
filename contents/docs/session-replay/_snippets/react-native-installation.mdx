title: React Native session replay
---

## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

import ReactNativeInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-react-native.mdx"

export const EnableSessionReplayDark = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings-dark-mode.png"
export const EnableSessionReplayLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings-light-mode.png"


<ReactNativeInstall />

> Requires PostHog React Native SDK version >= [3.2.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.

Install the session replay plugin.

```bash
yarn add posthog-react-native-session-replay
# or npm
npm i -s posthog-react-native-session-replay
```

## Step two: Enable session recordings in your project settings

Enable session recordings in your PostHog [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={EnableSessionReplayLight} 
  imageDark={EnableSessionReplayDark} 
  alt="Enable session recordings in your PostHog'"
  classes="rounded"
/>

## Step three: Configure replay settings

Add `enableSessionReplay: true` to your PostHog configuration alongside any of your other configuration options:

```ts
export const posthog = new PostHog(
  '<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    // Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
    // Default is false.
    enableSessionReplay: true,
    sessionReplayConfig: {
      // Whether text and text input fields are masked. Default is true.
      // Password inputs are always masked regardless
      maskAllTextInputs: true,
      // Whether images are masked. Default is true.
      maskAllImages: true,
      // Enable masking of all sandboxed system views like UIImagePickerController, PHPickerViewController and CNContactPickerViewController. Default is true.
      // iOS only
      maskAllSandboxedViews: true,
      // Capture logs automatically. Default is true.
      // Android only (Native Logcat only)
      captureLog: true,
      // Whether network requests are captured in recordings. Default is true
      // Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured.
      // No data is captured from the request or response body.
      // iOS only
      captureNetworkTelemetry: true,
      // Deboucer delay used to reduce the number of snapshots captured and reduce performance impact. Default is 1000ms
      // Ps: it was 500ms (0.5s) by default until version 3.3.7
      androidDebouncerDelayMs: 1000,
      // Deboucer delay used to reduce the number of snapshots captured and reduce performance impact. Default is 1000ms
      iOSdebouncerDelayMs: 1000,
    },
  },
);
```

Or using the `PostHogProvider`:

```ts
<PostHogProvider
        apiKey="<ph_project_api_key>"
        options={{
          enableSessionReplay: true,
          ...
        }}
      >
```

## Expo

Mobile Session Replay for Expo works normally, but prefer the `expo` tools for installing and running your project.

Install the session replay plugin.

```bash
npx expo install posthog-react-native-session-replay
```

Expo Go isn't supported since it uses Native plugins, please use development build.

```bash
# Run Android development build 
npx expo run:android --no-build-cache --device

# Run iOS development build 
npx expo run:ios --no-build-cache --device
```

## Limitations

- On Android, requires API >= 26.
- On iOS, minimum deployment target is [iOS13](/docs/libraries/ios)
- Keyboard is not supported. A placeholder will be shown.
- Wireframe mode isn't supported, only screenshot mode.
- Expo Go isn't supported since it uses Native plugins, please use development build.
- Masking individual view components within a WebView isn't supported, if your WebView displays sensitive view components, you've to [mask](/docs/session-replay/privacy?tab=React+Native) the whole WebView.

## Troubleshooting

- Run a clean build if you experience issues such as `The package 'posthog-react-native-session-replay' doesn't seem to be linked`.
- Update your iOS Pods.

To capture network requests in your recordings, add `PostHogOkHttpInterceptor` to your `OkHttp Interceptor`. 

```android_kotlin
import com.posthog.PostHogOkHttpInterceptor
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient

private val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(PostHogOkHttpInterceptor(captureNetworkTelemetry = true))
    .build()
```

> **Note:** Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured. No data is captured from the request or response body.

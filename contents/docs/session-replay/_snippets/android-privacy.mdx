To replace any type of `View` with a redacted version in the recording, set the [tag](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#tags) to `ph-no-capture`.

```xml
<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/imvProfilePhoto"
    android:layout_width="200dp"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    android:tag="ph-no-capture"
/>
```

### Masking in Jetpack Compose

- You can manually mark a Compose View for masking using the `postHogMask()` view modifier:

```android_kotlin
...
    Text(
        text = AnnotatedString(text),
        modifier =
            modifier
                .wrapContentSize()
                .postHogMask()
                .clickable {
                    text = "Sensitive!"
                },
    )
...
```

### Handling sensitive third-party screens

Third-party components (like payment forms or authentication screens) are often rendered in separate view hierarchies that can't be accessed or modified for masking.

For these cases, manually controlling the recording state is the only reliable solution. For example:

```android_kotlin
// Stop session recording before showing a third-party payment sheet
PostHog.stopSessionReplay()

// Present third-party payment sheet
presentPaymentSheet()

// ... 
// Some time later when the sheet is dismissed, resume recording
PostHog.startSessionReplay()
```

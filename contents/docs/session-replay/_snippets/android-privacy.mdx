> ðŸš§ **NOTE:** Currently, this isn't supported if using Jetpack Compose views. We're investigating this [issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/issues/158).

To replace any type of `View` with a redacted version in the recording, set the [tag](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#tags) to `ph-no-capture`.

```xml
<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/imvProfilePhoto"
    android:layout_width="200dp"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    android:tag="ph-no-capture"
/>
```

### Limitations

- Requires Android API >= 26.
- Jetpack Compose is only supported if `screenshotMode` is enabled.
  - Masking and redacting in Jetpack Compose isn't supported yet. We're investigating this [issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/issues/158).
- Custom views are partly supported, and only fully supported if `screenshotMode`  is enabled.
- WebView is not supported. A placeholder will be shown.
- Keyboard is not supported. A placeholder will be shown.
- Flutter for Android isn't supported.

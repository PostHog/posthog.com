## Step one: Install our JavaScript web library

If you already have our JavaScript library or snippet installed, you can skip this step.

import JSInstallWeb from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-web.mdx"

<JSInstallWeb />

## Step two: Enable session recordings in your project settings

Enable session recordings in your PostHog [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight={EnableSessionReplayLight} 
  imageDark={EnableSessionReplayDark} 
  alt="Enable session recordings in your PostHog'"
  classes="rounded"
/>

Once enabled, the library will start recording sessions by default.

They can be toggled off in the by setting the `disable_session_recording: true` flag in the [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config). 

Users who [opt out](/docs/libraries/js#opt-users-out) of event capturing will not have their sessions recorded.

> **Note on using Segment's SDK**: Session Replay does not work if you send data using [Segment's SDK](/docs/libraries/segment) as this data is not collected. If you use Segment, you may want to add the PostHog library as well â€“ (make sure to only send regular event data from one source).

## How to ignore sensitive elements

You may want to hide sensitive text or elements in your replays. See our [privacy controls](/docs/session-replay/privacy) docs for how to do this.

## How to record sessions across different domains

PostHog automatically captures sessions across subdomains (e.g. `posthog.com` and `us.posthog.com`), but recording sessions across different domains (e.g. `posthog.com` and `hogflix.com`) requires a bit more setup.

To do this, you need to pass the `session_id` from the first domain to the second domain (for example, as a URL parameter). You can get this value by calling `posthog.get_session_id()`.

Below is an example of how this looks like in Next.js:

```js
// first domain
'use client'
import { usePostHog } from 'posthog-js/react'

export default function FirstDomain() {
  const posthog = usePostHog()
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the first domain</h1>
      <button onClick={
        () => window.location.href = `https://seconddomain.com/?session_id=${posthog.get_session_id()}`
      }>
        Go to the second domain
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

On the second domain, bootstrap the PostHog initialization using the session ID. 

```js
// second domain
'use client'
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { PostHogProvider } from 'posthog-js/react'
import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export function PHProvider({ children }) {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()
  const sessionId = searchParams.get('session_id')

  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
      api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
      bootstrap: {
        sessionID: sessionId
      }
    })
  }

  return <PostHogProvider client={posthog}>{children}</PostHogProvider>
}
```

With this setup, PostHog tracks the user's session across domains and captures a single, combined replay.

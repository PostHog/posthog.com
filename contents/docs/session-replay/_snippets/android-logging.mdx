You can enable this feature from your client-side by setting `captureLogcat = true` in our [Android SDK config](/docs/session-replay/installation?tab=Android#step-two-configure-replay-settings).

```android_kotlin
val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(apiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>").apply {
    // Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
    // Default is false.
    sessionReplay = true
    // Capture logs automatically. Default is true.
    sessionReplayConfig.captureLogcat = true
    ...
}
```

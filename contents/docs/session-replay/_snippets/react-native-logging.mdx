You can enable this feature from your client-side by setting `captureLog: true` in our [React Native SDK config](/docs/session-replay/installation?tab=React%20Native#step-two-configure-replay-settings).

> **Note:** Console log recording is only available for Android.

```js
export const posthog = new PostHog(
  '<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    // Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
    // Default is false.
    enableSessionReplay: true,
    sessionReplayConfig: {
      // Capture logs automatically. Default is true.
      // Android only (Native Logcat only)
      captureLog: true,
      ...
    },
  },
);
```

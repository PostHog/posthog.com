> 🚧 **NOTE:** Android is considered `beta` and is free while in beta. We are keen to gather as much feedback as possible so if you try this out please let us know. You can send feedback via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Asession_replay%3Alow) or one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

import AndroidInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-android.mdx"

<AndroidInstall />

> Session replay requires PostHog Android SDK version >= [3.4.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.

## Step two: Configure replay settings

Add `sessionReplay = true` to your PostHog configuration alongside any of your other configuration options:

```android_kotlin
val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(apiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>").apply {
    // Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
    // Default is false.
    sessionReplay = true

    // Whether text and text input fields are masked. Default is true.
    // Password inputs are always masked regardless
    sessionReplayConfig.maskAllTextInputs = true

    // Whether images are masked. Default is true.
    sessionReplayConfig.maskAllImages = true

    // Capture logs automatically. Default is true.
    sessionReplayConfig.captureLogcat = true

    // Whether replays are created using high quality screenshots. Default is false.
    // If disabled, replays are created using wireframes instead.
    // The screenshot may contain sensitive information, so use with caution
    sessionReplayConfig.screenshot = false

    // Deboucer delay used to reduce the number of snapshots captured and reduce performance impact. Default is 1000ms
    // Ps: it was 500ms (0.5s) by default until version 3.8.2
    sessionReplayConfig.debouncerDelayMs = 1000
}
```

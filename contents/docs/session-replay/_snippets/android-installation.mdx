> 🚧 **NOTE:** Android is considered `beta` and is free while in beta. We are keen to gather as much feedback as possible so if you try this out please let us know. You can send feedback via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Asession_replay%3Alow) or one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

## Installation 

[Install and configure PostHog]((/docs/libraries/android#installation)) as you normally would. Ensure you've enabled session recordings in your [project settings](/docs/session-replay/installation#step-two-enable-session-recordings-in-your-project-settings) and then add `sessionReplay = true` to your PostHog configuration alongside any of your other configuration options.  

> Session replay requires PostHog Android SDK version >= [3.4.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-android/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.

```android_kotlin
val config = PostHogAndroidConfig(apiKey = "<ph_project_api_key>").apply {
    // Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
    // Default is false.
    sessionReplay = true

    // Whether text inputs are masked. Default is true.
    // This isn't supported for Jetpack Compose views.
    // Password inputs are always masked regardless
    sessionReplayConfig.maskAllTextInputs = true

    // Whether images are masked. Default is true.
    // This isn't supported for Jetpack Compose views.
    sessionReplayConfig.maskAllImages = true

    // Capture logs automatically. Default is true.
    sessionReplayConfig.captureLogcat = true

    // Whether replays are created using high quality screenshots. Default is false.
    // If disabled, replays are created using wireframes instead.
    // The screenshot may contain sensitive information, so use with caution
    sessionReplayConfig.screenshot = false

    // Deboucer delay used to reduce the number of snapshots captured and reduce performance impact. Default is 500ms
    sessionReplayConfig.debouncerDelayMs = 500
}
```

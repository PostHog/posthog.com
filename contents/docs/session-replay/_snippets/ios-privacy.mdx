To replace any type of `UIView` with a redacted version in the replay, set the [accessibilityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityidentification/1623132-accessibilityidentifier) to `ph-no-capture`:

```swift
let imvProfilePhoto = UIImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
imvProfilePhoto.accessibilityIdentifier = "ph-no-capture"
```

> **Note:** For SwiftUI please refer to the [Masking in SwiftUI](#masking-in-swiftui) section below

### Masking in SwiftUI

- When using the [SwiftUI TextField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield) with [UITextInputTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextinputtraits), setting traits such as `TextField("Email", text: ...).keyboardType(.emailAddress)` will always be automatically masked since it's for private text.
- The [SwiftUI SecureField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/securefield) view is always automatically masked.
- You can manually mark a SwiftUI View for masking using the `postHogMask()` view modifier:

  ```swift
  // This view (and children) will *always* be masked in session replay recordings
  MyCoolView()
    .postHogMask()
  ```
- The `postHogNoMask()` view modifier can be used to prevent a view from being masked in session recordings, regardless of any default masking behavior:

  ```swift
  // This view (and children) will *never* be masked in session replay recordings
  MyCoolView()
    .postHogNoMask()
  ```

To replace any type of `UIView` with a redacted version in the replay, set the [accessibilityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityidentification/1623132-accessibilityidentifier) to `ph-no-capture`:

```swift
let imvProfilePhoto = UIImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
imvProfilePhoto.accessibilityIdentifier = "ph-no-capture"
```

> **Note:** For SwiftUI please refer to the [Masking in SwiftUI](#masking-in-swiftui) section below

### Masking in SwiftUI

- When using the [SwiftUI TextField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield) with [UITextInputTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextinputtraits), setting traits such as `TextField("Email", text: ...).keyboardType(.emailAddress)` will always be automatically masked since it's for private text.
- The [SwiftUI SecureField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/securefield) view is always automatically masked.
- You can manually mark a SwiftUI View for masking using the `postHogMask()` view modifier:

  ```swift
  // This view (and children) will *always* be masked in session replay recordings
  MyCoolView()
    .postHogMask()
  ```
- The `postHogNoMask()` view modifier can be used to prevent a view from being masked in session recordings, regardless of any default masking behavior:

  ```swift
  // This view (and children) will *never* be masked in session replay recordings
  MyCoolView()
    .postHogNoMask()
  ```


<CalloutBox title="SwiftUI and Xcode 26" type="caution" icon="IconInfo">

Apps built with Xcode 26 use a new SwiftUI rendering model that changes how SwiftUI views map to UIKit. This can cause `postHogMask()` and `postHogNoMask()` to behave inconsistently on primitive views like `Text`, `Image`, and `Button`.

**If you're building with Xcode 26**, update to [version 3.36.2](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/releases/tag/3.36.2) or later to ensure these modifiers work correctly.

### Handling sensitive third-party screens

Third-party components (like payment forms or authentication screens) are often rendered in separate view hierarchies that can't be accessed or modified for masking.

For these cases, manually controlling the recording state is the only reliable solution. For example:

```ios_swift
// Stop session recording before showing a third-party payment sheet
PostHogSDK.shared.stopSessionRecording()

// Present third-party payment sheet
presentPaymentSheet()

// ... 
// Some time later when the sheet is dismissed, resume recording
PostHogSDK.shared.startSessionRecording()
```

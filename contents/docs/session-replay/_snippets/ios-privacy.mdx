To replace any type of `UIView` with a redacted version in the replay, set the [accessibilityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityidentification/1623132-accessibilityidentifier) to `ph-no-capture`:

```swift
let imvProfilePhoto = UIImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
imvProfilePhoto.accessibilityIdentifier = "ph-no-capture"
```

> **Note:** For SwiftUI please refer to the [Masking in SwiftUI](#masking-in-swiftui) section below

### Masking in SwiftUI

- When using the [SwiftUI TextField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield) with [UITextInputTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextinputtraits), setting traits such as `TextField("Email", text: ...).keyboardType(.emailAddress)` will always be automatically masked since it's for private text.
- The [SwiftUI SecureField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/securefield) view is always automatically masked.
- You can manually mark a SwiftUI View for masking using the `postHogMask()` view modifier:

  ```swift
  // This view (and children) will *always* be masked in session replay recordings
  MyCoolView()
    .postHogMask()
  ```
- The `postHogNoMask()` view modifier can be used to prevent a view from being masked in session recordings, regardless of any default masking behavior:

  ```swift
  // This view (and children) will *never* be masked in session replay recordings
  MyCoolView()
    .postHogNoMask()
  ```


<CalloutBox title="SwiftUI and Xcode 26" type="caution" icon="IconInfo">

SwiftUI rendering behavior changed for apps built with Xcode 26 (including when running on iOS 26).
This affects how SwiftUI maps to UIKit. As a result, the view modifiers `postHogMask()` and `postHogNoMask()` may behave inconsistently for primitive SwiftUI views like `Text`, `Image`, and `Button`.

If you rely on these modifiers for privacy, we recommend validating masking after upgrading Xcode:

- Text inputs like `TextField`, `TextEditor`, `SecureField` and custom views are not affected by this change.
- For primitive views, try masking a parent view instead.
- Use `ph-no-capture` tagging for UIKit-backed views.
- Stop and restart session recording around sensitive screens.

### Handling sensitive third-party screens

Third-party components (like payment forms or authentication screens) are often rendered in separate view hierarchies that can't be accessed or modified for masking.

For these cases, manually controlling the recording state is the only reliable solution. For example:

```ios_swift
// Stop session recording before showing a third-party payment sheet
PostHogSDK.shared.stopSessionRecording()

// Present third-party payment sheet
presentPaymentSheet()

// ... 
// Some time later when the sheet is dismissed, resume recording
PostHogSDK.shared.startSessionRecording()
```

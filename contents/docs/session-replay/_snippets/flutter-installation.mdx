## Step one: Add PostHog to your app

> Session replay requires PostHog Flutter SDK version >= [4.7.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-flutter/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.

import FlutterInstall from "../../integrate/_snippets/install-flutter.mdx"

export const EnableSessionReplayDark = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings-dark-mode.png"
export const EnableSessionReplayLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings-light-mode.png"


<FlutterInstall />

#### Widget and Observer setup

> This configuration is only needed for mobile session replay.

Wrap your app with the `PostHogWidget` Widget and Install the `PosthogObserver` Observer.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:posthog_flutter/posthog_flutter.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return PostHogWidget(
      child: MaterialApp(
        navigatorObservers: [PosthogObserver()],
        title: 'My App',
        home: const HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

If you're using `go_router`, check [this page](/docs/libraries/flutter#capturing-screen-views) to learn how to set up the `PosthogObserver`.

## Step two: Enable session recordings in your project settings

Enable session recordings in your PostHog [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

If you're using Flutter Web, also enable the [Canvas capture](/docs/session-replay/canvas-recording) in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay).  
This is needed as Flutter renders your app using a browser canvas element.

## Step three: Configure replay settings  

Add `sessionReplay = true` to your PostHog configuration alongside any of your other configuration options:

```dart
final config = PostHogConfig('<ph_project_api_key>');
/// Enable Recording of Session replay for Android and iOS.
/// Requires Record user sessions to be enabled in the PostHog Project Settings.
/// Defaults to false.
config.sessionReplay = true;
/// Enable masking of all text and text input fields.
/// Default: true.
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllTexts = false;
/// Enable masking of all images.
/// Default: true.
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllImages = false;
/// Throttling delay used to reduce the number of snapshots captured and reduce performance impact.
/// This is used for capturing the view as a screenshot.
/// The lower the number, the more snapshots will be captured but higher the performance impact.
/// Defaults to 1s.
/// Ps: it was called [debouncerDelay] until version 4.7.1
config.sessionReplayConfig.throttleDelay = const Duration(milliseconds: 1000);
```

## Limitations for mobile session replay

- On Android, requires API >= 26.
- On iOS, minimum deployment target is [iOS13](/docs/libraries/ios).
- Wireframe mode isn't supported, only screenshot mode.
- [Network performance recording](docs/session-replay/network-recording) isn't supported yet.

## Limitations for flutter web session replay

- The [Canvas capture](/docs/session-replay/canvas-recording) enabled is required.

## Troubleshooting

- Run a clean build if you experience issues.
- Update your iOS Pods.
- For blank recordings for mobile session replay, be sure to set up the [Widget and Observer](/docs/session-replay/installation?tab=Flutter#widget-and-observer-setup).
- For blank recordings for flutter web session replay, be sure to enable [Canvas capture](/docs/session-replay/canvas-recording).

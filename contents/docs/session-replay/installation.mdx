Session replay enables you to record users navigating through your website or mobile app and play back the individual sessions to watch how real users use your product.

> 🚧 **NOTE:** Mobile Recording is currently **only available on Android** and is considered `beta`. Check out the [Mobile Recording page](/session-replay/mobile).

## Step one: Install our JavaScript web library

If you already have our JavaScript library or snippet installed, you can skip this step.

import JSInstallWeb from "../integrate/\_snippets/install-web.mdx"

<JSInstallWeb />

## Step two: Enable session recordings in your project settings

Enable session recordings in your PostHog [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

![Enable session recordings in your PostHog](../../images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings.png)

Once enabled, the library will start recording sessions by default.

They can be toggled off in the by setting the `disable_session_recording: true` flag in the [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config). 

Users who [opt out](/docs/libraries/js#opt-users-out) of event capturing will not have their sessions recorded.

> **Note on using Segment's SDK**: Session Replay does not work if you send data using [Segment's SDK](/docs/libraries/segment) as this data is not collected. If you use Segment, you may want to add the PostHog library as well – (make sure to only send regular event data from one source).

## How to ignore sensitive elements

You may want to hide sensitive text or elements in your replays. See our [privacy controls](/docs/session-replay/privacy) docs for how to do this.

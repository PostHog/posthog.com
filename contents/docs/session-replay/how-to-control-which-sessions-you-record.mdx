If you want control over which sessions to record:

1. Set `disable_session_recording: true` in your [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config).

2. Manually start recording by calling `posthog.startSessionRecording()`. Similarly, you can stop the recording at any point by calling `posthog.stopSessionRecording()`.

You can then achieve even finer control by combining the above methods with [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags). This enables you to control session recordings based on user or group properties. You can also use feature flags to capture a percentage of all sessions.

For example:

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    disable_session_recording: true,
    // ... other options
})
posthog.onFeatureFlags(function () {
    if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('your-feature-flag')) {
        posthog.startSessionRecording()
    }
})
```

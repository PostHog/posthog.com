There are several ways to control which sessions you record with the Web JavaScript SDK:

## Programmatically start and stop recordings

> Note: For mobile replay controls, see [iOS](/docs/session-replay/privacy?tab=iOS#handling-sensitive-third-party-screens), and [Android](/docs/session-replay/privacy?tab=Android#handling-sensitive-third-party-screens) privacy controls section. Support for this method in React Native and Flutter is planned — track progress [here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/issues/2169).

1. For older projects, there is a section for 'Authorized domains for replay' in the [project replay settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/environment-replay#replay-authorized-domains). Ensure your domain is added if the section is present.


2. Set `disable_session_recording: true` in your [config](/docs/libraries/js/config).

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
  api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
  defaults: '<ph_posthog_js_defaults>',
    disable_session_recording: true,
    // ... other options
})
```

3. Manually start recording by calling `posthog.startSessionRecording()`. Similarly, you can stop the recording at any point by calling `posthog.stopSessionRecording()`.

By default, `startSessionRecording` obeys any ingestion controls you've set - so you might call start and not record a session because of sampling or some other control.

You can pass override options to `startSessionRecording` to change this. 

```
posthog.startSessionRecording(true) // start ignoring all ingestion controls
posthog.startSessionRecording({
  // you don't have to send all of these
  sampling: true || false; 
  linked_flag: true || false; 
  url_trigger: true || false; 
  event_trigger: true || false 
})
```

## With URL trigger conditions

You can opt to only start recordings once your user visits a certain page. After the URL matches, the recording continues even after they leave the matching page.  
The client keeps a short buffer in-memory, so you'll still be able to see how they have arrived at the page.

## With Event trigger conditions

Since posthog-js version 1.186.0, you can opt to only start recordings once your user emits a particular event. After the event is captured, the recording continues even after they leave the matching page.  
The client keeps a short buffer in-memory, so you'll still be able to see how they have arrived at the event.

## With feature flags

You can select a [feature flag](/docs/feature-flags) to control whether to record sessions or not. Recordings will only be collected for users when the flag is enabled for them.

1. [Create a boolean or multiple variant flag](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags) that determines whether to record sessions or not.
2. Go to the [replay ingestion settings page](https://us.posthog.com/replay/settings#selectedSetting=replay-triggers).
3. Link your newly created flag in the **Enable recordings using feature flag**.

## Sampling

Sampling enables you to record a percentage of all sessions. To set a sampling rate, go to the [replay ingestion settings page](https://us.posthog.com/replay/settings#selectedSetting=replay-triggers).

<ProductScreenshot

    imageDark={ImgSampleConfigDark}
    alt="Sampling config shown set to 100% i.e. no sampling" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

Our recommendation is to start with capturing 100% of sessions and decrease it as needed. This helps you get a sense of how many sessions you’re recording and how much data you’re collecting.

> **Note:** Sampling reduces the number of sessions you record, but it doesn’t let you control which sessions are recorded.

## Combining controls

Since version 1.238.0 of the web SDK you can control how multiple triggers are combined. Choosing whether recording will start when all triggers match or when any trigger matches.

For example if you set an event trigger for Exception events, a URL trigger for the checkout page, and sampling to 20%.

### With any matching

You'll capture 20% of every session, and any session that has an exception event or is on the checkout page.

### With all matching

You'll capture 20% of any session on the checkout page that has an exception event.

## Minimum duration

In your [replay ingestion settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay-ingestion), you can set a minimum duration for sessions to be recorded. 

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={ImgMinDurationLight} 
    imageDark={ImgMinDurationDark}
    alt="Minimum duration config shown set to 2 seconds" 
    classes="rounded"
/>

This is useful if you want to exclude sessions that are too short to be useful. For example, you might want to exclude sessions that are less than 2 seconds long to avoid recording sessions where users quickly bounce off your site.

### Limitations


The minimum duration is set in seconds. Whenever a new session starts, the browser records the start time. If the minimum duration has passed since the start time, the session data is sent. If it hasn't, the session continues to be buffered in-memory. 

This means that if you set a high minimum duration and your user visits multiple pages each for a short time, the browser risks dropping the buffered data. The result is that the session is still recorded, but you miss the beginning.

If you find you are missing the beginning of sessions, reduce the minimum duration to fix this.

## Billing Limits

You can set a [billing limit](/docs/billing/limits-alerts). We'll stop ingesting recordings when you reach your limit.

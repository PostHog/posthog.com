If you want control over which sessions to record:

# With feature flags

You can select a [feature flag](/docs/feature-flags) to control whether to record sessions or not. Recordings will only be collected for users when the flag is enabled for them.

1. Create a boolean flag that you can use to control whether to record sessions or not.
2. Visit your [replay ingestion settings page](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay-ingestion).
3. Select that flag in the "Enable recordings using feature flag" dropdown menu.

# With your own code

1. Set `disable_session_recording: true` in your [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config).

2. Manually start recording by calling `posthog.startSessionRecording()`. Similarly, you can stop the recording at any point by calling `posthog.stopSessionRecording()`.

3. **Important** make sure the your domain is added to the [Authorized Domains list](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay-authorized-domains) as otherwise the data will still be ignored as it is ingested by our servers.

For example:

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    disable_session_recording: true,
    // ... other options
})

// some time later based on a trigger in your system
posthog.startSessionRecording()
```

If you already use this mechanism to control session recordings using feature flags you can link the feature flag (as above) and delete your manual handling code.

For more examples of controlling  which sessions you record, see our tutorial on [how to only record the sessions you want](/tutorials/limit-session-recordings).

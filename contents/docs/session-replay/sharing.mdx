title: Sharing or embedding recordings
---

Recordings are typically consumed from the `Session Replay` part of PostHog but in some cases you may want to share specific Recordings with people outside of your PostHog Organization.

> Above is an embedded recording of posthog.com ...in posthog.com  - very meta.


## Sharing via the UI

When viewing any recording you can press `Share` and from their you can configure the recording for public 


## Sharing via the API

A more advanced use case may be automating this process, for example if you want to automatically embed particular recordings in some sort of support tool whenever a user reports a bug.

1. Retrieve the `$session_id` of the recording you want to share.

```js
// Frontend - where the recording is taking place
const sessionID = posthog.get_session_id()
// You need to handle sending this to your backend
sendToSupportTool(sessionID)
```


2. Once you have the `session_id`, in your backend you can use your [Personal API Key](/docs/api#personal-api-keys-recommended) to enable that recording for sharing

```node
const projectID = 123 // Found in Project Settings
const sessionID = '{FROM_STEP_1}'
const url = `https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/${projectID}/session_recordings/${sessionID}/sharing?personal_api_key=${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}`

const response = axios.post(url, {
    enabled: true,
})



// Frontend - where the recording is taking place
const sessionID = posthog.get_session_id()
// You need to handle sending this to your backend
sendToSupportTool(sessionID)
```

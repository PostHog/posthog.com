title: Sharing or embedding session replays
---

Replays are typically viewed in **[Session Replay](https://app.posthog.com/replay)** part of PostHog. However, in some cases you may want to share specific recordings with people outside of your PostHog organization. To do this, PostHog enables you to share recordings in two different ways:
<iframe allowfullscreen width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0" src="https://app.posthog.com/embedded/VDVn0WRlvJdBomoFyy2Xg0Di2T1pEg"></iframe>

> Above is an embedded recording of posthog.com ... on posthog.com  - very meta.
## Method one: Sharing via the PostHog app

When viewing any recording you can press `Share` and from there you can configure the recording for **external sharing**. There are some configuration options for the iframe as well as the ability to specify that it should start at a particular timestamp.

## Method two: Sharing via the PostHog API

A more advanced use case may be automating this process, for example if you want to automatically embed particular recordings in some sort of support tool whenever a user reports a bug.

1. Retrieve the `$session_id` of the recording you want to share.

```js
// Frontend - where the recording is taking place
const sessionID = posthog.get_session_id()
// You need to handle sending this to your backend
sendToSupportTool(sessionID)
```


2. Once you have the `session_id`, in your backend you can use your [Personal API Key](/docs/api#personal-api-keys-recommended) to enable that recording for sharing

```node
// Node.JS backend example
const projectID = 123 // Found in Project Settings
const sessionID = '{FROM_STEP_1}'
const url = `https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/${projectID}/session_recordings/${sessionID}/sharing?personal_api_key=${POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY}`

const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    enabled: true,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json;',
  },
}).then((res) => res.json())

// You can also always get the access token again by calling the same endpoint
// const response = await fetch(url).then((res) => res.json())

const accessToken = response.accessToken
```

3. Now you can use this access token as part of the iframe embed code.

```html
<iframe 
  allowfullscreen 
  width="100%" 
  height="450" 
  frameborder="0" 
  src="https://app.posthog.com/embedded/{accessToken}">
</iframe>
```

## Limitations

Playback of recordings has some limitations when embedded.
1. We can make **no guarantees** about sensitive information contained in the recording. We recommend you only sharing recordings that you are certain contain no sensitive information or embed them only where authorized users would see them.
2. Events will not be shown as they are loaded from a separate endpoint that is not accessible from the embedded iframe.
3. To playback certain things properly like fonts or images, the same policies apply as for playing back within PostHog. See [here](/docs/session-replay/troubleshooting#replay-of-recording-looks-incorrect--buggy) for more details.

Session Replay allows you to record users navigating through your website and play back the individual sessions to watch how real users use your product.

## Enabling session replay

Replay can only be used with our [JavaScript library](/docs/integrate/client/js) and requires the feature to be enabled in PostHog's Project Settings (`/project/settings`).
Once enabled, the JS library will start recording sessions by default.

<blockquote class="warning-note">
    Session Replay does not work if you send data using Segment's SDK as this data is not collected. If you use
    Segment, you may want to add the PostHog library too (make sure to only send regular event data from one source).
</blockquote>

Replay can be toggled on and off in the JS library by appropriately setting the [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config). Users who opt out of event capturing will not have their sessions recorded.

To watch recordings, you can either visit the 'Replay' page or click on any data point in an insight and from the list of persons related to that data point. This is specially useful in funnels, where you can drill down and watch recordings of users who converted or dropped off.

When watching replays, you can change the speed as well as select the option 'skip inactive' - this will skip chunks of the recording where the user was inactive on the page.

## Ignoring sensitive elements

See [Privacy Controls](/docs/session-replay/privacy) for detailed options for redacting sensitive elements.


## Console logs recording

PostHog can also capture console logs from your application. This is useful for debugging, providing extra context on what is happening in your users browser environment. As console logs can contain sensitive information we do not capture these logs automatically. You can enable this feature globally from your PostHog [project settings page](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings) or client-side by setting `enable_recording_console_log` in our [JavaScript library config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config) to `true`.

Console logs will be recorded if _either_ the project setting **or** the client-side config is set to `true`. If recordings overall are disabled then console logs will also not be recorded.

```javascript
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    // REMINDER: This is only needed if you aren't using the project settings config
    enable_recording_console_log: true,
    // ... other options
})
```

## Network recording

PostHog can capture network requests that occur during the browser session so you can see the effect of slow network requests or errors on the user experience.

These network request can be modified before capture to remove sensitive information from the URL like so.

```javascript
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    session_recording: {
        maskNetworkRequestFn: (request) => {
            // For example: ignoring a request entirely
            if (request.url.includes('example.com')) {
                return null
            }

            // ... or remove the query string from the URL
            request.url = request.url.split('?')[0]
            return request
        }
    }
})
```


## Further controls

If you want more granular controls, you can choose to enable session recording using [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags). This enables you to control session recordings based on users with certain previous events/actions or properties (or just to capture a percentage of all sessions).

To do this set `disable_session_recording` in our [JavaScript library config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config) to `true`.

Then conditionally call the method `posthog.startSessionRecording` to enable it using the feature flag.

For example:

```javascript
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_instance_address>',
    disable_session_recording: true,
    // ... other options
})
window.posthog.onFeatureFlags(function () {
    if (window.posthog.isFeatureEnabled('your-feature-flag')) {
        window.posthog.startSessionRecording()
    }
})
```

Equally you can stop the recording at any point via:

```
posthog.stopSessionRecording()
```

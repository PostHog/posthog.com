## Step 1: Install our JavaScript web library

First, you need to install our JavaScript library. You can do so by either:

import Snippet from "../../../integrate/\_snippets/install-js-snippet.mdx"
import Badge from "../../../getting-started/\_snippets/badge.mdx"
import InstallJSViaNPM from "../../../integrate/\_snippets/install-js-via-npm.mdx"

### Option one: Add JavaScript snippet to your HTML <Badge>Recommended</Badge>

<Snippet />

### Option two: Install via package manager

<InstallJSViaNPM />

## Step 2: Enable recordings in your project settings

Enable session recordings in your PostHog [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

![Enable session recordings in your PostHog](../../images/docs/session-replay/enable-session-replay-in-project-settings.png)

Once enabled, the library will start recording sessions by default.

They can be toggled off in the by setting the `disable_session_recording: true` flag in the [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config). 

Users who [opt out](/docs/libraries/js#opt-users-out) of event capturing will not have their sessions recorded.

> **Note on using Segment's SDK**: Session Replay does not work if you send data using [Segment's SDK](/docs/libraries/segment) as this data is not collected. If you use Segment, you may want to add the PostHog library as well – (make sure to only send regular event data from one source).

## How to ignore sensitive elements

You may want to hide sensitive text or elements in your replays. See our [privacy controls](/docs/session-replay/privacy) docs for how to do this.

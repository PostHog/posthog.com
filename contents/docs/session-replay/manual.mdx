Session Replay allows you to record users navigating through your website and play back the individual sessions to watch how real users use your product.

## Enabling session replay

Replay can only be used with our [JavaScript library](/docs/integrate/client/js) and requires the feature to be enabled in PostHog's Project Settings (`/project/settings`).
Once enabled, the JS library will start recording sessions by default.

<blockquote class="warning-note">
    Session Replay does not work if you send data using Segment's SDK as this data is not collected. If you use
    Segment, you may want to add the PostHog library too (make sure to only send regular event data from one source).
</blockquote>

Replay can be toggled on and off in the JS library by appropriately setting the [config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config). Users who opt out of event capturing will not have their sessions recorded.

To watch recordings, you can either visit the 'Replay' page or click on any data point in an insight and from the list of persons related to that data point. This is specially useful in funnels, where you can drill down and watch recordings of users who converted or dropped off.

When watching replays, you can change the speed as well as select the option 'skip inactive' - this will skip chunks of the recording where the user was inactive on the page.

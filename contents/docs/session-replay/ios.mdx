title: iOS session replay
---

> ðŸš§ **NOTE:** iOS session replay is considered `beta` and is free while in beta. We are keen to gather as much feedback as possible so if you try this out please let us know. You can send feedback via the [in-app support panel](https://us.posthog.com#panel=support%3Afeedback%3Asession_replay%3Alow) or one of our other [support options](/docs/support-options).

## Installation
[Install and configure PostHog](/docs/libraries/ios#installation) as you normally would. Ensure you've enabled session recordings in your [project settings](/docs/session-replay/installation#step-two-enable-session-recordings-in-your-project-settings) and then add `config.sessionReplay = true` to your PostHog configuration alongside any of your other configuration options.  

```swift
let config = PostHogConfig(apiKey: apiKey)
// Enable session recording. Requires enabling in your project settings as well.
// Default is false.
config.sessionReplay = true

// Whether text inputs are masked. Default is true.
// Password inputs are always masked regardless
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllTextInputs = true

// Whether images are masked. Default is true.
config.sessionReplayConfig.maskAllImages = true

// Whether network requests are captured in recordings. Default is true
// Only metric-like data like speed, size, and response code are captured. 
// No data is captured from the request or response body.
config.sessionReplayConfig.captureNetworkTelemetry = true

// Whether replays are created using high quality screenshots. Default is false.
// Required for SwiftUI.
// If disabled, replays are created using wireframes instead.
// The screenshot may contain sensitive information, so use with caution
config.sessionReplayConfig.screenshotMode = true
```

## Masking and redacting

Your replays may contain sensitive information. For example, if you're building a banking app you may not want to capture how much money a user has in their account. 

To replace any type of `UIView` with a redacted version in the replay, set the [accessibilityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityidentification/1623132-accessibilityidentifier) to `ph-no-capture`:

```swift
let imvProfilePhoto = UIImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
imvProfilePhoto.accessibilityIdentifier = "ph-no-capture"
```

> **Note:** This is currently not supported for SwiftUI. We're investigating the [issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/issues/162).

> **Note:** A technical issue is causing the [SwiftUI Text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/text) view to be detected as a `SwiftUI Image` view. This means that it'll be automatically masked if `maskAllImages` is set to `true`, even if the `maskAllTextInputs` is disabled. We're investigating this [issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/issues/163).


### Masking in SwiftUI

- When using the [SwiftUI TextField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/textfield) with [UITextInputTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextinputtraits), setting traits such as `TextField("Email", text: ...).keyboardType(.emailAddress)` will always be automatically masked since it's for private text.
- The [SwiftUI SecureField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/securefield) view is always automatically masked.

## Limitations

- Requires PostHog iOS SDK version >= [3.6.0](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/releases), and it's recommended to always use the latest version.
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is only supported if the `screenshotMode` option is enabled.
  - `Text` views in SwiftUI are considered images, so they are masked unless `maskAllImages` is disabled. 
- Replays are representation of the user's screen, not a video recording.
- Custom views are not fully supported if `screenshotMode` is disabled.
- WebView is not supported. A placeholder will be shown.
- React Native and Flutter for iOS aren't supported.

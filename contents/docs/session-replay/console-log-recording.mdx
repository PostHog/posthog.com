PostHog can capture console logs, info, warnings, and errors from your application. This is useful for debugging and providing extra context on what is happening in your user's browser environment. 

As console logs can contain sensitive information, we do not capture these logs automatically. You can enable this feature globally _either_ from your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay#replay) **or** client-side by setting `enable_recording_console_log: true` in our [JavaScript Web SDK config](/docs/integrate/client/js/#config).

```js-web
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {
    api_host: '<ph_client_api_host>',
    enable_recording_console_log: true, // TIP: This is only needed if you aren't configuring session replay using the project settings toggle.
    // ... other options
})
```

> **Important:** Individual console logs are truncated at 2000 characters. The rest of the log is not sent to PostHog. When truncating a log message we add `...[Truncated]` to the message.

## Viewing and searching console logs

Once enabled, you can then view captured console logs by clicking the "Inspector" button and choosing the console tab.

In that tab, you can search for specific logs with the following patterns:

| Token       | Match Type                    | Description                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `jscript`   | `fuzzy-match`                 | Items that fuzzy match `jscript`                 |
| `=scheme`   | `exact-match`                 | Items that are `scheme`                          |
| `'python`   | `include-match`               | Items that include `python`                      |
| `!ruby`     | `inverse-exact-match`         | Items that do not include `ruby`                 |
| `^java`     | `prefix-exact-match`          | Items that start with `java`                     |
| `!^earlang` | `inverse-prefix-exact-match`  | Items that do not start with `earlang`           |
| `.js$`      | `suffix-exact-match`          | Items that end with `.js`                        |
| `!.go$`     | `inverse-suffix-exact-match`  | Items that do not end with `.go`                 |

> **Important:** Revenue analytics is currently in beta. At this stage, Revenue analytics is optimized for small/medium-sized companies. If you process more than 20,000 transactions/month you might have performance issues. Similarly, at this stage we're optimized for customers running on a subscription model (mostly SaaS). If you're running a business where your revenue is not coming from recurring payments, you might find Revenue analytics to be less useful/more empty than expected.

Revenue analytics works by automatically transforming the data coming from your different revenue sources (Stripe or events) into a standardized set of [managed views](/docs/data-warehouse/views).

These views are automatically created once you [add a revenue source](/docs/revenue-analytics/getting-started).

These views are not exclusive to the revenue analytics dashboard: you can use them in other parts of PostHog where you'd be able to use views, more importantly the [SQL editor](/docs/data-warehouse/query).

There are 5 sets of views. For "events" sources they're named in the format `revenue_analytics.events.<event_name>.revenue_analytics_<view_type>` while for Data Warehouse sources they're created in the `<data_warehouse_source_name>.revenue_analytics_<view_type>`.
There's also a global `revenue_analytics.all.<view_type>` view that contains aggregated data from all the sources.

## View types

### Product

One of the most basic views is the `product` view. This view is a simple table containing the list of all products you have in your sources. For events this comes from the property you configure as the product ID, for data warehouse sources it's automatically inferred from the source.

Examples assuming one data warehouse source and one event:
- `stripe.prod.revenue_analytics_product`
- `revenue_analytics.events.product_purchased.revenue_analytics_product`
- `revenue_analytics.all.revenue_analytics_product`

### Charge

The `cgarge` view is a very low-level table displaying all of the charges you've made. It does not aggregate data by any means and simply exposes the data we're collecting from your sources in standardized fashion. This table also handles converting the data from the original currency to your [reporting currency](/docs/getting-started#choosing-your-reporting-currency).

Examples:
- `stripe.prod.revenue_analytics_charge`
- `revenue_analytics.events.product_purchased.revenue_analytics_charge`
- `revenue_analytics.all.revenue_analytics_charge`

You can look at the table schema in the [SQL editor](/docs/data-warehouse/query).

### Customer

The `customer` view is a table containing the list of all customers you have in your sources. For events this is automatically inferred from the `distinct_id`/`$group_key` person/group connected to the event. For data warehouse sources it's automatically inferred from the source's own source of truth for customers.

Examples:
- `stripe.prod.revenue_analytics_customer`
- `revenue_analytics.events.product_purchased.revenue_analytics_customer`
- `revenue_analytics.all.revenue_analytics_customer`

You can look at the table schema in the [SQL editor](/docs/data-warehouse/query).

For data warehouse sources, you might wanna connect these customers to your `persons` or `groups` table in the [revenue analytics settings](/docs/revenue-analytics/connecting-revenue-to-customers) to be able to track MRR/revenue for specific customers.

### Subscription

The `subscription` view is a table containing the list of all subscriptions you have in your sources. For events this will only be tracked once you've [configured a subscription property](/docs/revenue-analytics/getting-started#choosing-your-revenue-data-sources). For data warehouse sources it's automatically inferred if you connect a subscription to your invoices.

Examples:
- `stripe.prod.revenue_analytics_subscription`
- `revenue_analytics.events.product_purchased.revenue_analytics_subscription`
- `revenue_analytics.all.revenue_analytics_subscription`

You can look at the table schema in the [SQL editor](/docs/data-warehouse/query).

### Revenue Item

The `revenue_item` view is a table containing the list of all revenue items you have in your sources. It applies [deferred revenue](/docs/revenue-analytics/deferred-revenue) and [currency conversion](/docs/revenue-analytics/faq#how-do-you-convert-revenue-in-different-currencies) to the data automatically.

This data is inferred automatically both from your events and data warehouse sources. For data warehouse sources we consider all of your invoices plus all of your invoiceless charges. You can omit invoiceless charges in the [settings](/docs/revenue-analytics/getting-started#choosing-your-revenue-data-sources).

Examples:
- `stripe.prod.revenue_analytics_revenue_item`
- `revenue_analytics.events.product_purchased.revenue_analytics_revenue_item`
- `revenue_analytics.all.revenue_analytics_revenue_item`

You can look at the table schema in the [SQL editor](/docs/data-warehouse/query).

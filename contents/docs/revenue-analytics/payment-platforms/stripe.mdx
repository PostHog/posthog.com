When using revenue analytics, you can connect Stripe to PostHog as a source of revenue data. Revenue analytics will automatically use the data from Stripe to build your [revenue dashboard](/docs/revenue-analytics/dashboard).

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Already have a Stripe-connected source?" type="fyi">

If you already have a Stripe-connected source, you can access the [revenue analytics settings](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue) page and turn on the **Stripe** toggle to connect to your Stripe data.

## How is the data stored?

Your data will be imported and transformed into a set of [managed views](/docs/revenue-analytics/managed-views). Revenue analytics will use these views to build your [revenue dashboard](/docs/revenue-analytics/dashboard) automatically.

You can also use these views in the [SQL editor](/docs/data-warehouse/query) to run custom queries and visualize the data.

## Deferred revenue

PostHog will automatically defer revenue recognition to match your accounting practices. This means we spread the revenue across all the months a charge is relevant for. You can read more about this on the [deferred revenue](/docs/revenue-analytics/deferred-revenue) page.

## Connect to customers

You can link your Stripe customers to your [persons](/docs/persons) and [groups](/docs/groups) in PostHog. This helps you identify your top customers and see how much revenue they're generating.

You can learn more about this on the [connect to customers](/docs/revenue-analytics/connect-to-customers) page.

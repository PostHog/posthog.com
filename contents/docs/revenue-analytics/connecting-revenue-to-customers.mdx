You can connect your revenue data to `persons` and `groups` in the [revenue analytics settings](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

This is automatically done when you're using revenue events (since we know what person/group an event belongs to) but we need your help to manually map them in case you're using a data warehouse source.

Once this is connected you'll be able to properly see who your top customers are in the [Top customers dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/revenue_analytics#top-customers).

You'll also get access to the `persons_revenue_analytics` and `groups_revenue_analytics` tables in the [data warehouse](https://app.posthog.com/data-warehouse). This is a simple map of `person_id`/`group_key` to what their all-time revenue is. We plan on expanding that soon with more fields and also making that data available on the soon-to-be-released [CRM](/teams/crm) page.

```sql
-- Count the number of persons with revenue greater than 1,000,000
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM persons_revenue_analytics
WHERE amount > 1000000
```

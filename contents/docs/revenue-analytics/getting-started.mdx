Revenue tracking enables you to capture revenue from your application via the events you are already sending us, or via an integration between your payment platform and our data warehouse, which you can then track in your [revenue analytics dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/revenue_analytics).

You can start tracking revenue by doing the following:

1. Choosing your reporting currency
2. Configuring your revenue data source

## Choosing your reporting currency

PostHog will automatically convert revenue from other currencies into your chosen reporting currency. For example, if someone makes a purchase in Canadian Dollars (CAD) and your reporting currency is US Dollars (USD), PostHog converts it into USD to ensure consistency.

You can configure your reporting currency at the top of your [revenue analytics settings](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

## Configuring your revenue data sources

Next, you need to tell PostHog where to find your revenue data. PostHog can collect revenue from two different types of sources:

- [Connecting to a data warehouse source like Stripe](/docs/revenue-analytics/getting-started?tab=Data+warehouse+tables#data-warehouse-tables)
- [Collecting events with revenue properties](/docs/revenue-analytics/getting-started?tab=Event+properties#properties-on-events)

import Tab from "components/Tab"

### Data warehouse tables

The simplest way to send us revenue data is from your [data warehouse](/data-warehouse) tables.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Screenshot_2025_09_05_at_14_18_19_eeec8127a9.png" 
    imageDark="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Screenshot_2025_09_05_at_14_18_30_c7ad45d637.png"
    alt="Data warehouse tables setup"
    classes="rounded"
/>

The configuration for these are simple. Create a connection between PostHog and your revenue source and PostHog will automatically pick up the revenue data for you.
Please refer to the [data warehouse docs](/data-warehouse) for more information.

> **Important:** We currently only support revenue analytics data from Stripe. The Chargebee connector already exists and integration with revenue analytics is coming soon. We'll also implement integrations with RevenueCat and Polar in the near future. Check our roadmap at [our team page](/teams/revenue-analytics).

<details>
    <summary>Deferred revenue</summary>
    <p>
        When using revenue data from your data warehouse (from sources like Stripe), PostHog will automatically defer revenue recognition to match your accounting practices. This means we'll spread the revenue across all the months a charge is relevant for.
        You can learn more about this on the [deferred revenue](/docs/revenue-analytics/deferred-revenue) page.

### Properties on events

Another way to send us revenue data is through revenue generating events, such as when a purchase is completed, a user starts a subscription, or a subscription is renewed.

When you do so, you need to include two properties:

| Property | Description | Example key | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue property | The amount of revenue generated by the event (usually in their minor unit, such as cents of a dollar, pence of a pound, yen, etc.) | `revenue` | `1000` |
| Currency property (optional) | The currency of the revenue in [ISO 4217 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) - or select a static currency for all events | `currency` | `USD` |
| Product property (optional) | The name of the product that the event is related to | `product` | `Premium Plan` |
| Coupon property (optional) | The name of the coupon that was used to purchase the product | `coupon` | `SUMMER2024` |
| Subscription property (optional) | An unique identifier for the subscription that the event is related to | `subscription_id` | `sub_1234` |

<MultiLanguage>

```js
posthog.capture("purchase_completed", {
    revenue: 1000,
    currency: "USD",
    product: "Premium Plan",
    coupon: "SUMMER2024",
    subscription_id: "sub_1234"
})
```

```json
{
    "event": "purchase_completed",
    "distinct_id": "user_distinct_id",
    "properties": {
        "revenue": 1000,
        "currency": "USD",
        "product": "Premium Plan",
        "coupon": "SUMMER2024",
        "subscription_id": "sub_1234"
    }
}
```

```python
posthog.capture(
    "user_distinct_id",
    "purchase_completed",
    {
        "revenue": 1000,
        "currency": "USD",
        "product": "Premium Plan",
        "coupon": "SUMMER2024",
        "subscription_id": "sub_1234"
    }
)
```
</MultiLanguage>

You can name the properties however you want – you can customize them in the **Revenue** tab in [data management](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/revenue).

The currency property is optional but we still recommend sending it explicitly for future compatibility. You can configure a static currency in your dashboard if you only accept payment in a single currency.

If your product is subscription-based, you can also let us know how we should handle churn by specifying after how much time after the last event for a given subscription we should consider it to have churned.
You can also customize whether we consider the user to have churned the day the last event happened or after the dropoff period.

    alt="Events setup"
    classes="rounded"
/>

#### Currency minor unit

You can choose between sending the minor unit of the currency or the decimal amount. For example, the whole amount of `$20.45` (as in 20 dollars and 45 cents) would be equal to the minor unit of `2045` (as in 2,045 cents).

While we support both, we recommend sending the minor to avoid floating point precision issues.

When sending the minor unit of the currency, we'll treat it as follows:
- `1045` in `USD` (or any other two-decimal currency) is treated as $10.45
- `1045` in `JPY` (or any other [zero-decimal currency](#zero-decimal-currencies)) is treated as ¥1045

##### Zero-decimal currencies

When you enable "values are in cents" (minor unit), we consider most currencies to be two-decimal currencies unless they are in the following list:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <ul>
        <li>BIF</li>
        <li>CLP</li>
        <li>DJF</li>
        <li>GNF</li>
        <li>JPY</li>
        <li>KMF</li>
        <li>KRW</li>
        <li>MGA</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>PYG</li>
        <li>RWF</li>
        <li>UGX</li>
        <li>VND</li>
        <li>VUV</li>
        <li>XAF</li>
        <li>XOF</li>
        <li>XPF</li>
    </ul>   
</div>

There's also one exception to the day-to-day usage of each currency, and that's the Icelandic Krona (ISK). The Icelandic Krona (ISK) is a zero-decimal currency, but we treat it as a two-decimal currency to keep backwards compatibility with our integration with Stripe.

   Revenue analytics is currently works best for:
   
   1. Small to medium-sized companies
   2. Companies with subscription models (mostly SaaS)

    If you process more than 20,000 transactions per month, or your revenue comes primarily from one-off payments rather than recurring subscriptions, revenue analytics may feel less useful, slower, or provide less insight than expected.

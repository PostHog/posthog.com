title: Ingestion pipeline
---

In it's simplest form, the PostHog ingestion pipeline is a collection of services which listen for events as they are sent in, process them, and then store them for later analysis.
This document gives an overview of how data ingestion works, as well as some of the caveats to be aware of when sending events to PostHog.

## Capture API

The Capture API represents the user-facing side of the ingestion pipeline, and is exposed as a number of API routes where events can be sent.
Before an event reaches the Ingestion pipeline, there are a couple of preliminary checks that we do so that we can return a response immediately to the client.

These checks consist of:

-   Validating API keys.
-   Anonymizing IPs according to project settings.
-   Decompressing and normalizing the shape of event data for the rest of the system.
-   Sending processed to `events_plugin_ingestion` Kafka topic.
-   If communication with Postgres fails, logging events to kafka `dead_letter_queue` table.

The goal of this step is to be as simple as possible, so that we can reliably get events into the ingestion pipeline, where Kafka can persist them unti they are able to be processed.

## Ingestion

Due to the design of Clickhouse, update operations are slow and undesirable, and so the first 4 steps of the ingestion pipeline are performing operations on our raw events to get it ready to be persisted in Clickhouse.

The ingestion pipeline is made up of a number of different step:

1. [Event buffer](#1-event-buffer)
2. [Apps - `processEvent`](#2-apps---processevent)
3. [Person processing](#3-person-processing)
4. [Event processing](#4-event-processing)
5. [Writing to Clickhouse](#5-writing-to-clickhouse)
6. [Apps - `onEvent`](#6-apps---onevent)

### 1. Event buffer

The event buffer sits right at the beginning of the ingestion pipeline, and gives us the ability to selectively delay the processing of certain events.
Events are initially read from the `events_plugin_ingestion` Kafka topic, which is written to by the Capture API.

#### Why are events buffered?

Since events coming in to PostHog can arrive in any order, we sometimes decide to delay the processing of specific events to fix edge cases that can potentially arrive.
It will become more obvious why this is necessary as we dive deeper into the event pipeline.

#### Determining if an event should be buffered

After an event is conusmed from Kafka, the plugin server will check a number of things in order to determine whether or not to buffer an event.
If any of these conditions are true the event will not be buffered and will immediately move on to the [next step](#2-apps---processevent).

-   If the `distinct_id` on the event is already associated with an existing Person
-   If the event is _anonymous_ (In this case this means the `distinct_id` matches the `device_id` generated by the library that sent the event)
-   If the event is an `$identify` call
-   If the event is coming from one of our mobile libraries, as it is not easy to determine if an event is _anonymous_ and it is not worth it to buffer all events on mobile

If an event coming in satisfies none of these checks, then it will be added to the buffer and sent back through the ingestion pipeline in _at most_ 60s.

### 2. Apps - `processEvent`

After the event buffer, we start the first of a few steps that augment or transform our raw event before it gets written into Clickhouse.
This first step runs any workloads that come from [Apps](/apps) that you have installed and who have exported a `processEvent` function.
This is the only chance for apps to transform or exclude an event before it is writtend into Clickhouse.

### 3. Person processing

The next step in the ingestion pipeline is processing the Person who sent the event, which is determined by the `distinct_id` field.
A number of different actions can happend here depending both on if we've seen this `distinct_id` before, as well as which type of event is being sent.

To determine whether or not a Person and corresponding `person_id` have already been created and associated with a `distinct_id`, we make a call to PostgreSQL to retrieve the latest mappings.

#### `$identify` or `$alias` event

|                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| If we have never seen this `distinct_id` before                                                                                                 | Create a new Person and add a mapping in PostgreSQL to associate this `distinct_id` with the new `person_id` |
| If there is a single Person already associated with this user                                                                                   | Create a new mapping to associate this `distinct_id` with the already existing `person_id`                   |
| If there is already a Person associated with this `distinct_id` _and_ we have already created a second Person that is associated with this user | We will [merge these two people](#merging-two-persons) and associate all future events with the first Person |

##### Merging two Persons

In the third scenario, where we have inadvertently created two Persons for the same user, we will need to merge them. In the case of an `$identify` call, we will create a mapping from the `distinct_id` of the anonymous user to the non-anonymous user.
If there are any conflicts when merging Person properties for these two users, the values from the non-anonymous user will take precedence.
We choose to prioritize the history of the non-anonymous user, as it is far more likely that this user will have a history of previous events associated with them that we want to preserve.

In the case of an `$alias` call, we will merge the second user into the first depending on the order these users were provided to the call.

##### Consequences of merging

This scenario typically isn't ideal, as merging two users will only affect events that are sent in the future.
As a result, we will be left with two separate Persons that shoulb be associated with the same user, but instead will be treated as entirely unique users.
The only way to fully 'merge' these two people would be to go back and rewrite the `person_id` field on past events, which is not practical or performant.

Avoiding this scenario is the primary goal of the event buffer, as by buffering events from users we have never seen before, we can avoid creating a duplicate Person if it turns out they have been identified or logged in shortly after sending this first event.

On the integration side, the best way to avoid this scenario is to send `$identify` events as early as possible, which will prevent a new Person from being created.

#### All other events

For all other types of events, the process is much more straightforward.
If we have determined that this is a new `distinct_id`, then we will create a new Person and associate them with this user.
Then, if there are any `$set` or `$set_once` arguments provided on the event, we will update the Person properties in PostgreSQL based on these values.

For more information on exactly how this updating is done, check out this overview of [user properties](/docs/integrate/user-properties).

### 4. Event processing

Finally, now that we have our event and person all ready, we perform a few last processing steps before we write the event to Clickhouse.
This is our last chance to change anything about the event, which can include:

-   Adding [group properties](/manual/group-analytics) if the event has been assigned to a Group
-   Anonymizing IPs, if needed

### 5. Writing to Clickhouse

Now that we have our fully-processed event, the last step before we write to Clickhouse is to add the `person_id` and person properties to our event, both of which were determined in Step 3.
Once we have all the person properties attached, we are ready to persist our event, which is done by sending it to a separate Kafka topic that Clickhouse will consume from and then write to its tables.

For more information on exactly how events are stored in Clickhouse, check out [this reference](/docs/how-posthog-works/clickhouse)

### 6. Apps - `onEvent`

The final step in the ingestion pipeline is calling the `onEvent` handler from any apps that we have enabled. This includes all of our export apps as well as some of our alerting/monitoring apps.
It's worth noting that since this event has already been written to Clickhouse, it is effectively immutable at this point as we do not allow apps to directly update events. Any apps that need to transform events should use the `processEvent` handler.

## Kafka

Kafka is used as a resilient message bus between different services.

You can find relevant kafka topics [in the PostHog codebase](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/kafka_client/topics.py).

title: Architecture
---

The following pages in this section cover [Data model](/how-posthog-works/data-model),  [Ingestion pipeline](/how-posthog-works/ingestion-pipeline), [ClickHouse](/how-posthog-works/clickhouse) and [Querying data](/how-posthog-works/queries). 
This document gives an overview of the general architecture. How a our cloud or a deployed PostHog [Helm chart](https://github.com/PostHog/charts-clickhouse/) works on Kubernetes.

No communication is needed into or out of this namespace other than the ingress controller for app and collecting data.

Note that the specifics of this may vary:

-   ClickHouse, Kafka, PostgreSQL and Redis services may be hosted outside of the namespace or [configured differently](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
-   The ClickHouse cluster is managed by [clickhouse-operator](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/) and the
    exact number of pods vary according to [sharding settings](/docs/runbook/services/clickhouse/sharding-and-replication).

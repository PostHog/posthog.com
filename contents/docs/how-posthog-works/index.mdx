title: Architecture
---

The following pages in this section cover [Data model](/docs/how-posthog-works/data-model),  [Ingestion pipeline](/docs/how-posthog-works/ingestion-pipeline), [ClickHouse](/docs/how-posthog-works/clickhouse) and [Querying data](/docs/how-posthog-works/queries). 
This document gives an overview of the general architecture. How our cloud or a deployed PostHog [Helm chart](https://github.com/PostHog/charts-clickhouse/) works on Kubernetes.

## Zooming right out

There are only a few systems to consider. A Website and API is presented for users. An API for Client Apps. A plugin service for processing events on ingestion. And a worker service for processing events in response to triggers (e.g. timers)

    sdk[Client Apps/SDKs]
    ex[Export Sink]

No communication is needed into or out of this namespace other than the ingress controller for app and collecting data.

Note that the specifics of this may vary:

-   ClickHouse, Kafka, PostgreSQL and Redis services may be hosted outside of the namespace or [configured differently](/docs/self-host/deploy/configuration).
-   The ClickHouse cluster is managed by [clickhouse-operator](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/) and the
    exact number of pods vary according to [sharding settings](/docs/runbook/services/clickhouse/sharding-and-replication).

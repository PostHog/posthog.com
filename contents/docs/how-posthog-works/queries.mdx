## Insights counting unique persons

This section covers how PostHog determines the number of unique users who performed a certain action, such as when creating a [Trends](/manual/trends) or [Funnel](/manual/funnels) insight.
In this case, PostHog determines this number by counting the total number of unique `person_id`'s on events that match your filters.

As an example, let's say that we have the following list of events:

| ID  | Event       | `person_id` |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1   | viewed page | `user1`     |
| 2   | viewed page | `user2`     |
| 3   | viewed page | `user1`     |

> **Note: ** This isn't _exactly_ how `person_id`'s are stored within the events table, but it will help us to keep things simple.

In this case, if we ran a query asking for the number of unique users who viewed a page, we would get a result of `2`, as our table contains 2 unique `person_id`'s.

Let's look at what happens when users are merged. 
In this example case, we have a user Alice who viewed the page on day `1` from her mobile phone.
On day 2, Alice decides to view the homepage from her desktop where she isn't logged in. This results in the pageview event being associated with a newly created Person (`user2`).

| Day | Event    | distinct_id              | `person_id` |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1   | pageview | Alice                    | `user1`     |
| 2   | pageview | anon-1                   | `user2`     |

A unique persons query for pageviews would result in `2` unique users.
Let's assume Alice then on day 3 logs in to her account, which sends an identify event that merges `user2` into `user1`.

| Day | Event    | distinct_id              | `person_id` |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1   | pageview | Alice                    | `user1`     |
| 2   | pageview | anon-1                   | `user1`     |
| 3   | identify | Alice (anon-id = anon-1) | `user1`     |

A unique persons query for pageviews now results in `1` unique user.

## Filtering on person properties

This section covers how PostHog filters out events based on Person properties.

**Currently we use latest person properties and join them in during queries.** In the future (or if you have requested to have Persons On Events queries enabled) this works as follows.

Since all the properties for a person are stored on each event, the process is actually quite straightforward.

Let's walk through a simple example to see how this works in practice. Let's say we have ingested the following events:

| User ID | Event            | Subscription plan _(Property on each person)_ |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | clicked login    | `premium`                                     |
| 2       | refreshed table  | `premium`                                     |
| 3       | viewed docs      | `free`                                        |
| 3       | upgraded plan    | `enterprise`                                  |
| 3       | viewed dashboard | `enterprise`                                  |
| 4       | logged out       | `free`                                        |

> **Note: ** This isn't _exactly_ how person properties are stored within the events table, but it will help us to keep things simple. For detailed information, check out our [data model](/docs/how-posthog-works/data-model).

In this case, let's say we only want to see events from users while they were on the `premium` or `enterprise` plans.
To achieve this, we would filter based on the Subscription plan person property, which would match the following events.

| User ID | Event            | Subscription plan _(Property on each person)_ |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | clicked login    | `premium`                                     |
| 2       | refreshed table  | `premium`                                     |
| 3       | upgraded plan    | `enterprise`                                  |
| 3       | viewed dashboard | `enterprise`                                  |

You may have noticed that over the course of this period, user `3` actually upgraded from the `free` plan to the `enterprise` plan.
Despite this, the event they sent for when they viewed the docs still reflects that they were on the `free` plan at the time, and is thus filtered out.

In most cases this is exactly what we want, as it means that we can update the properties for a person without worrying about messing up our past data points!

However, if instead you do want to filter based on a person's current properties, you can do so by creating a [cohort](/manual/cohorts).

To see this let's say we want to get all events for users who are _currently_ on `enterprise` or `premium` plans.
To do this, we'll create a cohort called 'Paid users' that matches all persons who have their 'plan' property set as either `premium` or `enterprise`.

Then on the insight, we can filter by the cohort, which would match the following events.

| User ID | Event            | Subscription plan _(Property on each person)_ |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | clicked login    | `premium`                                     |
| 2       | refreshed table  | `premium`                                     |
| 3       | viewed docs      | `free`                                        |
| 3       | upgraded plan    | `enterprise`                                  |
| 3       | viewed dashboard | `enterprise`                                  |

## Filtering on group properties

Group properties work exactly the same way as person properties, and are stored on each event.

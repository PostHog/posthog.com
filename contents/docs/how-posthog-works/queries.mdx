This page provides a high-level overview of how internal queries run when creating insights in PostHog.

## Insights counting unique persons

PostHog determines unique persons in insights like [trends](/manual/trends) and [funnels](/manual/funnels) by counting the total number of unique `person_id`'s on events that match your filters.

As an example, let's say that we have the following list of events:

| ID  | Event       | `person_id` |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1   | viewed page | `user1`     |
| 2   | viewed page | `user2`     |
| 3   | viewed page | `user1`     |

> **Note: ** This isn't _exactly_ how `person_id`'s are stored within the events table, but it helps us to keep things simple.

If we ran a query asking for the number of unique users who viewed a page, we would get a result of `2`, as our table contains 2 unique `person_id`'s.

### What happens when users are merged? 

In this example case, we have a user Alice who viewed the page on day `1` from her mobile phone.

On day 2, Alice decides to view the homepage from her desktop where she isn't logged in. This results in the pageview event being associated with a newly created Person (`user2`).

| Day | Event    | distinct_id              | `person_id` |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1   | pageview | Alice                    | `user1`     |
| 2   | pageview | anon-1                   | `user2`     |

A unique persons query for pageviews would result in `2` unique users.

Let's assume Alice then on day 3 logs in to her account, which sends an identify event that merges `user2` into `user1`.

| Day | Event    | distinct_id              | `person_id` |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1   | pageview | Alice                    | `user1`     |
| 2   | pageview | anon-1                   | `user1`     |
| 3   | identify | Alice (anon-id = anon-1) | `user1`     |

A unique persons query for pageviews now results in `1` unique user.

## Filtering on person properties

This section covers how PostHog filters out events based on person properties.

> **Note:** If you signed up before June 2024, you can configure in [settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-product-analytics#persons-on-events) to use the faster queries mode instead of joining with the person table for current properties. This is the default for users signed up after June 2024.

Since all the properties for a person are stored on each event, the process is straightforward.

Let's walk through a simple example to see how this works in practice. Let's say we have ingested the following events:

| User ID | Event            | Subscription plan _(property on each person)_ |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | clicked login    | `premium`                                     |
| 2       | refreshed table  | `premium`                                     |
| 3       | viewed docs      | `free`                                        |
| 3       | upgraded plan    | `enterprise`                                  |
| 3       | viewed dashboard | `enterprise`                                  |
| 4       | logged out       | `free`                                        |

> **Note:** This isn't _exactly_ how person properties are stored within the events table, but it will help us to keep things simple. For detailed information, check out our [data model](/docs/how-posthog-works/data-model).

In this case, let's say we only want to see events from users while they were on the `premium` or `enterprise` plans.

To achieve this, we filter based on the `Subscription plan` person property, which would match the following events.

| User ID | Event            | Subscription plan _(Property on each person)_ |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | clicked login    | `premium`                                     |
| 2       | refreshed table  | `premium`                                     |
| 3       | upgraded plan    | `enterprise`                                  |
| 3       | viewed dashboard | `enterprise`                                  |

You may have noticed that user `3` actually upgraded from the `free` plan to the `enterprise` plan over this period. Despite this, the event they sent for when they viewed the docs still reflects that they were on the `free` plan at the time, and is thus filtered out.

In most cases, this is exactly what we want, as it means that we can update the properties for a person without worrying about messing up our past data points.
However, if instead you do want to filter based on a person's current properties, you can do so by using `pdi.person.properties.<property>` in HogQL or creating a [cohort](/manual/cohorts). Note that this is slower than filtering on person properties.

### Filtering with cohorts

To show this, let's say we want to get all events for users who are _currently_ on `enterprise` or `premium` plans.

To do this, we'll create a cohort called 'Paid users' that matches all persons who have their 'plan' property set as either `premium` or `enterprise`.

On the insight, we can then filter by the cohort, which would match the following events.

| User ID | Event            | Subscription plan _(Property on each person)_ |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | clicked login    | `premium`                                     |
| 2       | refreshed table  | `premium`                                     |
| 3       | viewed docs      | `free`                                        |
| 3       | upgraded plan    | `enterprise`                                  |
| 3       | viewed dashboard | `enterprise`                                  |

## Filtering on group properties

Group properties work the same way as person properties, and are stored on each event.

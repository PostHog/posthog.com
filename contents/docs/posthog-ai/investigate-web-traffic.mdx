This guide shows you how the PostHog team uses PostHog AI to investigate web traffic. It includes a video demo and the prompts used to create insights, build dashboards, and analyze data from [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) and [session replays](/docs/session-replay).

This demo example uses our own internal PostHog project. The results will differ based on your project's specific setup and the data that's available to PostHog AI.

import { IconSparkles } from '@posthog/icons'

It's hard to find time to watch all your session replays, but you don't want to miss out on the insights. PostHog AI can summarize your session replays for you, identifying patterns, errors, and identify key summaries for you to review.

## Summarizing session replays

In the [in-app chat](/docs/posthog-ai/chat), you can ask PostHog AI to summarize your session replays. PostHog AI will pick up on the filters you've applied to the session replays and use them to summarize the replays.

PostHog AI will categorize the replays by behavior patterns and generate a summary report for you to review. You can always ask PostHog AI more questions about the session replays, and to identify specific replays for you to review.

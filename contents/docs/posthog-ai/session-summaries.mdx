---

import { IconSparkles } from '@posthog/icons'

It's hard to find time to watch all your session recordings, but you don't want to miss out on the insights. PostHog AI can summarize your recordings for you, identifying patterns, errors, and identify key summaries for you to review.

## Summarizing session replay recordings

In the [in-app chat](/docs/posthog-ai/chat), you can ask PostHog AI to summarize your session recordings. PostHog AI will pick up on the filters you've applied to the session recordings and use them to summarize the recordings.

PostHog AI will categorize the recordings by behavior patterns and generate a summary report for you to review. You can always ask PostHog AI more questions about the session recordings, and to identify specific recordings for you to review.

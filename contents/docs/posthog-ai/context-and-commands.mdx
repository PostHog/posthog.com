## Commands

## Add context to PostHog AI

You can help PostHog AI give better answers by adding context to your conversation. Click the **Add context** button to add:

- Insights from anywhere in your project, or from the current page you're viewing
- Dashboards with all their insights
- Events and actions from your data model

When you add context, PostHog AI can reference the specific queries, filters, and data from those items when answering your questions. Context automatically resets when you navigate to a different page, but persists as you move around the same page. You can also manually remove context items.

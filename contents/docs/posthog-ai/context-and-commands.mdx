## Adding context

PostHog AI automatically detects the active tab or page you're on to infer context. But you can also manually add other data points from your project for PostHog AI to reference as context.

Click the **@ Add context** button in the chat to include:

- Insights like trends, funnels, retention, etc.
- Events and actions from your data model
- Dashboards with insights

## How can I disable AI in PostHog?

If an org admin has previously approved AI features, but you'd prefer them disabled (and are an org admin too), you can disable PostHog AI and all AI data analysis in your organization settings. To do this:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **General**
2. Find the **PostHog AI data analysis** section ([direct link](http://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-details#organization-ai-consent))
3. Toggle the switch to "off"

When disabled, PostHog AI won't be available and no data will be shared with AI providers. This can be reversed at any time.

## Can I hide PostHog AI?

There currently isn't a toggle to _hide_ AI features altogether. However, in any case, only org admins can approve AI features in the organization – so there's no risk of data being sent to any AI provider without explicit consent.

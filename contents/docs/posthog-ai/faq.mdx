## What access does PostHog AI have to my data?

While working with PostHog AI, you will certainly share some information with it. Data analysis is a core feature. When doing research, PostHog AI can read the following data in your project:

- Events, persons, sessions, groups
- Actions and cohorts
- Event and property definitions
- Data warehouse schema
- Saved insights and dashboards

PostHog AI respects your project's [access controls](/docs/settings/access-control). You can only access insights and dashboards you have permission to view.

Based on that context, PostHog AI comes up with queries, runs them, and summarizes the results. Those results can be as high-level as a single number, or as detailed as a list of users with all their properties.

## Is my data shared with third parties?

We use third-party providers to power PostHog AI, so messages and all data accessed by PostHog AI (see list above) are passed through them.

Our list of data subprocessors includes:

- OpenAI and Anthropic – responsible for the core of PostHog AI's functionality, have access to user messages and all data types.
- Azure – responsible for semantic search across PostHog, has access to actions and cohorts (including their filters)

Other providers that are not data subprocessors:

- Perplexity – responsible for providing context about your product and/or company, has access to domain name (for websites) or application bundle ID (for mobile applications). We do not send any of your data.

## How can I disable PostHog AI?

With [admin permissions](/docs/settings/access-control) for your organization, you can disable PostHog AI and all AI data analysis in your [organization settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-details#organization-ai-consent).

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **General**
2. Find the **PostHog AI data analysis** section
3. Toggle the switch to "off"

When disabled, PostHog AI won't be available and no data will be shared with AI providers. This can be reversed at any time.

## Can I hide PostHog AI?

There currently isn't a toggle to _hide_ AI features altogether. However, in any case, only org admins can approve AI features in the organization – so there's no risk of data being sent to any AI provider without explicit consent.

## Is my chat history retained if I disable and re-enable PostHog AI? 

Yes, PostHog AI retains your chat history.

## Can I self-host PostHog AI and use my own models?

No, PostHog AI is only available in the cloud-hosted [PostHog app](https://app.posthog.com), which uses third-party LLM providers. PostHog automatically selects the most efficient model for each AI feature.

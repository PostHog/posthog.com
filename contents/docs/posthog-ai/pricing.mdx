AI features in PostHog consume **AI credits**. Each time you interact with an AI-powered feature – whether you're asking PostHog AI to write SQL, summarize data, or analyze sessions – credits are spent based on the resources required to complete your request.

This means you pay for what you use. There’s no fixed subscription and every organization gets a monthly free tier worth $20 (2,000 AI credits) to explore PostHog AI's features.

For reference, **1,000 AI credits = $10**.

We apply a simple, consistent 20% markup over the underlying LLM provider’s cost. So 1 PostHog AI credit corresponds to $0.008333 of raw inference.

## What consumes AI credits

AI credits are consumed whenever PostHog performs intelligent work for you. You’ll spot these features by the <span className="inline-block"><IconSparkles className="h-4 w-4" /></span> icon or when using the in-app chat.

Examples include:

- Searching for session recordings in natural language  
- Summarizing experiment results  
- Writing or debugging SQL with AI

## What doesn't consume AI credits

Getting help on how to use PostHog (i.e., asking questions about our docs) does not use AI credits.

AI features in beta are also free to use.

## How AI credit usage works

AI credits are based on the **underlying token costs**, which reflect the effort required to complete your request.

- Simple queries like "What were my daily active users in October?" use very few tokens, and therefore very few credits.
- More complex tasks like analyzing hundreds of session recordings or rewriting a SQL query multiple times use more tokens and consume more credits.
- PostHog automatically selects the most efficient model for each AI feature. 

While exact usage varies, credit consumption usually scales with complexity – more advanced tasks cost more but can deliver deeper insights and time savings. You’ll always see **real-time cost information** while using AI features.

## Control your AI credit spend

You’re always in control of your AI credit usage:

- **Real-time tracking:** See costs as you go  
- **Custom billing limit:** Set hard caps to prevent overspending
- **Default billing limit:** PostHog sets a default $150 billing limit so you don't accidentally rack up costs without a ceiling 
- **Usage alerts:** Get notified when you hit key thresholds

AI features in PostHog consume **AI credits**. Each time you interact with an AI-powered feature – like asking PostHog to write SQL, summarize data, or analyze sessions – credits are used based on the effort required to complete your request.

This means you pay for what you actually use. There’s no fixed subscription and every organization has a free tier worth $25 (2,500 credits) to explore PostHog AI's features.

## What consumes AI credits

AI credits are consumed whenever PostHog performs intelligent work for you. You’ll spot these features by the <span className="inline-block"><IconSparkles className="h-4 w-4" /></span> icon or when using the in-app chat.

Examples include:

- Searching for session recordings in natural language  
- Summarizing experiment results  
- Writing or debugging SQL with AI  

## What doesn't consume credits

Getting help on how to use PostHog never costs credits. All AI features still in beta are also free to use — as of **Oct 31**, that includes **session summaries** and **deep research**.

## How credit usage works

AI credits are based on the **underlying token costs**, which reflect the effort required to complete your request.

- Simple queries like "What were my daily active users in October?" use very few tokens, and therefore very few credits.
- More complex tasks like analyzing hundreds of session recordings or rewriting a SQL query multiple times use more tokens and consume more credits.  

While exact usage varies, credit consumption usually scales with complexity – more advanced tasks cost more but can deliver deeper insights and time savings. You’ll always see **real-time cost information** while using AI features.

PostHog automatically selects the most efficient model for each AI feature. We apply a simple, consistent 20% markup over the underlying LLM provider’s cost. For example, 1 PostHog AI credit equals $0.008333 of raw inference, and 1,000 credits cost $10.

| Example interaction | Estimated credit cost |
| --- | --- |
| "What are my daily active users in October?" | coming soon |
| "Show me session recordings for this organization_id" | coming soon |
| "Can you help me write a SQL query that…" | coming soon |

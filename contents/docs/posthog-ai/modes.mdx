title: PostHog AI modes
---

PostHog AI uses specialized modes to handle different types of analysis tasks. Each mode is optimized with specific tools and capabilities for its domain.

When you ask a question, the agent selects the most appropriate mode based on your request, or you can be in a specific mode based on the page you're viewing. The agent can switch between modes automatically based on your needs, and context is preserved when switching.

## How mode switching works

The agent can switch modes in two ways:

1. **Automatic switching** - When your request requires tools from a different mode, the agent will switch automatically. For example, if you're in Product analytics mode and ask to "run a custom SQL query", the agent will switch to SQL mode.

2. **Manual switching** - You can explicitly select a mode with the mode selector above the chat input.

When switching modes:
- Your conversation history is preserved
- The agent gains access to the new mode's specialized tools
- The agent maintains context about what you were working on

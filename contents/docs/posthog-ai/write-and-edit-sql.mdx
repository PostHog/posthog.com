import WistiaEmbed from 'components/WistiaEmbed'

This guide shows you how the PostHog team uses PostHog AI to write and edit SQL queries. It includes a video demo and the prompts used to explore data directly within our SQL editor and [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse).

This demo example uses our own internal PostHog project. The results will differ based on your project's specific setup and the data that's available to PostHog AI.

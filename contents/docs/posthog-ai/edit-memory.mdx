## Run /init command

To get started, we recommend running the [`/init`](https://app.posthog.com/#panel=max:/init) command in the PostHog AI chat. PostHog AI will ask you a few baseline questions to learn more about your product and company and then save it to memory. 

## Edit memory

You can also access PostHog AI's memory to make direct changes. You can access and edit its memory in three ways: 

1. Click the **gear icon** <span className="inline-block"><IconGear className="w-4 h-4" /></span> in the chat 
2. Navigate to project **Settings** > **AI**
3. Run the `/remember` command in the chat to add new information to memory

import { IconSparkles } from '@posthog/icons'

PostHog AI powers all AI features within the [PostHog app](https://app.posthog.com). It is an AI agent that sits on top of the PostHog platform. As a result, there are multiple ways of working with PostHog AI.

Here's an overview of the different UIs for interacting with PostHog AI.

## In-app chat

The primary dedicated interface is an in-app <a href="https://app.posthog.com/#panel=max">AI chat</a> for conventional prompting and conversation-based flows.

When logged in, the PostHog AI chat is always available in the right-hand sidebar of the PostHog app. You can open it at any time by clicking the PostHog AI icon.

The in-app chat supports conversation history and features like [context, commands, and memory](/docs/posthog-ai/context-and-commands).

## Platform UI

PostHog AI shows up throughout the PostHog platform as inline or ambient UI elements, typically labelled with the <span className="inline-block"><IconSparkles className="h-4 w-4" /> </span> icon, and embedded within other features.

These entrypoints or shortcuts enable you to trigger PostHog AI directly from the PostHog UI.

    autoPlay={true}
    background={false}

## Website chat

PostHog AI is also accessible when logged out of the app and on the website, [posthog.com](/). However, in this mode, it's limited to searching and answering questions about PostHog's documentation.

## Future interfaces

We are working on adding more form factors to expand PostHog AI's capabilities. These may include: 

- Notebooks for research and reports
- Background tasks and workflows
- API calls 
- MCP tool calls

- **Research answers** to product questions by querying the data.
- **Get things done** quickly in the PostHog UI for you like update filters, create insights, write SQL, find session replays, make surveys, and more.
- **Explain PostHog** features and how to use them based on our docs.
- **Chit-chat** about anything PostHog-related really.

## How do I access PostHog AI?

You can pop PostHog AI open wherever you are in PostHog! Just click on the [PostHog AI](https://app.posthog.com/#panel=max) icon in the corner of the app and get to chatting.

Because PostHog AI features use third-party LLM providers (see details below), the first use of PostHog AI in your organization requires org admin approval. In most cases this is just a formality, but we've made it explicit as we take data governance seriously.

## Does PostHog AI have any superpowers compared to ChatGPT and similar agents?

Glad you asked! PostHog AI is deeply connected with your data, and lives inside of the PostHog app.

Unlike other agents, PostHog AI can:
- Put on a data analyst hat and explore your PostHog data in depth.
- Create dashboards and generate PostHog data visualizations, such as insights.
- Interact natively with the PostHog UI, for example by editing filters.
- Generate complex [HogQL](/docs/sql) (our version of SQL) queries.
- Answer questions from PostHog's documentation.
- Create [surveys](/docs/surveys/creating-surveys) using natural language.
- Write [Hog](/docs/hog) functions to power your realtime destinations.


And soon, PostHog AI will be able to:
- Watch and summarize your session replays.
- Create [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) and [experiments](/docs/experiments).
- Conduct research.
- and more...

Check our [roadmap](/ai#roadmap) to see what's coming, and vote on our upcoming features.

## Add context to PostHog AI

You can help PostHog AI give better answers by adding context to your conversation. Click the **Add context** button to add:

- Insights from anywhere in your project, or from the current page you're viewing
- Dashboards with all their insights
- Events and actions from your data model

When you add context, PostHog AI can reference the specific queries, filters, and data from those items when answering your questions. Context automatically resets when you navigate to a different page, but persists as you move around the same page. You can also manually remove context items.

## What access does PostHog AI have to my data?

While working with PostHog AI, you will certainly share some information with it. Data analysis is a core feature. When doing research, PostHog AI can read the following data in your project:

- Events, persons, sessions, groups
- Actions and cohorts
- Event and property definitions
- Data warehouse schema

Based on that context, PostHog AI comes up with queries, runs them, and summarizes the results. Those results can be as high-level as a single number, or as detailed as a list of users with all their properties.

## Is my data shared with third parties?

We use third-party providers to power PostHog AI, so messages and all data accessed by PostHog AI (see list above) is passed through them.

Our list of data subprocessors includes:
- OpenAI and Anthropic – responsible for the core of PostHog AI's functionality, have access to user messages and all data types.
- Azure – responsible for semantic search across PostHog, has access to actions and cohorts (including their filters)

Other providers that are not data subprocessors:
- Perplexity – responsible for providing context about your product and/or company, has access to domain name (for websites) or application bundle ID (for mobile applications). We do not send any of your data.

## How can I get PostHog AI to remember information?

PostHog AI has a memory tied to your project and naturally tries to remember relevant information from your chats. You can also explicitly ask it to remember specific details using verbs like "remember" or "save", or most directly: the `/remember` command in the chat.

PostHog AI's full memory can be viewed and edited in project settings.

## How can I disable AI in PostHog?

If an org admin has previously approved AI features, but you'd prefer them disabled (and are an org admin too), you can disable PostHog AI and all AI data analysis in your organization settings. To do this:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **General**
2. Find the **PostHog AI data analysis** section ([direct link](http://app.posthog.com/settings/organization-details#organization-ai-consent))
3. Toggle the switch to "off"

When disabled, PostHog AI won't be available and no data will be shared with AI providers. This can be reversed at any time.

## Can I hide PostHog AI?

There currently isn't a toggle to _hide_ AI features altogether. However, in any case, only org admins can approve AI features in the organization – so there's no risk of data being sent to any AI provider without explicit consent.

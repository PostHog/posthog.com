title: Add and save memory to PostHog AI
---

## Run /init to start PostHog AI's memory

You can run the `/init` command to start PostHog AI's memory about your project and company. PostHog AI will use this memory to tailor its thinking and reasearch to your project's specific context.

## How can I get PostHog AI to remember information?

PostHog AI has a memory tied to your project and naturally tries to remember relevant information from your chats. You can also explicitly ask it to remember specific details using verbs like "remember" or "save", or most directly: the `/remember` command in the chat.

PostHog AI's full memory can be viewed and edited in project settings.

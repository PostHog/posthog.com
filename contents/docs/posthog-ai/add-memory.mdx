You can use PostHog AI memory to save context or information across multiple conversations. This helps PostHog AI to remember important details about your product, company, and preferred ways of working. 

PostHog AI uses this memory to tailor its thinking, research, and execution.

## Run /init command

To get started, we recommend running the `/init` command in the PostHog AI chat. PostHog AI will ask you a few baseline questions about your product and company and then save it to memory. 

## Edit memory

You can also access PostHog AI's memory to make direct edits. You can access its memory in two ways: 

1. Click the **gear icon** <span className="inline-block"><IconGear className="w-4 h-4" /></span> in the chat 
2. Navigate to project **Settings** > **AI**

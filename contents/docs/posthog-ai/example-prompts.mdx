PostHog AI can be used in many ways. Because it works directly with your project's data, its responses and actions are unique to your setup. There is no single "correct" way of using PostHog AI.

As a starting point, here are some example chat prompts you can use to explore what's possible with PostHog AI.

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="LLMs" type="fyi">
  PostHog AI's responses and findings highly depend on the product data, context, and prompts you provide it. As with all LLM-based systems, its non-deterministic nature means the same prompt can potentially produce different outputs.

# PostHog AI credits

PostHog uses **AI credits** to charge for all of its AI features.  
Each time you interact with an AI-powered feature — like asking PostHog to write SQL, summarize data, or analyze sessions — a small number of credits are used based on the complexity of your request.

This means you only pay for what you actually use.  
There’s no fixed subscription — and every organization has a free tier worth $25 (2,500 credits) so you can explore all PostHog’s AI features before paying anything.

### **When AI credits are used**

AI credits are consumed whenever PostHog performs intelligent work for you.  
You’ll spot these features by the ✨ icon or when using the in-app chat.

Examples include:
- Searching for session recordings in natural language  
- Summarizing experiment results  
- Writing or debugging SQL with AI  

### **What doesn’t use credits**

Getting help on how to use PostHog never costs credits.  
All AI features still in beta are also free to use — as of **Oct 31**, that includes **session summaries** and **deep research**.

### **How credit usage works**

AI credits are based on **token costs**, which reflect the effort required to complete your request.

- Simple queries (like “What were my daily active users in October?”) use very few tokens, and therefore very few credits.  
- More complex tasks (like analyzing hundreds of session recordings or rewriting a SQL query multiple times) use more tokens and cost a bit more.  

While exact usage varies, credit consumption usually scales with value — more advanced tasks cost more but deliver deeper insights and time savings.

You’ll always see **real-time cost information** while using AI features.

To keep it simple, token costs are converted into **AI credits**, billed at **$0.01 per credit** — so **1,000 credits = $10**.

| Example interaction | Estimated credit cost |
| --- | --- |
| “What are my daily active users in October?” | coming soon |
| “Show me session recordings for this organization_id” | coming soon |
| “Can you help me write a SQL query that…” | coming soon |

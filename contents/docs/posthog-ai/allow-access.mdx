## Allow PostHog AI access 

The first time you use PostHog AI, you'll need to grant access to your project. This action requires [admin permissions](/docs/settings/access-control) for your organization.

Because PostHog AI features use third-party LLM providers, we require organizations to explicilty opt in with admin approval. In most cases this is just a formality, but we've made it explicit as we take data governance seriously.

There are two ways of granting access to PostHog AI to your project as an organization admin.

### Option 1: PostHog AI chat

The very first time you enter a prompt in the chat, PostHog AI will ask you to grant it access to your project.

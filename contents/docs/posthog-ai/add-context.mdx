title: Add context and memory to PostHog AI
---

## Run /init to start PostHog AI's memory

You can run the `/init` command to start PostHog AI's memory about your project and company. PostHog AI will use this memory to tailor its thinking and reasearch to your project's specific context.

## How can I get PostHog AI to remember information?

PostHog AI has a memory tied to your project and naturally tries to remember relevant information from your chats. You can also explicitly ask it to remember specific details using verbs like "remember" or "save", or most directly: the `/remember` command in the chat.

PostHog AI's full memory can be viewed and edited in project settings.

## Add context to PostHog AI

You can help PostHog AI give better answers by adding context to your conversation. Click the **Add context** button to add:

- Insights from anywhere in your project, or from the current page you're viewing
- Dashboards with all their insights
- Events and actions from your data model

When you add context, PostHog AI can reference the specific queries, filters, and data from those items when answering your questions. Context automatically resets when you navigate to a different page, but persists as you move around the same page. You can also manually remove context items.

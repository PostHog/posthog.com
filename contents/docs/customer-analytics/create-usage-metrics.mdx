### Configuration options

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The column title shown in customer lists |
| **Interval** | Time period for the metric: 7, 30 or 90 days |
| **Format** | How the value should be formated: Numeric or currency  |
| **Match events** | Which events to count toward this metric |
| **Filters** | Additional conditions to narrow down matched events |

### Match events

Click **Add event matcher** to specify which events count toward this metric. You can add multiple event matchers, the metric will count events matching any of them.

For example, to track API usage, you might match events named `api_request` or `api_call`.

### Filters

Filters apply to all matched events. Use them to narrow down what counts—for example, only counting successful API calls by filtering for `status = 200`.

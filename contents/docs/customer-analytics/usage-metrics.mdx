Usage metrics let you define global activity measurements and track them for each customer. Any event performed by your users can be turned into usage metrics, so that you can understand their activity at a glance and identify expansion opportunities or churn risk

## Creating a usage metric

You can create usage metrics in two ways:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Customer Analytics** and click **Add usage metric**
2. Open any [customer profile](/docs/customer-analytics/customer-profiles) and click **Add usage metric**

### Configuration options

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The column title shown in customer lists |
| **Interval** | Time period for the metric: 7, 30 or 90 days |
| **Format** | How the value should be formated: Numeric or currency  |
| **Match events** | Which events to count toward this metric |
| **Filters** | Additional conditions to narrow down matched events |

### Match events

Click **Add event matcher** to specify which events count toward this metric. You can add multiple event matchers, the metric will count events matching any of them.

For example, to track API usage, you might match events named `api_request` or `api_call`.

### Filters

Filters apply to all matched events. Use them to narrow down what counts—for example, only counting successful API calls by filtering for `status = 200`.

## Example usage metrics

Here are some examples of usage metrics for SaaS products:

| Metric | Events to match | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API calls | `api_request` | Identify heavy API users for expansion |
| Feature adoption | `feature_x_used` | Track adoption of new features |
| Error rate | `$exception` | Spot customers hitting issues |
| Export usage | `export_created` | Find power users |

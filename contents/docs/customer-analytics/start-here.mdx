Customer Analytics helps you understand your users without building dashboards from scratch. It tracks active users, signups, conversions, and engagement—the metrics that matter when you're building toward product-market fit.

The [customer analytics dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/customer_analytics) works immediately with `$pageview` events. To extract its full potential, configure it with your events in [customer analytics configurations](https://app.posthog.com/project/2/customer_analytics/configuration).

Tips for nailing the setup:

- Use PostHog AI to help you find the events
- Create actions to group multiple events into a "single one"
- Be as specific as possible in event definitions. Sloppy definitions = sloppy metrics.

Usage metrics let you track custom activity for each interaction they have with your product. These appear on customer profiles and help you identify power users and churn risks.

Customer profiles consolidate everything about a customer in one place: their events, [errors](/docs/error-tracking), [LLM traces](/docs/ai-engineering/observability), and support tickets.

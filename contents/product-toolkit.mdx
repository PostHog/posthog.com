you can do powerful things across the platform, like:

-   ask questions about product usage or specific customers
-   auto-generate insights or run deep research
-   discover correlations in data that used to loads of time (and lots of SQL)

<div id="products">

<div id="pricing">

## pricing

our usage-based pricing means you don't have to "talk to sales". plus each product has a generous monthly free tier – in fact, 98% of customers use PostHog for free!

<div id="why-posthog">

## why PostHog?

we're different from most companies for a bunch of reasons:

-   **transparency.** read our [company handbook](/handbook), our [sales manual](/handbook/growth/sales/overview), or [company strategy](/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist)
-   **we ship fast.** see our [changelog](/changelog)
-   **actually-technical support.** our [support people](/support) all have engineering backgrounds.

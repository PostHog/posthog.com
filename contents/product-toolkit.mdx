<div id="why-posthog">

## why PostHog?

we're different from most companies for a bunch of reasons:

-   **transparency.** read our [company handbook](/handbook), our [sales manual](/sales-manual), or [company strategy](/strategy)
-   **we ship fast.** see our [changelog](/changelog)
-   **actually-technical support.** our [support people](/support) all have engineering backgrounds.

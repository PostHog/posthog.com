## About PostHog

PostHog aims to equip every developer to build successful products.

We do this by providing the tools teams need to capture events, analyze data, record user sessions, conduct experiments, deploy new features, track errors, run surveys, provision data warehouses, observe LLM-powered features, and more, all in one platform. And we're constantly shipping new things!

Founded in January 2020 by James Hawkins and Tim Glaser, PostHog was a member of Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch, and has subsequently raised $182M in funding from [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [GV](https://www.gv.com/), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), and notable angel investors including Jason Warner (CTO, GitHub), Solomon Hykes (Founder, Docker), and others.

You can read more about [PostHog's story](/handbook/story), [where we are going](/handbook/future), and more about our company culture in our [handbook](/handbook).

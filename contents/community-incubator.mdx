    <h2 className="text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-6">What we're asking from incubator organizers</h2>
    <p>
      Bring together a group of at least 6 people to co-work and build for 4 sessions. The goal is to give you the initial push but let you carry forward afterwards. If the group continues and grows, we're going to highlight it in our community. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a consistent time and structure that works for your group. For times, do evenings or weekends. For format, we suggest two ingredients: building and demo-ing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us know how it's going along the way.

      <p>
        One thing that's clear from the community incubators already in motion is that the organizer sets the tone. They come from different backgrounds (founders, engineering, product) but all have a clear vision for and desire to make an impact locally.

<details>
<summary>Who is eligible to lead?</summary>
<p>You are someone who really wants to get together with other builders. You are plugged into your local ecosystem and operate with a bias for action.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is eligible to attend?</summary>
<p>Individuals or small teams who are already or want to build products.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if more than one person applies from the same city?</summary>
<p>If it's a major city (population of 1 million or more), that's not a problem. If it's a smaller city, we'll connect you with other applicants from the same city.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens after 4 sessions?</summary>
<p>You've now bootstrapped a community, keep it going. If you didn't get the traction required to keep it going, let's learn about what happened and iterate for the next one.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What level of support do I get?</summary>
<p>We're looking for organizers who can drive this builder community with limited support from us. Venue? Participants? Promotion? This is up to you. Still, we'll be here to help along the way. We also have existing community organizers who can serve as inspiration.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's in it for us?</summary>
<p>We are excited about helping to bootstrap communities of builders around the world. That's what we're in it for. No one needs to use PostHog as part of this initiative.</p>

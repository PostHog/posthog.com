    <p>
      Bring together a group of at least 6 people to co-work and build for 4 straight weeks. The goal is to give you the initial push but let you carry forward afterwards. If the group continues and grows, we're going to highlight it in our community. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a consistent time and structure that works for your group. For times, do evenings or weekends. For format, we suggest two ingredients: building and demo-ing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us know how it's going along the way.

<details>
<summary>Who is eligible to lead?</summary>
<p>You are someone who really wants to get together with other builders. You are plugged into your local ecosystem and operate with a bias for action.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is eligible to attend?</summary>
<p>Individuals or small teams who want to build products.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if more than one person applies from the same city?</summary>
<p>For the pilot program we'll only select one based on your application and past experience. We'll connect you with other applicants from the same city.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens after 4 weeks?</summary>
<p>You've now bootstrapped a community, keep it going. If you didn't get the traction required to keep it going, we'll mourn then move on.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What level of support do I get?</summary>
<p>We're looking for organizers who can drive this builder community with limited support from us. Still, we'll be here to help along the way.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's in it for us?</summary>
<p>We are excited about helping to bootstrap communities of builders around the world. That's what we're in it for. No one needs to use PostHog as part of this.</p>

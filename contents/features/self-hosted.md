## Take control of your data

When you self-host, your data is all yours. This means your users’ data is not sent to any third-party, not even PostHog. The privacy of your users is preserved, and it is easier to comply with legislation such as GDPR and cookie laws.


## Deploy in your own way

We strive to make our deployment process as simple as possible. As a result, we offer a wide variety of ways to deploy PostHog, so you can pick the one that suits you best. Additionally, it’s up to you where you deploy it! This gives you more freedom and prevents PostHog from disrupting your tech stack.

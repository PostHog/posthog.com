Founded in 2017 and backed by [Index Ventures](https://www.indexventures.com/) and [CRV](https://www.crv.com/), Great Expectations creates software to help other teams ensure data quality and avoid reporting anomalies. As you’d expect, the team takes its own data seriously and decided in 2023 they needed the ability to gather data from across the entire user journey. 

“We have our marketing site, our docs website, and our product,” explains Marketing Project Manager Erica Howard. “We needed to look holistically across all three of these. Prior to PostHog, we hadn’t been able to follow these full user journeys or track data in a granular way.”

[Implementing PostHog across all three domains](/tutorials/cross-domain-tracking) also meant that this wasn’t just solving a need for the marketing team, either. Soon, every team in the company was using PostHog in some capacity to gather the data they needed. 

“Our growth team also uses PostHog, plus some of our software engineers,” says Erica. “Personally, I came in cold and didn’t know the product at all — but once I’d seen one insight setup it was fairly easy to replicate and go from there. There’s a whole lot more I _could_ do in PostHog, but getting started was pretty easy.”

### Analytics, annotations, and activation 

As soon as tracking was implemented across the three touchpoints, Great Expectations’ marketing and growth teams started creating reporting dashboards to track their most important metrics. 

“We look at things like the number of unique users and their referral sources,” says Erica. “We also track the number of pageviews per user, session durations, pages per session, etc. We use [user paths](/docs/product-analytics/paths) a lot to see how people move through the site. We have dashboards for most things, plus specialized views looking at particular marketing pages.”

Given her role working across multiple marketing projects at once, Erica finds [annotations](/docs/data/annotations) especially useful because they enable teams to add comments directly to the data. Typically these comments add extra context about why a metric is spiking, such as pointing to a marketing campaign which began at that point. 

“We’ve definitely made decisions off the back of these insights,” says Erica. “For example, we have [a page about integrations we provide](https://greatexpectations.io/integrations) and we were curious if we should move that info to the homepage. It was an open question for us about if it was a good idea, but when we tried it we could see it was pretty popular with users and so we kept it!”

### CRMs, Content marketing and collaboration

Tracking this data hasn’t just helped shape what content the team features on the homepage — it’s also shaped the broader content strategy and how the team works with writers. 

“When we look at our blog traffic we also map in specific blog pages,” explains Erica. “We’ve learned that some of our blogs have a lot of longevity and will continue to drive traffic over many months or years, whereas some of them don’t. Putting all these in a line graph helps us see what will take off and keep growing, versus what just has a launch bump.” 

“We want to keep users returning to our site, so tracking this very much informs our content strategy and helps us decide on content that actually works.”

In addition to helping the team make decisions about how to position the company, it’s also helped them to improve the quality of their data by integrating with their other platforms and making data more accessible to everyone. 

“We’ve got PostHog hooked up to Zapier for various things, as well as Hubspot,” says Erica. “That means we can match people from pageviews to their Hubspot records, and we can push data from Hubspot to PostHog.”

“It’s amazing, really. Before PostHog we had Google Analytics and Looker, which weren’t very user friendly. PostHog is a lot quicker and works well with Hubspot to that we now have a whole new level of data availability...even if you’re just using the entry-level layer of PostHog then it’s still so user-friendly and easy to analyze data with.”

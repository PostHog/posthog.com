[Croissant](https://www.getcroissant.com/) helps people find coworking and meeting spaces anywhere in the world. For their B2B growth team, understanding when someone’s ready to talk and reacting fast is key.

Until recently, they did this with a mix of in-house scripts and a tangle of integrations. That changed when they turned on PostHog [Workflows](/docs/workflows), which let them spot intent signals and follow up automatically, all within the same platform where they already tracked product analytics and web traffic. We talked to Jorge López, responsible for growth at Croissant, to get the details about how they use Workflows.

_“The main benefit is that everything’s already in PostHog. Syncing data across tools is always hit-or-miss, and expensive. Now it’s all in one place, and we can iterate way faster.”_

## Where the data starts doing things

Croissant’s team was already using PostHog for [analytics](/product-analytics), [web insights](/web-analytics), and [surveys](/surveys). But as they built out their B2B motion, they wanted a way to act on that data, not just analyze it.

They started by setting up a simple workflow: when a visitor shows interest for purchase, PostHog automatically sends a follow-up email to book a demo. If the user hasn’t registered yet, the workflow still stores an “intent” property so they can re-target later.

It’s a small automation, but it replaced several brittle custom scripts and runs continuously in production today.

_“We’ve already identified new customers through it. It’s early, but it’s promising, and it runs without needing us to think about it.”_

## Why they chose Workflows over other tools
Jorge has used almost every automation platform like Zapier and Windmill, but says Workflows feels different because it starts with the data they already have.

Instead of rebuilding schemas or syncing events from a warehouse, everything runs on shared product data inside PostHog. That means analytics, surveys, and outreach all live in one place, with fewer moving parts and fewer headaches. And when they need more flexibility, they can still call webhooks, update properties, or fan out to other tools for custom logic.

_“Even at this early stage, Workflows is better for us than Zapier. It’s simpler, and it lets us move faster without adding another vendor to manage.”_

## What’s next

Croissant is already planning to expand beyond onboarding and demos:

- Follow-ups for churn and renewals: tagging users 30 days before cancellation
- Reactivation pings for employees that travel frequently and may need space in a new city
- Cohort-based workflows that target users by behavior patterns

For Croissant, Workflows isn’t just another tool. It’s a way to keep their growth stack simple and their data clean. 

Instead of exporting, syncing, and re-mapping across five services, they can analyze and act in one place. That saves time, reduces breakage, and lets them focus on the creative part: finding new ways to reach the right people at the right moment.

_“PostHog feels like the nervous system for what we do: analytics, messaging, everything tied together. We don’t need to glue it all ourselves anymore.”_

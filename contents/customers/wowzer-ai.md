[Wowzer](https://wowzer.ai/) is an AI image generation tool. Their goal is to make it as easy and fast as possible for any person to create beautiful images.

As a B2C product with huge amounts of product data, Wowzer's product and growth teams are incredibly data-led. "Using [PostHog's analytics](/analytics), we're not just tracking data; we're uncovering actionable insights that drive our growth strategy forward," says Amin Tavana, SVP of growth at Wowzer. "It's foundational to how we iterate and build the best product for our users."

## Rapid experimentation and instant insights

Wowzer AI is continuously tweaking and [experimenting](/ab-testing) with features and pricing strategies on their platform. The ability to dive deep into real-time results drives quick decisions that significantly impact user conversion and engagement.

"For example, we weren't sure what effect moving our DALL-E model from free to paid would have. We ran an experiment and, after easily setting up a PostHog dashboard, we were able to see our conversion rate increased by 10%. Not only that, we saw that the average time to conversion decreased from two days to under four hours, and that the number of sessions per used increased," shares Amin.

These kind of detailed insights enable Wowzer to tailor their product to increase both engagement and revenue.

"Another example is when we introduced daily credit refreshes instead of monthly. All our key metrics improved and were able to understand that this was because users returned to the product more frequently. PostHog showed us not just the _what_, but the _why_ behind changes in our metrics."

## Driving growth with surveys

Wowzer leverages [surveys](/surveys) to [uncover their users' real problems](/newsletter/how-to-uncover-your-users-real-problems) and build what they need. Amin credits PostHog's intuitive UI for enabling non-technical users like himself to do this.

"It was as simple as clicking a few buttons. Within a few days of creating the survey, we saw that many users wanted a way to earn free credits. We used this informatiion to create our referral program, which now accounts for a significant portion of our growth."

"To summarize everything: if we weren't using PostHog, we wouldn't be able to uncover the amount of 'gems' we do!"

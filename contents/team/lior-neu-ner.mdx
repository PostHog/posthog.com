I grew up in South Africa and have spent time living in Israel, San Francisco, India, and Amsterdam 🇿🇦🇮🇱🇺🇸🇮🇳🇳🇱 and yet I've somehow managed to find myself stuck in London 🇬🇧

Before joining Posthog, I was at Meta for 5 years, working as a software engineer and engineering manager. I left Meta to explore a few startup ideas I had, like building a [Slack alternative](https://ifuckinghateslack.com/) and a few other ideas (which I wrote about in my [Substack](https://liorn.substack.com/)).
My current (side) project is [Remote Rocketship](https://www.remoterocketship.com/), which is a job board for remote jobs. Funnily enough, that's how I ended up finding PostHog:

I tweeted asking for a suggestion for an analytics tool and someone recommended PostHog. James liked the tweet, so I ended up looking at his profile and saw this job opening there!

On the personal side, I spend most of my time with my wife and son. In my spare time, I'm usually climbing, running, or walking about 🏃🏻‍♂️ I also try to go surfing whenever possible! 🏄🏻‍♂️

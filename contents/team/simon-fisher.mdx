After studying four years of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield in the UK I realised that I enjoyed presenting to humans and helping them solve their own problems with technology rather than hacking away at my (middling) code all day; thus a career in Customer Success was born. My main focus in this journey has been helping people automate lots of different things:
- IBM (7 years) - automate build and deployment
- CA Technologies (1.5 years) - automate build and deployment but with a different product
- Chef Software (5 years) - automate infrastructure and compliance
- Logz.io (1 year) - automate monitoring and observability

As you can tell, my passion is helping people automate all of the things so along the way I've picked up skills in DevOps, Cloud, and many adjacent areas. I also led technical teams at Chef and Logz.io so I'm passionate about developing high-performing groups of customer-obsessed people.
Notwithstanding my above comment about avoiding coding 9-5, I do like to keep my hands dirty with technology and I've been maintaining a website for people with Type 1 Diabetes (like myself) since 2008 which has helped me level up in Ruby, Javascript, Containers and lots more.

I live in Sheffield in the North of the UK with my wife, 3 young boys and a black labrador so have a very busy home life, mainly focused on taking the boys to various sporting clubs, long walks in the woods and Lego building.

When not working or family-ing I enjoy gaming on the Xbox, watching superhero films and home automation. My new year's resolution for 2022 is to watch all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in timeline order. My all-time favourite TV show is The Office: An American Workplace and 90% of the GIFs I use come from there.

When I was a kid the first thing I remember wanting to be was a pilot, so naturally here I am knee deep in code and data!

Growing up was slightly different in Florida. Things that are normal there are growing up in the water and spending almost all of your free time in it. In the Gulf of Mexico for me. We’d go swimming, scuba diving, or fishing in that warm body of water almost every weekend.

Nowadays I’m spending my free time on a bike finding some new trail up in the northern bits of the Bay Area that I call home now. If not on a bike you’ll find my friends and I on a hike either around here or over in Tahoe or some National Forest east of here. Lately I’m trying to get back into flying. I’ve got about 80 hours of flight in the book, but still don’t have my ticket! It’s time to change that. In the winter time you can find me ruining skis on some mountain.

In my professional life I’ve generally managed mopping up the 1’s and 0’s. I’ve led data at an [upstart music streaming company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grooveshark), and dove way too deep into the depths of the comment section leading data at [Disqus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus). Kept an eye on a fleet of [Autonomous Ubers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber#Self-driving_car_research). Most recently I combined my interest in bikes with data leading data engineering at [Jump](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_(transportation_company)>), still the best micromobility company out there.

When I’m not out and about in nature you can find me at home with my cat Tesla and Taco our goofball of a Lab Corgi mix.

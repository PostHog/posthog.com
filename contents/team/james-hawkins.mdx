I spent the first 10 years of my career trying to be a professional cyclist. I used to do web development part time to make some money on the side. I wasn't particularly good at either.

I live in Cambridge with Fran (wife), Ruby (daughter), and Wally (cat). Since you're probably wondering, the cat's name is a reference to [WALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E) - work for us to find out why.

After a growing sense of my own mortality combined with a bunch of large crashes put me off continuing with my cycling career, I bootstrapped an online marketing company to several million dollars a year.

I wanted more experience of working in a VC backed startup, so I could work on something really ambitious. I moved to [Arachnys](https://arachnys.com), and somehow wound up as a their VP of Sales for a little over 4 years, where I used to manage a team selling very large enterprise software deals. We learned how to take our sales from an average of $5K/year to over $1M/year.

I started working with Tim on a few ideas that didn't work out in August 2019. We built PostHog during the [Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com) W20 batch, and launched in February 2020. You can work out what I've been up to since by stalking me online.

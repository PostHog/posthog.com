Hi, my name is Thomas, I'm 35 years old and live in the beautiful city of Munich together with my girlfriend. I’ve been interested in programming and entrepreneurship since I was a small kid, originally wanting to become a game developer.

After school, I studied mathematics and physics with the desire to better understand how the world works - do we have a free will or is everything deterministic? [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!) surely left an impression on me. However it soon became clear that the answers I'd get wouldn’t fulfil my desire. 

I also always knew I didn’t want to pursue a traditional career (e.g. insurance) and towards the end of my bachelor I was looking to join a startup part-time. At a local event I quickly found out that technical people are in high demand. I met the founders of [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com), was immediately convinced, and joined them as CTO &ndash; full-time.

After a meteoric rise to 120 people and multi-million users, it was time for a new adventure and I co-founded [Workpath](https://www.workpath.com) with two people from the local startup scene.

Enterprise is fun for a while, but at some point I wanted to get back to building more consumer facing products. That’s when I decided to combine passion with job and founded [Passion Climb](https://www.passion-climb.com), which I now maintain as a side project. 

Looking for more peace of mind and not being the ultimate decision maker for a bit, I joined the fantastic team at PostHog, which I have already used myself at Passion Climb. And thus, here I am, focusing on building a great UI and making a product people love.

In my free time, I love climbing, being outdoors, vanlifing, cooking and great food in general.

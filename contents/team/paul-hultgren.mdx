Hey there! 👋 My name's Paul and I'm from the SF Bay Area.

I first became interested in coding when I was 12 and have been enamored with it ever since.
The first coding job I ever had was in high school building interactive textbook exercises for a large publisher.

Over the pandemic I was bitten by the 'start-up bug', and through my good friend I got involved with the [Blackstone LaunchPad](https://launchpad.syr.edu/) (A student-run incubator at Syracuse University), eventually becoming a mentor there.

This saw me spending the next year in Syracuse, NY helping students, while also working with a couple friends to create an online marketplace for student-run clothing brands⁠—which is ironic considering I have the worst-possible fashion sense.
Eventually, we inevitably decided to build the next big social-media platform, which didn't get too far but was an incredible learning experience.
After working on this for around a year, I decided to switch things up and ended up at PostHog!

Outside work you can often find me meandering on hikes through local trails.
I've also been doing origami for many years now, and I try to get some folding in at least every night.

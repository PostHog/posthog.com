I'm a scientist at heart who loves taking complex ideas and combining them into one simple product that users love - and that's why I'm a home cook.
Juuuust kidding. That's why I write code! I wrote my first line of "code" when I was 19 years old trying to change the color of an h1 on my WordPress website. I found the stylesheet, changed the hex code, sweated bullets as I pressed the save button, and then my jaw hit the floor when it worked. I continued to tinker with websites through my dual undergrad programs in Molecular Biology and Microbiology, and finally after graduating taught myself how to actually code.
In my career I've built websites for food bloggers, headed up Product at a manufacturing tech startup, built and ran my own startup (it failed), and finally found a role that allows me to do both PM and engineering as a growth engineer here at PostHog.
I live in San Luis Obispo, CA with my husband, AJ, our two little girls, Kacey and Norah, and our black lab pup, Dedas. In my spare time you'll either find me riding my mountain bike on the local trails or making tasty food in my kitchen (I do actually really like to cook).

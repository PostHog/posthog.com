Hi, I’m Ian. I’m a writer and software developer based in Vancouver. Unlike many at PostHog, I’ve lived nearly my entire life on the west coast of Canada.

My career started in sales and customer success as I thought it could lead to working on products as a “non-technical” person. I realized, if I learned to code, I could control my destiny and build products myself. So I did it, and that led to work at a few small startups and my own side projects.

At the same time, I wrote about areas that interested me like products, communities, and internet culture. Among other achievements, my writing made it to the top of HackerNews (twice). I’ve also written for startups working in crypto, devtools, and community. 

Outside of work, writing, and coding, I lift weights (working on my squat PR), play basketball, learn Spanish, and read a range of non-fiction books.

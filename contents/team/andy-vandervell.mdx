I spent 15 years in the media industry before joining PostHog, starting out as a lowly writer and working my way up the publishing food chain. Later in my career I moved into audience development, which is media code for “does SEO and stuff with data”. I now do content, SEO and stuff with data for PostHog.

I’m a big fan of sports most people find boring, like cricket, Formula 1 and snooker. I’m your standard issue geek – I love videogames and sci-fi, but I’m kind of done with superhero franchises. 

My main passion in my spare time is online sim racing – i.e. taking being a pretend racing driver way too seriously. Entering 12 hour endurance races, studying telemetry data and learning the intricacies of suspension geometry is my kind of fun.

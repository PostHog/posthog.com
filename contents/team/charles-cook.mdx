Born and raised in the UAE, I'm half British, half Lebanese, and grew up in various countries across the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Now based in the north of the UK, I live with my wife Steph and 1-year old son Remy.

I take care of all things ops at PostHog, across finance, people, legal and sales. I was previously COO at [Vitl](https://vitl.com), (personalised nutrition), and before that I held various roles including Director of Product at [ROLI](https://roli.com) (electronic music hardware and software).

I love terrible jokes, beautifully crafted sandwiches and looking at [designer houses](https://www.themodernhouse.com/) I will never live in. I like to occasionally torment my son with my piano playing and spend more time than is probably reasonable making lists of things, à la [High Fidelity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(film)>).

[See my README](/handbook/company/team/charles-cook) for tips on how to work with me.

Born and raised in the UAE, I'm half British, half Lebanese, and grew up in various countries across the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Now based in the UK, I live with my wife Steph and 2-year old son Remy.

I oversee all things ops & marketing at PostHog - unusual combo, I know. I focus most of my time as an individual contributor on figuring out how to grow our word of mouth, running marketing campaigns, financial planning, all things legal, and coming up with new ways to improve our culture. I also run BookHogs, our monthly book club.

I was previously COO at [Vitl](https://vitl.com), (personalised nutrition), and before that I held various roles including Director of Product at [ROLI](https://roli.com) (electronic music hardware and software).

I love terrible jokes, beautifully crafted sandwiches and looking at [designer houses](https://www.themodernhouse.com/) I will never live in. I like to occasionally torment my son with my piano playing and spend more time than is probably reasonable making lists of things, Ã  la [High Fidelity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(film)>).

[See my README](/handbook/company/team/charles-cook) for tips on how to work with me.

When I was seven, I liked to spend my free time assembling LEGO sets. What I enjoyed even more was building new things out of all the bricks I had from _disassembling_ sets. Then one day I deleted `shell32.dll` from the family Windows XP PC.

It was at that moment I realized computers are much closer to LEGO bricks than magic.

The fascination with computers progressed from that point. In high school, I became passionate about computer science and software for real. I built up a [portfolio](https://github.com/Twixes/) of open-source projects – some I still maintain, some one-off, and some I've yet to finish. At the end of school, I was not entirely convinced about spending four years at university. It seemed much more worthwhile and fun to learn by _building_ something interesting, so I thought: I might just as well apply to some tech startups and see what happens. This worked out with PostHog, which I've found via Hacker News's monthly "Who is Hiring?" thread!

I've acquired some other hobbies too. Juggling them is a challenge:

- astronomy (I was an astrophysics nerd before I realized software is cool too and _much_ easier to make a career out of)
- travel (goal: visiting all European capitals, currently at 23 out of 46)
- architecture (buildings and spaces are just as tricky to figure out as software user experiences, except much more permanent)
- design (my drawing skills are non-existent though)
- photography (take a look at my [Unsplash profile](https://unsplash.com/@matlokam))
- cinema and TV (A24 and HBO)
- music (some genres: electropop, post-classical, soundtracks)
- LEGO (still, just much more advanced)

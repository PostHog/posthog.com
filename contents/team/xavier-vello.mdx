Had I lived before computers, I would most probably have been a woodworker, building custom furniture to improve people's lives. Considering that I'm better at wielding a keyboard than a chisel, it is a good thing that I was born in the 21st century!

I graduated as a process engineer and worked in steel, cosmetics, and cement manufacturing plants before moving into software engineering. I still love to nerd out about manufacturing processes and industrial equipment, which probably explains why I find data engineering so interesting: it is mostly a series of digital tubes feeding digital machines.

I was fortunate enough to work with great engineers who mentored me into ramping up quickly, and it's important for me to pay it forward now. I am happy to share my knowledge and mentor people, and always looking out for public speaking opportunities. I am also the maintainer of the [letsblock.it](https://letsblock.it/) project, a tool to improve the Internet's low signal/noise ratio.

Born and raised in the South of France, I am partial to South European food and culture. My next vacation is most probably going to be either in Spain or in Greece, AGAIN. I currently live in Paris with my partner and our two feline overlords, Olympe and Marius.

I lived one year in Toronto, where I got way too much into musicals and started singing in choirs (currently on a hiatus until it's safe again). The topics I currently love to nerd out about are cooking, Star Trek, nail polish, legos, and amigurumi.

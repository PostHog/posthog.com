🇮🇹 Italian, from Rome, but living in Portugal 🇵🇹 and Namibia 🇳🇦 these days.

I spent the last 10 years doing these things, in more or less chronological order:

⛵ Traveled and lived in more than 70 countries, trying to get to a 100 soon, while living my best adventures, from getting stuck with no documents in China to road-tripping around Africa for half a year, I let life happen as I explore our big globe.

🚀 Studied and worked as a space engineer, doing cool space research stuff at MIT and working for Americans in Russia during unsuspected times, before realising outer space is not where I’m meant to be.

🎓 Always wanted to start a company, but didn’t know how to start a company, so I got an MBA to learn how run one? It was completely useless, but gave me the time to explore ideas for the future.

💻 Self-taught programming and machine learning, worked for a while in the chatbot and text automation space, bootstrapping several small to mid size startups and projects.

📚 Got myself into a “oh you should get all the degrees universities offer” mode, so now studying for a philosophy degree with a specialisation in islamic medieval philosophy. Next one is biology, I reckon.

🌎 Eventually landed on full stack engineering, consulting for two years for anything from SV startups to large adult entertainment companies, then running my own venture-backed startup in the note taking space for another two years…until life took a turn and I joined PostHog 🦔

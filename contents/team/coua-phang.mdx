I have lived coast to coast and am now temporarily in the south of the United States with family. I have spent the last fourteen years of my professional career in talent and people and absolutely love it! There’s just something satisfying about the hustle for great talent and learning about someone’s journey.

Outside of my career, I enjoy traveling, trying new restaurants, taking hikes with my three-year old cockapoo, Jasper and spending time with my insanely huge family (9 siblings and 17 nieces/nephews in counting)!

I am also a big foodie - I am always on the hunt for some good soup dumpling and ramen!

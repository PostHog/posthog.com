At PostHog, we sponsor a hedgehog for every new team member! Our donations support the work of the [Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust](https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/) in the UK, where the hedgehog population has sadly fallen by 50% over the last 20 years.

As HIR, Max oversees all hedgehog-related activity, including consuming an omnivorous diet, hibernating during the winter months, and being illegal to own as a pet in Italy and some US states. Max likes sleeping in dens and dislikes badgers.

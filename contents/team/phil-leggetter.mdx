I'm a software engineer who discovered developer relations through an instinctive desire to support and enable other developers. This motivation to empower others took me into servant leadership roles, collaboratively building developer relations teams that deliver value to both the business and external developer communities.

In 2016 I created the [AAARRRP DevRel Strategy Framework](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/aaarrrp/) that briefly made me semi-famous within the developer relations community.

My role at PostHog is to serve our customers and the broader developer community, enabling them to build successful products. I've spent most of my career working for API companies offering products used by developers to add new functionality to their web and mobile apps. I'm excited to now be part of a company with a mission to help developers measure the success of all the great features they build.

Hey! I'm Ellie, currently living in London and working on the infra team here at PostHog. I'm originally from the countryside, but moved to London for a CompSci degree I very promptly gave up on, in favour of a programming job 🙌

I've always loved making things, and have been writing code since I was 8. Here's a few of my projects:

- 🐢 a shell history sync + search tool [[atuin]](https://github.com/ellie/atuin)
- 🔊 a modified [iPod](https://ellie.wtf/ipod/)
- ⌨️ a [keyboard](https://ellie.wtf/my-planck-keyboard/)

Otherwise, my interests include motorcycles, photography, hiking, and just generally tinkering with things. This year I've ridden all over California, and did a 2000+ mile tour of Europe in a week! 🏍️

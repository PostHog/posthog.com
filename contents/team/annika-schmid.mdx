Believe it or not, my first job included writing exciting marketing campaigns for [robotic handling systems](https://www.schmalz.com/). (It wasn’t that exciting.) So I ended up moving to London in 2019 to study for an MSc in Human-Computer Interaction at UCL. (Way more exciting.) My plan was to land a job in a startup after graduating, which, through a bit of ‘hustling’ ([Sigma Squared Summit,](https://www.sigma-squared.org/summit/) [Voyagers,](https://voyagers.io/) [Kickstart London](https://www.kickstartglobal.com/)) and being in the right place at the right time actually worked out.

After graduating, I joined an early-stage startup called [Caura](https://caura.com/), where I first had the title of a Product Designer and later on, that of a Product Manager. Titles aside, what motivates me most in my work is talking to users about what they want, uncovering what they actually mean by that and then building something they didn’t even think they needed.

I joined PostHog in autumn 2022, arguably the most exciting step in my career so far.

What else? On weekends, I hang out with friends, try to make a dent in my ever growing reading list or learn something new. My family is from the Black Forest region in Germany, so I spend a couple of weeks every year working from there, going on lots of countryside walks and eating Black Forest gateau.

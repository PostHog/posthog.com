I am an 18-year-old Software Engineer from Germany. 

For the past two years I've been working on Tablane.net a task/project management tool, with features like Collaborative Editing, Optimistic updates and Live sync between all users of the same workspace.

Originally I thought about applying to college and spending another 3-5 years there, but after the positive feedback I got on a three month internship I did at ContentPepper, and seeing how my own projects developed, I decided to look for open Developer positions, to work with a team of experienced developers so I can learn even faster.

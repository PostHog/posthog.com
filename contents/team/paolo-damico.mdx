I started coding when I was about 9 years old, starting with the very basic LEGO RCX & Turbo Pascal language. I always enjoyed learning new languages, frameworks or technologies on my own, especially with a good book. Funnily enough, I decided not to study computer science.

Before joining PostHog, I lead a product team at Grow Mobility, the largest micro-mobility company in Latin America at the time. Before that, I co-founded Flinto, a Y Combinator startup targeting financial inclusion in developing economies. I enjoy reading while walking around strange places, and have tripped more than once.

You can find my goals in [My README](/handbook/company/team/paolo-damico).

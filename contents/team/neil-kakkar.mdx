There's three things I love:

1. Learning new things
2. Applying them
3. Doing something useful

Software happens to tick all those boxes, so there's no wonder I enjoy coding.

Before PostHog, I was at Bloomberg for ~2.5 years, before which I was studying Mathematics and Computing (ouch) at IIT Delhi. I've built a few fun projects, but one of my favourites is a crypto-currency I started in university that aimed to resolve the issues with Bitcoin. Even with a metric-tonne of funding, that didn't work out as expected, which clued me in to learn about non-technical skills and how startups work.

When I'm not coding, I [write my blog](https://neilkakkar.com), which also not surprisingly, ticks all the boxes above. I've had more than a few posts reach the top of HackerNews, which is epic.

When the above two exhaust me, I spend time travelling, bouldering, hiking, or dancing. Sometimes, I swim too, but the only stroke I know is the panic-stroke. Some other times, I spend time meeting interesting people [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/neilkakkar).

Fun Fact: I usually find out about "current" affairs ~2-6 months after they happen. Yes, I learned about Brexit after it happened... ...It happened, right?

I've always wanted to solve problems. So, I studied biochemistry. And discovered I am not a biochemist. During and after university, I played in several bands. Without changing the world of music. And fell into a job in I.T. support. For several years I managed I.T. for The British Mountaineering Council. I taught myself to program. Studied an MSc in Computer Science part-time. And discovered that writing software is how I love solving problems.

I'm half Italian. When I was young I refused to learn to speak Italian. Ma sto imparando ora! To make amends I've been learning to make Neapolitan style pizza and [getting pretty good](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apauldambra%20AND%20pizza%20time&src=typed_query&f=live).

There is a worrying link between the number of programming languages I've used and the number of children I've had. For a while, I was saying I had five children. Until someone pointed out I was counting the dog. My labrador retriever Yoko is - [as measured by photos taken](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apauldambra%20AND%20house%20wolf&src=typed_query&f=live) - my favourite child.

Since becoming a software engineer full-time. I've worked at software agencies. [At a startup](https://twitter.com/footclicksus), building Google Analytics for the physical world (which was like magic _when it worked_). And spent several fulfilling years leading teams at [Co-op Digital](https://twitter.com/coopdigital). I think in diagrams and draw on tables. And I am never happier than in the moments after I have managed to figure out how to make something simpler.

I've been keeping a [weekly work diary](https://pauldambra.dev/weeknotes) for most weeks since the start of 2020. It's been a great tool for practising being more reflective. And to help me remember you can work hard and still have fun.

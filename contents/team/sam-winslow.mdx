Hi! Iâ€™m Sam. I recently graduated from NYU, where I studied the interaction of media, technology & society. My earliest experiences with programming were building games on a TI-83 calculator and teaching myself BASIC at age 10. The first application I made was an MS Paint clone. I have worked in design, marketing, and software engineering since then.

In my free time, I love building hardware projects, reading about logic & philosophy, cycling around NYC, and taking care of my puppy, Louie.

One of the projects I'm most proud of was a social network for sharing music reviews. We had modest success among college students, and the biggest lesson I learned was that I wanted to spend more time coding new features and less time fighting the analytics tools in order to figure out what to build.

I am always at the beginning of my journey to learn.

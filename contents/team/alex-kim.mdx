Hi, I'm Alex. I have a degree in Biomedical Engineering because for the longest time, I thought I wanted to be a doctor. One summer, I wrote my first R app (blasphemous!) to crunch some genomic data, and I haven't looked back!

Since then, I've built a website for my parent's local business, co-founded a data product startup in college (LionBase), and helped build out a pub/sub broker (AWS IoT) that can handle hundreds of millions of messages every day.

As a New York native, I love pepperoni pizza but still enjoy the occasional pineapple slice. My other interests in no particular order, are: NYK basketball, The Strokes, hiking, competitive laundry folding, and recently bouldering.

As another Estonian I also first got exposed to coding in high school.
From there things escalated pretty fast and while my friends were eating ice-cream and enjoying the lovely sunny spring day outside I was in the computer lab programming a Snake game.

During my CS studies I did a quick detour and spent a summer selling books door-to-door in the US, which confirmed my suspicions that software engineering is a much better fit, but left me with an invaluable experience and thicker skin =)

I explored the fabulous life in Silicon Valley working at Facebook for 5 years and Twitter for 1. However I missed Europe and my love/obsession for dancing brought me back, this time to the land of croissants and cheese - Paris, France.
Outside of work and dancing I am currently on a quest to learn French, like to frequent the gym, and listen to non-fiction audiobooks.

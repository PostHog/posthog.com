Hi I’m Kendal and I live in Cambridge UK with my partner, Olly. I have a Law degree, but after seeing how much contract reading was involved, I decided it wasn’t the career path for me!

I enjoy reading, travelling, Formula 1, true crime and crochet. An eclectic mix, which will probably tell you a lot about me! Fun fact: I’m a Pisces, so I like to think I’m creative and intuitive, love to make everyone my friend, and enjoy having a little daydream.

I also have a cat called Meatloaf who exclusively wears bowties, so she is therefore far cooler than me.

Servus! 👋 By day I'm a Software Engineer jumping into every part of the stack I can get my hands on - by night I'm a <strike>legendary</strike> amateur musician <strike>touring the world</strike> writing silly songs in my lovely little corner of Munich, Germany.

I've had a fairly varied career from big places to startups to consulting to indie-app-development but always with Product at the heart of it - I love being part of making something that people get genuine delight from. More importantly I love bringing delight to the people around me whether that's with my home baking, terrible jokes or spontaneous songs (like the one I played to all my new colleagues in the first weeks at PostHog 🙉). I don't believe in being embarrassed - the best things happen when you open yourself up and share what your passionate about.

As an Englishman living in Bavaria, I speak English, German and "a bissel" Bavarian (please don't verify that with any Bavarian I know…). If you find yourself in Munich it might not be surprising to hear my terrible accent drifting across the Biergarten so follow the voice and come hang out 🙌

I hail originally from Niagara Falls, Canada (yes there is a city there!), and studied organic chemistry at the University of British Columbia with a view to enter the wine industry. Following a summer spent living and working at a winery estate along the German Mosel river, I decided that the industry was entirely too traditional for my tastes, leading me to pivot in search of something else.

Having been heavily involved in student politics at UBC (I served as President of Canada's largest student union), I nearly went to law school before fate brought me down to the Bay Area to build an AI-powered drone anti-collision software company as Head of Business Development & Operations. 

After a few years of fumbling around figuring out how start-ups work, I left Iris Automation to start my own company that failed spectacularly (turns out most folks don't want to give money to musicians during an unprecedented global pandemic), teaching me a number of important lessons about life and business.

My next stop was Gordian Software as Operations Lead, where I built the systems and processes that allowed us to facilitate the sale of airline ancillary services -- think seats and bags -- to millions of passengers around the world via online travel agency websites like Priceline. A few years later, I was ready for a new challenge, and stumbled upon the perfect role here at PostHog helping Charles and the team scale the business at a breakneck pace.

As for my personal life, I am a proudly out queer woman, and I do a lot of public speaking and advocacy work for queer rights, especially focused currently on the right for everyone to play sports as an avid athlete myself. 

In my spare time, I play rugby with the Berkeley All Blues women's rugby club as a flanker, rock climb both indoors and outdoors, ride my motorcycle (Triumph Thruxton 1200R) around the California highways, and am constantly listening to music or playing guitar and singing.

Finally, for the astrology nerds out there, I'm a Scorpio sun, Capricorn moon, and Aquarius rising, but I have so much Scorpio in my chart (5 houses), that it really defines me the most.

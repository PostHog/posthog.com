I am from the UK - so by default I love the pub, marmite and tea (but not all at once, that would be a sin).

I spent my youth trying to master fine art, after my teacher said I wasn't very good and that I should try something else.
In my stubbornness I decided to prove her wrong, and here I am - a designer.

After studying art through school, I took Graphic Design at university and graduated in summer 2020 with a first class degree. But instead of a summer of fun, I was faced with a crashing economy, a pandemic and a collapsing job market. But thankfully, after putting my portfolio up on twitter, I was contacted by PostHog a mere 24 hours later, and the rest is history.

I am now their Graphic Designer, and I couldn't be happier. I spend my days composing layouts for the website, designing the productâ€™s aesthetic, and most importantly drawing hedgehogs.

Oh and another thing, I live in the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) with my boyfriend G. We tend to move a lot and used to live in Senegal, but for the moment we are here.

Hey, I’m a software engineer from Rochester, New York - a cold and cloudy place. After moving around the US, I discovered that Southern California exists, and now, I live in Los Angeles spending as much time in the sun as I can.

I owe my love of software and computers to my dad. He’s a scientist. If you’ve ever seen “Honey I Shrunk the Kids”, he’s that dad. There was always a lab in the basement, and he was always excited to show me the latest tools, lasers, computer chips, etc that he was working with. I spent as much time as I could “helping him” and learning how things worked.

Since college, I’ve worked on a pretty wide range of products from developer tools and vehicle trackers to an immersive audio app and a German podcast app. I’ve flipped back and forth from being a product manager to a software engineer a few times, and even played the role of a local journalist and a (not very good) sleep therapist for a bit.

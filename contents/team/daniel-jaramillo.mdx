Hi there! My name is Daniel Esneider, and I am an SRE engineer with a strong desire to learn and improve. I am always looking for ways to contribute to my company and make a positive impact. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing soccer, and pursuing my passion for agriculture, specifically coffee beans. I have a solid foundation in both technical and practical skills, and I am always looking for ways to learn and grow in my field. When Iâ€™m not working on complex projects or tending to my farm, I love spending time with loved ones and approaching every task with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.

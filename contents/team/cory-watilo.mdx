(It's pronounced WADDLE-low.)

As one of the few PostHoggers who never attempted to enter the world of professional cycling, I instead spend much of my free time exploring new coffee shops or wine bars, generally sipping a cold brew iced coffee in the morning and a nice rosÃ© when it hits 5:00 somewhere.

I was once labeled "The migrating goose of PostHog" by CEO James Hawkins. Since I generally require both warmth and sunshine to function at any normal capacity, my wife and I bought an RV a couple years ago and hit the road fulltime, with our sole requirement being that wherever we travel _must_ have a [UV index](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk010aYaVBhFgzWm_AysLPp_ytPyFRg:1610376210393&q=What+is+the+best+UV+index+to+tan%3F&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMk-bvjpTuAhXBp1kKHXVtDIwQzmd6BAgTEAU&biw=1080&bih=946&dpr=2) of 6 or greater. (Fun fact: At 45 feet long, our RV is larger by square footage than many apartments in New York or San Francisco!)

Our party of 2 became a party of 3 last year. ðŸŽ‰ Now that I am officially a dad, I am now legally entitled to make dad jokes. So in light of the rich cycling history of our company, I present the following: "Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired."

(It's pronounced WADDLE-low.)

I'm the self-proclaimed webmaster of PostHog.com.

As one of the few PostHoggers who never attempted to enter the world of professional cycling, I instead spend much of my free time exploring new coffee shops or wine bars - generally sipping an iced almond milk latte in the morning and a nice sangria when it hits 5:00 somewhere. On Tuesdays, you can be sure to find me at a Taco Tuesday. (I live for Tuesdays.)

I was once labeled "The migrating goose of PostHog" by CEO James Hawkins, as I spent 3+ years traveling the United States [in an RV](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKgpGBYFUdm/). After a few years, I settled down in Tampa, Florida where I swapped the truck and RV for a [golf cart](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfmYzaZOlxL/), which is now my primary mode of transportation!

When I'm not wireframing in Balsamiq, designing in Figma, or writing Tailwind CSS, I'm likely building legos with my [two year old](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cltzakxp9jn/). Since I'm a dad, I am now legally entitled to make dad jokes. So in light of the rich cycling history of our company, I present the following: "Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired."

I first got into programming in 1994 when I wanted to make my own computer games... and asked my father for help. He sat me behind a Turbo Basic interpreter, wrote `PRINT "Marius on tubli poiss"` and then left me there. I was 8 years old.

Luckily we had a [Yamaha YIS-805/128R2](https://www.msx.org/wiki/Yamaha_YIS-805-128R2) lying around... with floppy disks full of random .BAS files. I was hooked. Cue to the beautiful loops of CLS, PRINT and GOTO statements that ensued. I even made some games where you could move two dinosaurs who got points when they kissed each other. It was glorious.

I also got into "web development" in 1997 after seeing Netscape at my mother's university. They even provided me with a generous 10MB of space to host my own [beautiful website](https://web.archive.org/web/19980128032518/http://rasi.lr.ttu.ee/~marius/), complete with animated gifs, a Mortal Kombat fanpage and a strong recommendation to use 800x600 with HiColor!

This was followed by years of writing games in C++ and then [writing tutorials](https://web.archive.org/web/20110626030555/http://cone3d.gamedev.net/) about them, coding websites in Perl, PHP, Java and Ruby... and "losing" a decade as the CTO of two failed startups.

On the side I built an [open source database analytics platform](https://github.com/mariusandra/insights)... and when that [got on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22347516), James reached out... and the rest is history.

These days I live in Belgium and code [state management libraries](https://keajs.org/) in JavaScript for fun.

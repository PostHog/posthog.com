I’ve had quite a varied career, starting with joining a “bedroom business” to build super-simple product that enabled local businesses to contact their customers. Then I hard pivoted to the Rail industry spending 5+ years in railway operations and management (think going to train crashes and pushing buttons to move trains around).

More recently I met James and Tim at a Financial crime startup (Arachnys), where we built products for banks and other businesses to reduce financial crime. For the last roughly 4 years I’ve been at Facebook working in the E-commerce space, connecting the world through social shopping experiences on Instagram and the family of apps.

I’m originally from the UK and currently live in North West London, I love to hike, mountain bike and ski in my spare time.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Guido. I define myself as a curious human, always eager to learn new things.
Professional wise, Iâ€™m an engineer with an academic background and experience in high volume/high availability Internet architectures. Iâ€™m a technology enthusiast excited about open source software. My passion is to develop, scale, and automate complex systems.
Here are few fun facts about me:

-   Iâ€™m originally from Italy but in the past Iâ€™ve lived in Ireland, Germany and New Zealand. I'm currently living Spain.
-   Iâ€™m a sailor, a former member of the national Italian sailing team and a certified sailing instructor. In 2018, I crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a 10 m / 34 ft sailboat.
-   I completed a solo hiking trip, starting in France and arriving at the end of Spain covering about 730 km / 450 miles in around 20 days.
-   I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895 m / 19,341 ft above sea level) via the Lemosho Route.
-   My working experience spans from little startups to multi-billion dollar companies.
-   I love challenges and throw myself into difficult situations.
-   Iâ€™m always interested in learning something new (in both tech and non-tech fields).

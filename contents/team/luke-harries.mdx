I'm the head of product at PostHog. Said more verbosely: I'm the head of product for a product that helps the best product teams build better products.

Before I decided to get ridiculously meta about product, I was the CEO and founder of a YC-backed HealthTech startup. I led everything product and engineering and learned a ton about the 0 -> 1.

I've been coding since I was 12, starting with Objective C and Visual Basic – I'd like to think my choice of languages has improved. I took a detour via medical school into tech, publishing some ML research on the way.

I live in North London with my girlfriend. Apart from building product, I thrive on type 2 fun – including winter dips in the Hampstead Heath Ponds.

If you have any feedback on PostHog fire it over to me at {firstname}@posthog.com

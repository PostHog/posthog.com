Hi, I'm Eltje (_pronounced Elt-ie_), originally from Northern Germany, I moved to the UK in 2017 and I am now based in East London.

Just like James, I used to be a professional cyclist until I realised you canâ€™t make a living as a female cyclist. After a short identity crisis, I started university with the goal to become a management consultant. That never happened, I luckily realised my skills and personality are much better suited in a people (I guess non-startup people call it HR) role.

At PostHog I look after our People and Talent function and my goal is make PostHog THE best company to work for. Previously I worked in very a similar role at a startup called [Farewill](https://farewill.com), who offer services around death (yes, you read right). Prior to that, I worked for a couple of companies later in their scaling journey, like [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/) and [Xing](https://xing.com).

Outside of work, I am working on my [Masterchef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterChef) skills and you can usually find me outdoors - either on my bike or during a long walk with a coffee in my hands.

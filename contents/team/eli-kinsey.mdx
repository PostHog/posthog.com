When I was 12, I was obsessed with trying to access MySpace from our school computers. At some point, after entering `ping myspace.com` 500 times, my teacher began wondering what I was doing, as did I. He yelled, "Hey, stop messing around in DOS!" I didn't tell him it wasn't DOS. Mostly because I had no idea it wasn't DOS.

When I'm not working, I enjoy creating and listening to music. I also enjoy cooking (haven't killed anyone yet), hiking Mt. Tam, and drinking a good beer. Sometimes at the same time.

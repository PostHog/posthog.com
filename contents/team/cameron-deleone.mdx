I've jumped around a lot, professionally. Once upon a time, I studied meditation and the brain by training drug users to meditate and then putting them in an MRI machine. It was a lot of fun, but ultimately, I realized the academic thing was not for me.  After that, I cut my teeth at a few software companies, where I worked with a ton of users, helping them build all manner of fun and interesting things to automate their businesses.

I found that I enjoyed making operations "just work" for businesses and developing relationships with customers quite a lot, so I spent the next couple of years consulting, doing just that. Eventually, I teamed up with a friend's agricultural business, where I built out an e-commerce store to sell poultry early in the pandemic, and built tools to improve operations. Ultimately, there are only so many technical problems to solve for a small poultry business, which is why I ended up at PostHog.

When I'm not PostHogging, I can be found cooking, hiking, collecting tinned fish, playing tennis, or pretending I'm 80 years old and contemplatively smoking a pipe.

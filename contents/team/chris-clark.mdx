Hey, y'all. My name is Chris. Some friends and colleagues refer to me as "clarkus". I'm originally from the Gulf Coast in Alabama, but now reside just outside of Portland, Oregon with my wife, two children, four goats, three cats, two pigs, innumerable chickens, and one really surly goose.

I built my first website in high school. I don't remember much about the website other than it had an animated gif of a tiger. Since that time I've been interested in semantics, browsers, systems-thinking, and how people interact with technology. In college, I couldn't decide between computer science and graphic design, so I did both. This lead me to product design, and specifically, designing and building for web browsers. I've been doing that professionally ever since.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new things. I'm currently learning more about archery, leather working, and wood carving (mostly spoons). I also enjoy camping, hiking, cooking, and generally being outdoors. I love animals and hope to one day own a donkey.

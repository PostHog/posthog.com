I spent my childhood in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere (Väätsa, Estonia), playing football, working in construction and driving tractors. I used it buy my own computer, but did not do much more than listen to music, play games and watch anime with it.

Things changed in highschool, where we had a programming class. I started creating my own games, participating in competitions (even going to International Olympiad once) and generally learning and reverse engineering anything I could get my hands on.

Some time has passed since then - I have since been a student, teacher, first engineer at a guitar learning startup, worked in fintech, helped scale a database cluster holding 1PB of data at an analytics company, learned and helped automate manufacturing of stickers, been a CTO in agritech startup and now learning how this open source business works.

In personal life, you can find me in the wilderness looking for geocaches or hiking, buying too many books and recently trying to figure out this parenting thing.

You can find more on how to work with me at [My README](/handbook/company/team/karl-aksel-puulmann).

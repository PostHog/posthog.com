Hi! My name is Kunal. I'm a Bay Area native and a bit of a startup vet.

I love helping teams discover new ways to apply data, product, and engineering to drive business outcomes. Most recently, I led the growth team at Amplitude and at an education technology startup prior to that.

When I'm not working on growth, you'll find me studying the Mamba Mentality, re-learning guitar chords, or making some ravioli (a lasagna if it's going poorly).

In terms of cycling– a friend once convinced me to go on a bike ride from San Francisco to Mill Valley. We took the ferry home.

HI! I'm Li from NYC. I fell in love with coding towards the end of college, jumped into a programming bootcamp right after, worked at a healthtech company for two years, and here I am today!

Some things I enjoy: karaoke, Switch/PC/board games, a good movie or series, struggling on hikes because I've spent too much time indoors, and exploring the NYC food scene.

A collection of Apache Airflow operators, hooks, and utilities designed to elevate dbt to a first-class citizen of Airflow. Run dbt commands directly within Airflow DAGs without requiring the dbt CLI. Features independent task execution in isolated directories, remote storage support for S3 and Git, XCom integration for artifacts, and uses Airflow connections as dbt targets.

A lightweight client-side validation library for ASP.NET MVC that eliminates jQuery dependencies. At just 10KB minified (vs 112KB for jQuery + validation libraries), it's a drop-in replacement for jquery.validate and jquery.validate.unobtrusive. Supports custom validators, async validation, MutationObserver for dynamic forms, and configurable CSS classes for framework compatibility.

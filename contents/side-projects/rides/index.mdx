A full-stack simulation of a ridesharing app consisting of five main components: simulation engine, database, web server, UI, and monitoring stack. The system simulates core ride-hailing operations including driver/customer spawning, route optimization, passenger matching, and real-time location tracking. Built with Node.js, Go, PostgreSQL, React, and monitored with Prometheus & Grafana.

Want to share your side project with the world? This guide will walk you through adding it to the PostHog Side Projects gallery.

## Quick Start

2. Add an `index.mdx` file with your project details
3. Open a PR to the posthog.com repo

## Frontmatter Schema

Your `index.mdx` file should start with this frontmatter:

```yaml

## Adding Images

Upload images to our Cloudinary account:

2. Name your files descriptively (e.g., `your-project-thumbnail.png`)
3. Use the full Cloudinary URL in your frontmatter

## Writing Content

After the frontmatter, write your project description in MDX. Include:

- **What it does**: Explain the project's purpose
- **How it works**: Brief technical overview
- **How it uses PostHog**: If applicable, explain the PostHog integration
- **Getting started**: How someone can try it themselves

### Example Content Structure

```markdown
## What is [Project Name]?

Brief description of what the project does and why you built it.

## How it works

Technical overview - what technologies/frameworks you used.

## PostHog Integration

If your project uses PostHog, explain how:
- What events are tracked?
- What features are used (LLM analytics, feature flags, etc.)?

## Try it yourself

Instructions for running locally or trying the live demo.
```

## Common Tags

Use existing tags when they fit:

- `llm-analytics` - Projects using PostHog LLM analytics
- `python` / `typescript` / `node` - Language/runtime
- `cli` - Command-line tools
- `web-app` - Web applications
- `demo` - PostHog feature demonstrations
- `data` - Data analysis/visualization projects
- `ai` - AI/ML projects

Feel free to add new tags if needed - they'll automatically appear as filter options.

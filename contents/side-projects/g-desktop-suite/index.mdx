A desktop application wrapper for Google Drive built with ElectronJS. If you've ever wished for a no-frills word-processing desktop app dedicated to just Google Drive, this is it. Provides a Microsoft Word-like experience for Google Drive users, allowing you to separate Drive from browser tabs. Features cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS) and automatic dark mode that adjusts to your OS settings.

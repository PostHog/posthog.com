PyPI Assistant streamlines Python dependency management directly in VS Code. Hover over any dependency to see package metadata including descriptions, authors, licenses, and release dates. Get inline CodeLens showing latest versions and smart version completion based on actual release history. Works with requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Poetry, and modern tools like uv and Pixi.

SeeGit is a Windows desktop application that visualizes Git repositories in real-time. Point it at any Git repository and watch as it displays your commit history, branches, and repository structure graphically. Changes update live as you execute Git commands, making it perfect for presentations, teaching Git concepts, or understanding complex repository structures.

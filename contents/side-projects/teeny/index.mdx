A super simple static site generator built for creating blogs quickly with minimal features. Generates pages based on HTML templates and Markdown content. Three core commands: init, build, and develop. Support for frontmatter in Markdown files to specify templates, static file management, and a local development server with file-watching. Purposefully minimal and strongly opinionated.

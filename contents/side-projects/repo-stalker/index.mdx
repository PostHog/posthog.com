Ever wanted to catch up on a repo without reading 47 PR comments? Repo Stalker lets you chat with AI about any GitHub repository's PRs and issues. Ask "what happened this week?" and actually get an answer. Search repos, save favorites, get AI summaries, and have natural conversations about code changes. Built with React, TypeScript, and edge functions that support Gemini and GPT models.

An AI-powered GitHub repository assistant that helps developers catch up on project activity through natural conversations about pull requests and issues.

## What it does

- **Repository Search**: Find and save favorite GitHub repositories
- **AI Chat with PRs**: Natural conversations about pull requests to understand changes quickly
- **AI Chat with Issues**: Discuss issues and get context without reading full threads
- **Smart Summaries**: AI-generated summaries of PRs and issues
- **Trending Repos**: Discover popular GitHub repositories
- **Save Favorites**: Bookmark repositories for quick access

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Lovable Cloud edge functions with serverless architecture
- **Edge Functions**:
  - `chat-with-repo`: Repository-level AI conversations
  - `chat-with-pr`: PR-specific analysis
  - `summarize-items`: Generate PR/issue summaries
  - `fetch-trending-repos`: GitHub trending data
- **AI Models**: Support for Google Gemini 2.5 (Pro/Flash/Flash-Lite) and OpenAI GPT-5

## How it uses PostHog LLM Analytics

Repo Stalker demonstrates a custom PostHog implementation with distinct span tracking:

- **Custom PostHog Utility**: Dedicated HTTP-based capture function in edge functions
- **Span Naming Strategy**: Distinct span names for different interaction types:
  - `repo_chat`: Repository-level conversations
  - `pr_chat`: PR-specific discussions
  - `issue_chat`: Issue analysis
  - `repo_pr_summary`: PR summaries
  - `repo_issue_summary`: Issue summaries
- **Session Tracking**: All interactions grouped by session ID for conversation analysis

### Event capture pattern

```typescript
await capturePostHogEvent({
  event: '$ai_span',
  properties: {
    $ai_span_name: 'pr_chat',
    $ai_session_id: sessionId,
    // ... additional context
  }
})
```

## Try it yourself

Clone the repo and deploy via Lovable Cloud, or self-host on Vercel/Netlify:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

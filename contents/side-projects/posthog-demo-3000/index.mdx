A fully-featured Flask demo application styled as a movie streaming platform (HogFlix) instrumented with PostHog analytics. Showcases PostHog's capabilities including event tracking, feature flags, cohorts, and LLM analytics.

## What it does

- **Movie Streaming UI**: Browse movies, manage subscriptions, search content
- **User Authentication**: Flask-Login with secure password hashing
- **Subscription System**: Plan selection with revenue tracking
- **Blog System**: Full blog creation/deletion with admin controls
- **Feature Flags**: Accessible via `/feature-flags` route with full UI
- **AI Chat**: Optional LLM chat interface for demonstrating LLM analytics

## Pre-seeded Demo Data

The app comes with everything you need for demos:

- **500 Fake Users**: Pre-generated with realistic names and emails
- **30+ Days of Historical Events**: Pseudo-random activity data
- **PostHog Artifacts**: Automatically created actions, cohorts, insights, and feature flags
- **Seeding Scripts**: Regenerate data anytime with included utilities

## How it uses PostHog LLM Analytics

HogFlix demonstrates dual LLM integration approaches:

**LangChain Path** (preferred):
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from posthog.ai.langchain import CallbackHandler

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
handler = CallbackHandler(posthog_client)
response = llm.invoke(messages, config={"callbacks": [handler]})
```

**Direct OpenAI Path** (fallback):
```python
from posthog.ai.openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(posthog_client=posthog_client)
```

**Events captured**:
```python
event='$ai_generation'
properties={
    '$ai_model': 'gpt-4o-mini',
    '$ai_provider': 'openai',
    '$ai_input': user_message,
    '$ai_output': ai_response,
    '$ai_trace_id': conversation_id
}
```

## Other PostHog Features Demonstrated

- `user_signed_up`: Plan selection tracking
- `subscription_purchased`: Revenue tracking (plan, price, currency, months)
- `search_performed`: Search query tracking
- Feature flag evaluation and UI
- Session management with conversation IDs

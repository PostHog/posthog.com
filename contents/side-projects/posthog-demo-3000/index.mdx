A fake movie streaming site pre-loaded with 500 users and 30 days of event data. Perfect for demos, testing PostHog features, or pretending you have a Netflix competitor while learning analytics. It's got everything – user auth, subscriptions, feature flags, an AI chat, and seeding scripts to regenerate the fake data whenever you want. Built in Flask, fully instrumented with PostHog, ready to spin up in Docker or Codespaces.

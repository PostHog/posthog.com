Forget copy-pasting from GitHub every morning. This CLI uses AI agents to scrape your PRs, commits, and reviews, then generates a standup summary you can actually paste into Slack without shame. Built on the OpenAI Agents SDK with a multi-agent workflow – one agent gathers the data, another summarizes it, and you can chat to refine the output until it doesn't make you sound like you did nothing all week.

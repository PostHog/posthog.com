An anomaly detection system that doesn't require a PhD. Point it at your metrics from BigQuery, Snowflake, ClickHouse, whatever – it'll use ML to spot the weird stuff and LLMs to explain why it's weird. Dagster handles the orchestration (ingest, train, score, alert), and there's a dashboard with sparklines and feedback buttons so you can tell it when it's wrong. Comes with 26 example metrics out of the box if you just want to poke around.

A performance-first React map engine designed as a lightweight alternative to Google Maps and Leaflet. Pigeon Maps offers minimal bundle size, touch and mouse event support, tile rendering, markers, overlays, zoom controls, and smooth animations - all without external dependencies. The whimsical name references pigeons' biological magnetoreception abilities and their historical connection to mapmaking.

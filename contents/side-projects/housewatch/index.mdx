The ClickHouse monitoring toolkit PostHog built for ourselves and then open-sourced. Query performance analysis, schema visualization, natural language queries, real-time monitoring – basically everything you wish you had when debugging slow queries at 2am. Born at the 2023 Aruba hackathon, battle-tested on clusters processing millions of events daily.

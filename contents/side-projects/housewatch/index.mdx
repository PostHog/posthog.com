An open-source suite of tools for monitoring and managing ClickHouse clusters. Built by PostHog engineers who've been running ClickHouse at scale since 2021, HouseWatch consolidates debugging and operational capabilities into a single interface.

## What it does

- **Query Performance Analysis**: Identifies slow queries with normalized views, detailed statistics, and EXPLAIN plan analysis
- **Schema Management**: Database schema visualization with drill-down capabilities and disk usage metrics per node
- **Query Benchmarking**: Performance testing and comparative analysis between queries
- **Cluster Operations**: Real-time query monitoring, query termination, and background operations with automatic rollback
- **Natural Language Queries**: GPT-powered query generation from plain English descriptions
- **Logs & Errors**: Searchable log access and error tracking

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (55% of codebase)
- **Backend**: Django + Python (42% of codebase)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for easy self-hosting

## Origin Story

HouseWatch was born at PostHog's 2023 Aruba hackathon. Engineers Li Yi Yu, Yakko Majuri, and CTO Tim Glaser built the first version to formalize the tools and expertise PostHog had developed managing ClickHouse clusters processing millions of events daily.

## Try it yourself

# Create .env with your ClickHouse credentials
cat > .env << EOF
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=localhost
CLICKHOUSE_CLUSTER=mycluster
CLICKHOUSE_USER=default
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=your-password
EOF

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Open http://localhost:8000 to access the dashboard.

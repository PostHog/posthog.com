Configure your preferred LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio), choose your model, and customize prompts. Includes seven preset options: grammar correction, professional tone, simplification, summarization, expansion, and bullet-point conversion - plus unlimited custom prompts.

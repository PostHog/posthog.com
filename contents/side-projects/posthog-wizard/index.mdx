An AI-powered CLI tool that automates PostHog integration into your projects. The Wizard acts as an "envoy" - conventional software that meets AI agents within coding sessions to ensure correct, hallucination-free integrations.

## What it does

- **Automated Integration**: Adds PostHog to React, Next.js, Svelte, Astro, and React Native projects
- **API Key Management**: Fetches keys from your PostHog account and populates `.env` files securely
- **LLM-Powered Code Generation**: Uses consistent prompting to read your code and integrate PostHog correctly
- **Agent-Ready**: Non-interactive mode for AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Bolt, etc.)
- **MCP Server Management**: Install/remove PostHog MCP servers for supported clients

## Why it exists

AI agents often hallucinate PostHog API keys or use outdated integration patterns. The Wizard solves this by:

1. Authenticating with your real PostHog account
2. Using up-to-date integration code, not training data
3. Enforcing best practices through deterministic prompts

## Using with AI Agents

Paste this into Cursor, Claude Code, or other agent chats:

```
Integrate PostHog into this project using the PostHog wizard CLI.
Run: npx @anthropic/wizard
Follow the prompts to authenticate and configure.
```

The agent runs the command, and you get a working integration in ~90 seconds.

## Try it yourself

```bash
# Interactive mode
npx @posthog/wizard

# Non-interactive mode (for CI/CD or agents)
npx @posthog/wizard --api-key YOUR_KEY --non-interactive
```

The Wizard is MIT licensed - [fork it](https://github.com/PostHog/wizard) to build your own envoy for your developer tools.

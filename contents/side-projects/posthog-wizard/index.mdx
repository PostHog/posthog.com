An AI-powered CLI that integrates PostHog into your project without hallucinating API keys or using outdated patterns. Tell Cursor or Claude Code to run it, and you'll have working analytics in 90 seconds. Works with React, Next.js, Svelte, Astro, and React Native – authenticates with your real PostHog account, uses up-to-date integration code, and has a non-interactive mode for CI/CD pipelines.

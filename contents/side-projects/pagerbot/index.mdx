A bot for IRC and Slack that simplifies PagerDuty on-call schedule management through natural language commands. Query schedules, override shifts, trigger incidents, and manage on-call assignments using conversational commands like "who is on primary now?" and "put me on triage for 30 minutes." Easily deployable to Heroku with one-click setup.

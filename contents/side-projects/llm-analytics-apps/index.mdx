A CLI playground for testing PostHog's LLM analytics across every AI provider you can think of. Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain, LiteLLM, Vercel AI, and more – pick a provider, run a test, see your traces light up in PostHog. Available in Python and Node.js flavors, with test modes for chat, tool calls, image descriptions, embeddings, and transcriptions. Useful for kicking the tires on LLM observability before wiring it into your actual product.

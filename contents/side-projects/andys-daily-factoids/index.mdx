A full-stack application that generates creative AI factoids every 30 minutes. Features interactive voting, real-time streaming, model flexibility, and Stripe payments integration.

## What it does

- **Fresh Factoids**: Auto-generated via scheduled cron job (every 30 minutes) or on-demand
- **Interactive Voting**: Users vote with mind-blown or boring reactions with live tallies
- **Browse & Shuffle**: Explore the full catalogue without waiting for generation
- **Model Flexibility**: Override generation parameters and select different models via OpenRouter
- **Metadata Inspection**: View model details, parameters, and cost per factoid
- **Payments**: Stripe integration to unlock additional generations
- **Chat Agent**: Conversational interface with web search tool for discussing factoids

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Django 5 + Django REST Framework on Gunicorn with PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming
- **Infrastructure**: Deployed on Render with separate services for backend, frontend, and cron automation

## How it uses PostHog LLM Analytics

The app demonstrates production-grade multi-platform observability:

- **Backend Setup**: PostHog client with synchronized event flushing and exception autocapture
- **Generation Tracking**: LangChain callback handler captures model selection, token usage, cost, and latency
- **Client-Side Analytics**: Next.js frontend with PostHog integration for user behavior
- **Custom Events**: `$ai_generation` events with full metadata (model, cost, parameters)
- **Multi-Platform**: Also integrated with Braintrust, LangSmith, and Langfuse for comprehensive observability

### Key patterns demonstrated

- Service layer design separating API, business logic, and persistence
- Rate limiting with Redis (production) and in-memory fallback
- Per-profile daily budget enforcement with cost tracking
- Real-time SSE streaming of generation progress

A full-stack app that generates AI factoids every 30 minutes. Vote if your mind was blown or bored, browse the back catalogue, or interrogate the chat agent about whether hedgehogs really can swim. Built with Django and Next.js, it's got real-time streaming, Stripe payments for power users who need more factoids, and the kind of multi-platform LLM observability setup you'd want in production.

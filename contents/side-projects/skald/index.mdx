An open-source, production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) platform. Skald provides a plug-and-play API that handles document ingestion, vector storage, semantic search, and LLM-powered chat. Chat with your knowledge in one API call, with configurable reranking, query rewriting, and built-in evaluation tools. Multi-language SDK support for Python, Node, Go, PHP, C#, and Ruby.

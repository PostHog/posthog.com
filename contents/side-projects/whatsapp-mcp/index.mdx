WhatsApp MCP integrates WhatsApp with Claude through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI-powered interactions with your personal WhatsApp account. Search and read your WhatsApp messages, manage contacts, and send text or media files directly through Claude. All messages are stored locally in a SQLite database with full user control over what gets sent to the LLM.

An operating system for single-function smart frames designed for Raspberry Pi deployment. Supports e-ink and traditional displays, from slow-refresh (60 seconds per frame) to high-refresh (60 fps) screens. Perfect for smart home calendars, meeting room displays, thermostats, industrial dashboards, and public advertisement screens. Features a dockerized Python backend for deploying applications to frames via SSH.

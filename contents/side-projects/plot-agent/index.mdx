Describe the chart you want in plain English, get Plotly code. Uses LangGraph for reliable generation and sandboxed execution so your "create a bar chart" request doesn't accidentally rm -rf anything. AST validation, import allowlists, 60-second timeouts – the paranoid security setup you'd want when letting an LLM write code that actually runs. Chat back and forth to refine until the visualization looks right.

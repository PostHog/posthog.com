A DNS server where every IP address gets its own domain. Automatically resolves encoded IP addresses to their actual values across IPv4 and IPv6 formats. Use dots (142.250.147.138.backname.io) or dashes (127-0-0-1.backname.io) as separators. Available as a free public service or self-hostable via Docker Compose with high availability configuration.

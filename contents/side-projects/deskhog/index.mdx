A palm-sized, open-source developer toy built around an ESP32-S3 microcontroller. DeskHog packages an Adafruit board with custom firmware, a 3D-printed case, and a color display into something you can actually build projects with.

## What it does

- **Built-in WiFi**: Easy network setup through a web portal
- **Card-based UI**: Paginated screen interface with button navigation
- **Rich Graphics**: LVGL-powered display with 240x135 color screen
- **~10hr Battery**: Built-in battery management for portability
- **Stable Foundation**: Dual-core task management prevents crashes from your experimental code

## Built for AI-assisted development

DeskHog's firmware is specifically designed for agent-based LLM coding:

- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized folders for network code, UI code, clients, and parsers
- **Heavily Commented**: Class interfaces documented for AI agent context
- **Tested by Non-Engineers**: PostHog team members with no hardware experience built games and tools in 48 hours using Claude and Cursor

## Example Projects

The repo includes projects built by PostHog team members:
- Pong and Flappy Bird games
- Roguelike adventures
- Pomodoro timer
- Data visualization dashboards

## Try it yourself

Get a kit from the [DeskHog page](/deskhog) or source your own [Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PostHog/DeskHog
cd DeskHog
# Follow the setup guide in the repo for PlatformIO
```

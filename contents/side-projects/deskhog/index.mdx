A palm-sized ESP32 toy built for AI-assisted tinkering. The firmware is heavily commented so Claude can actually help you build games and dashboards on it – non-engineers at PostHog shipped working Pong clones and roguelikes in 48 hours. WiFi, color display, 10-hour battery, and a codebase organized well enough that LLMs don't hallucinate their way into bricking it.

A self-hostable product analytics platform. Automate the collection of every event on your website or app, with no need to send data to third parties. Send push notifications to your phone or desktop using simple HTTP requests. An open-source alternative to LogSnag, built with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

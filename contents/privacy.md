## Introduction

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all visitors and users of the PostHog.com hosted services and websites (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”) and self-managed installations, which are offered by PostHog Inc (formerly Hiberly Inc) and/or any of its affiliates (“PostHog” or “we” or “us”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using any part of the Websites or self-managed installations, you acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.

PostHog is an open source project and collaborative community, as well as a company. This means that many portions of our Websites, including information you voluntarily provide, will be public-facing for the open sharing of innovative developments, ideas, and information that makes our collaborative community so great. While we are committed to open sharing, we strive to respect the privacy of individual community members and will minimize the information we collect and share. If you do not want to share your information, including personally identifiable information, with other community members and the public, please be thoughtful as to how you interact with our Websites and what information you provide through the Websites (for example, through creating a public profile, project contributions, comments, and blog posts).

### Data protection

Oversight of Data Security is handled by PostHog's respective Data Protection Officers. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by PostHog, or if you have any general security concerns, please contact us at [privacy@posthog.com](mailto:privacy@posthog.com).

## What Information PostHog collects and why

### Information from website visitors

Like most website operators, PostHog collects basic non-personally-identifying information from Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this information to better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the Websites. From time to time, PostHog may publicly release non-personally-identifying information collected from Website visitors in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.

PostHog also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from visitors. PostHog does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve performance and content, and to monitor the security of the Websites. For logged-in users to PostHog deployments, PostHog tracks potentially personally-identifiable user behavior on our application using our own software, to help us understand how to make the website more useful for different categories of user.

PostHog may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites. For instance, PostHog may reveal how many downloads a particular version got using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous user information only.

### Usage data information from self-managed PostHog instances

PostHog collects information about usage from each self-managed PostHog instance (Community Edition and Enterprise Edition). It is possible to opt out of personally identifiable information being transferred, and for self-managed PostHog instances, we do not track your end users' at all. PostHog tracks the usage of these instances at an aggregate level - it is also possible to prevent this through modifiying the code, which is made available to you.

### Personally-identifying information

Users of the Websites may choose to interact with PostHog in ways that provide us with their personally-identifying information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and url tracking, page views, page pings and usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type of information that PostHog gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example, we ask visitors who use our community slack group to provide a username and email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in connection with creating an account on the Website. Profile information is shared publicly, as well as activity under your profile. If you report a security vulnerability to PostHog and request public acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgement. In each case, PostHog collects such personally-identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of PostHog. We will not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related activities or being able to access and use certain features and services.

For details about what information is collected and with whom it is shared, please go to Tech stack applications.

## Information PostHog does not collect

PostHog does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although PostHog does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of information in a PostHog instance by pushing it to us through our libraries or API. If you store any sensitive personal information on PostHog’s servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the United States.

If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the Website. PostHog does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our Website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s account.

Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use PostHog.

## Basis for processing your information

Performance of a contract. The use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our Websites to purchase PostHog product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project, create a profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request information through our Websites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or request.

Legitimate interests. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best content through our Websites and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.

Consent. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about PostHog products. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by contacting us at the addresses given at the end of this Privacy Policy.

## How PostHog uses and protects personally-identifying information

### Sharing your information

PostHog only discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PostHog's behalf or to provide services available on the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Please note, email and IP addresses of users of a PostHog deployment may be shared with the respective users of that deployment.

PostHog will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, PostHog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when PostHog believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PostHog, third parties, or the public at large.

PostHog takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

PostHog at its sole discretion may make use of company logos where those companies are using the software that we provide. If you have concerns over the use of your logo, please email logos@posthog.com.

### International transfer of information

The Website is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information for us as described above may be located in the United States or in other countries outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the international transfer of your information by PostHog.

### PostHog communications with you

If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your email address, PostHog may occasionally send you an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with PostHog and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you so you can stop receiving such emails at any time.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We will not publish your personally-identifiable information in connection with your request.

## Cookies, tracking technologies and Do Not Track

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. PostHog uses cookies to help PostHog identify and track visitors, their usage of the Websites, and their Website access preferences. PostHog visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Websites. Disabling browser cookies may cause certain features of PostHog's websites to not function properly.

Certain pages on the Website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy.

### Tracking technologies

We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or collect your personally identifiable-information. We may use these services to collect information about how the Website performs and how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our content and Website performance.

Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use of the Website. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.

### Do Not Track

"Do Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. PostHog does not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.

## Global privacy practices

Information we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy but we understand that users from other countries may have different expectations and rights with regard to their privacy. For all Website visitors and users, no matter their country of location, we will:

* provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your personal information;
* only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the purpose it is collected for, unless you choose to provide us more;
* offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your information that we have collected, with the exception of information you voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as is for the integrity of our project code as described further below; and
* provide Website users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.

If you are located in the European Union, you are entitled to the following rights with regard to your personal information and data:

* Right of access to your personal data, to know what information about you we hold
* Right to correct any incorrect or incomplete personal data about yourself that we hold
* Right to restrict/suspend our processing of your personal data
* Right to complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy rights are being violated

Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:

* Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent and automated means)
* Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent)
* Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests)
* Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes
* Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be forgotten”) if certain grounds are met

To exercise your privacy rights, you can email us at the address given below in the ‘Contacting PostHog About Your Privacy’ section of this Privacy Policy.

## Data retention and deletion

If you already have an account on the Websites, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.

PostHog will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the Website, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.

Please note that due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited personally-identifiable information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and nonrepudiation. For example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post, GitHub issue or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, as described in our Terms of Use, if you contribute to a PostHog project and provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, that information (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.

## Sub-processors

A sub-processor is any business who has or potentially will have access to or process your data. We use a minimal number of sub-processors outlined below, together with the reasons why. This list may be updated from time to time, and all privacy policies of these sub-processors are reviewed by our Data Protection Officer before we engage with them.

## Job applications

This section sets out how we collect, store, and process personal information as part of our recruitment process. It only applies to users of our website who submit an application for one of our open roles. 

We use [Workable](https://workable.com/), an online application provided by Workable Software Limited, to assist with our recruitment process. We use Workable to process personal information as a data processor on our behalf. Workable is only entitled to process your personal data in accordance with our instructions.

Where you apply for a job opening posted by us, these provisions will apply to our processing of your personal information. When you apply for a job opening via the application function on a job site like LinkedIn or similar online service provider (referred to below as a “Partner”), you should note that the relevant Partner may retain your personal data and may also collect data from us in respect of the progress of your application. Any use by the Partner of your data will be in accordance with the Partner’s privacy policy.

### Information we collect from applicants

#### Information we collect from you

We collect and process some or all of the following types of information from you:

* Information you provide when you apply for a role, including contact details such as name, email address, physical address, telephone number
* Information relating to your employment history such as resumé/CV, employment history, qualifications and skills
* If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence
* A record of your progress through any hiring process that we may conduct
* Details of your visits to Workable’s Website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, the site that referred you to Workable’s Website and the resources that you access.

#### Information we collect from other sources

* Workable provides PostHog with the ability to link the data you provide to us, with other publicly available information about you that you have published online, such as on LinkedIn, GitHub or other public social media profiles.
* Workable allows PostHog to search various databases which may include your personal data (include your CV or Resumé), to find possible candidates to fill our job openings. Where we find you in this way, we will obtain your personal data from these sources.
* We may receive your personal data from a third party who recommends you as a candidate for a specific job opening or for our business more generally.

### How we use applicant information

We _only_ collect and use your personal information for the following purposes:

* To communicate with you about the role you have applied for and to manage the recruitment process
* To consider your application for potential future job opportunities

We will never use a candidate's personal information for marketing purposes. 

### Legal basis for processing applicant personal information

If you are a national of countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, we collect and process your personal information on the following legal bases set out by applicable law:

**Consent:** We may ask you for your consent to process your personal information. You can withdraw your consent at any time, which will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn.

**Legitimate Interest:** We process certain personal information for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include, for example, running our recruitment process and managing applicants.

**Compliance with Legal Obligations**: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal information, such as to meet our legal requirements or in response to a court or regulatory order. We also may need to process your personal information to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.

### International data transfer of applicant data

Your personal information may be processed in the United States, the country where you have applied for a job, or any other country where PostHog has team members or operations.

PostHog may transfer, store, or process your personal information in a country outside your jurisdiction, including countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. If we transfer personal information from the EEA, Switzerland, or United Kingdom to a country outside it, such as the United States, we will enter into EU standard contractual clauses with the data importer, or take other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection.

In particular, your data may be accessible to i) Workable’s staff in the USA or ii) may be stored by Workable’s hosting service provider on servers in the USA as well as in the EU. The USA does not have the same data protection laws as the United Kingdom and EEA. A Data Processor Agreement has been signed between Workable Software Limited and its overseas group companies, and between Workable Software Limited and each of its data processors. These data processor agreements are designed to help safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a misuse of your personal data.

### How long we keep applicant personal data

We will hold all the data for 24 months. Prior to that, your personal information will be deleted if:

* You delete your personal information; or
* You write to us asking us to delete your personal information.

### Your rights and choices as an applicant

You may access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time. You may also withdraw your consent, or object to the processing of your personal information when based on our legitimate interests. To do so, please email us at: [careers@posthog.com](mailto:careers@posthog.com)

## Privacy policy changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, PostHog may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in PostHog's sole discretion.

We may also provide notification to users who have provided us email addresses of material changes to this Privacy Policy through our Website. PostHog encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any minor changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

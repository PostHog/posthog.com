good article - https://customergauge.com/blog/nps-csat-ces#NPS%20vs%20CSAT%20vs%20CES:%20In%20Summary10 

Here's what you need to know about NPS, CSAT and CES:

- **NPS (Net** is the percentage of customers who **stop using** your product during a given period of time.

- **Retention rate** is the percentage of **existing customers** who **continue using** your product. 

So, if you have 1,000 customers and 100 of them cancel their subscription, your monthly churn rate would be 10% and your retention rate would be 90%.

In this guide, I'll cover:
- How and when to use each metric
- How to measure churn rate and retention
- Industry benchmarks for churn and retention rates

And... [how to reduce customer churn](#how-to-improve-retention-and-reduce-churn).


## NPS explained üìâ

Promoters are customers that give a score of 9 or 10. They‚Äôre customers that are very happy with their experience and are willing to tell others about it.

Passives give a score of 7 or 8. They aren‚Äôt unhappy with their customer experience, but they‚Äôre not overly thrilled either. Passive customers are more susceptible to competitor offers, and likely won‚Äôt talk about their experience with others, whether that experience has been positive or negative.

Detractors make up the rest of the customer base, giving a score somewhere in the range of 0 to 6. These are people who have had a bad experience with your company, and they‚Äôre likely to complain to others unless you quickly take action to address their concerns.

1. It measures customer loyalty.
Customer NPS helps brands evaluate customer loyalty ‚Äî and the likelihood of them recommending you to a friend. It also helps evaluate the likelihood of customers churning ‚Äî canceling their subscription or not repurchasing and seeking out a product or service from a different company.

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a measure used to gauge customer loyalty, satisfaction, and enthusiasm with a company that‚Äôs calculated by asking customers one question: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this product/company to a friend or colleague?‚Äù Aggregate NPS scores help businesses improve upon service, customer support, delivery, etc. for increased customer loyalty.

**Is it useful for SaaS?**

## How to calculate NPS score

Your NPS score is expressed on a scale of -100 to +100 and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.

So if you have 60% promoters and 10% detractors, your NPS would be 50.

## Benefits of NPS

What are the limitations of NPS?
We‚Äôll be the first to admit that NPS, by itself in a survey, isn‚Äôt always enough to determine the root cause.

So, yes, while NPS is considered the ‚ÄúUltimate Question,‚Äù don‚Äôt be afraid to add additional drivers to this question to more easily determine the root cause of an issue.

Following up is key to taking action. Without it, NPS is just a research tool and doesn‚Äôt drive growth.

### Why should you care about your NPS? / Why is it important

NPS can be used as a predictor of business growth. When your company‚Äôs NPS is high (or, at least, higher than the industry average), you know that you have a healthy relationship with customers who are likely to act as evangelists for the brand, fuel word of mouth, and generate a positive growth cycle.

It helps anticipate churn rate & growth prospects. When you know your current number of detractors and promoters, you‚Äôll predict your growth and customer churn better.

For research, I read several dozen data analyses and finger-in-the-air takes on what "good churn" looks like. Suffice it to say there are contrasting views on the topic.

I've collated the better sources [in the appendix](#more-on-churn-rate-benchmarks). What follows is my own, not-quite-scientific meta-analysis:

- **B2C SaaS:** Subscription services like Netflix or Tidal typically have higher churn than those targeting businesses, so a 3 to 5% monthly churn rate is pretty good. Anything less than 3% is very good, though B2C services are more price sensitive ‚Äì churn trends much lower among services that charge less than $10 per month, for example. A monthly churn rate of 5% is equivalent to annual churn of 46% ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 customers would lose 460 over 12 months.

- **Mid-Market B2B SaaS:** Anything up to 5% monthly churn is OK for a B2B SaaS that **doesn't** sell to big enterprises, but something around 3% is preferable if your average revenue per customer (ARPC) is above $250 per month. Anything below 2% is excellent. A monthly churn rate of 3% is equivalent to 30.6% annually ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 customers would lose 306 over 12 months.

- **Early-stage B2B SaaS:** A monthly churn rate above 5% is to be expected for any early-stage company B2B SaaS, so don't worry too much if you're growing fast, and you're above that benchmark. Just monitor your trend and dig deeper if you don't see it decline as you mature. A monthly churn of 5.65% is equivalent to 50.24% annually ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 companies would lose 502 over 12 months, more than half.

- **Enterprise B2B SaaS:** Products selling to large enterprises (think more than 1,000 employees) have lower churn, mainly because large companies change slowly and are billed annually. A monthly churn rate up to 2% is good. Anything less than 1% is excellent. A monthly churn rate of 1% is equivalent to 11.3% annually ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 customers will lose 114 over 12 months.

Good retention rates are the same, but inverted ‚Äì¬†5% churn equals 95% retention, and so on.

Here's what you need to know about NPS, CSAT and CES:

// TODO write TLDR

## What is NPS?

NPS (net promoter score) measures user loyalty by asking them how they are to recommend you to a friend or coworker. Users submit their response on a scale from 0 (not likely at all) to 10 (extremely likely).

NPS is great as it give you insights to who your loyal customers are, and which of your customers are at risk of churning.

### How to calculate NPS score

Responses are grouped into 3 categories:

- **Promoters** – people who respond with 9 or 10. They're extremely happy with your product.
- **Passives** – people who respond with 7 or 8. They aren’t unhappy, but they’re not overly excited either.
- **Detractors** – people who respond with 6 or below. These are people who have had a bad experience and are likely to complain to others.

![NPS scale](../images/blog/nps-csat-ces/nps-score.png)

You NPS score is the `% of promoters - % of detractors`. The scores range between -100 (100% negative) and +100 (100% positive).

For example, let's say you survey `100` people. `70` people give a promoter score and `20` people give a detractor score. Your NPS would be `70% - 20% = 50%`.

### What is a good NPS score for SaaS?

Anything above 0 is good, above 20 is great, and above 50 is amazing. According to [Satmetrix](https://www.satmetrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NICE-Net-Promoter-Benchmarks-2023.pdf), the average NPS score for software and apps is 27.

Below is table with a benchmark of NPS scores from well-known SaaS products.

### Drawbacks of NPS

NPS can be tricky because it's often contextless. It gives you an indication of your users' sentiment toward your product, but not much else.

To counteract this, it's best to ask follow up questions in your NPS survey:

- Which features do you find most useful?
- What are you finding difficult to do?
- Is there a feature or aspect of the product that particularly disappoints you?
- What would it take to improve your score to a 9 or 10?
- Would you be open to a follow-up call to discuss your feedback in more detail?

### When to use NPS surveys

Since NPS survey questions are broad, they are particularly useful for gauging long-term user satisfaction, rather than immediate or short-term feedback. 

It's best to wait for users to have a chance to properly experience your product, and so NPS surveys are best for existing users and not new ones.

With this in mind, it's a good idea to run NPS surveys to a group of users every month or quarter to get an understanding of how their experience is changing over time. This enables you to identify trends in how your product changes are affecting your user experience.


## CSAT explained

https://userpilot.com/blog/csat-survey-template/#What-are-CSAT-surveys?

happy customers / number of customers ask

"How satisfied are you with "product"

CSAT is great because…
It’s specific. CSAT questions can be tailored to specific parts of your business, helping you to find out where customers feel satisfied and where they don’t. That should make it easy to find out where there are areas for improvement.

CSAT can be tricky because…
It’s narrow. Your customer satisfaction score’s specificity is a double-edged sword: that also means that customers can answer only about what’s being asked – and nothing more. This can create contextual information gaps if you’re not being thorough.



Using a CSAT survey, you can ask customers to rate your product or service. The scale can range from 1-10 or 1-5 or 1-7 on an “extremely dissatisfied – extremely satisfied” basis. You can calculate the CSAT scores by dividing the number of happy customers by the number of total customers asked.

The customer satisfaction (CSAT) score is a metric that measures how customers feel about your product and how many satisfied customers you have across your total user pool.

Measuring customer satisfaction comes down to dividing the number of happy customers by the total number of customers surveyed. If 80 survey responses rate their satisfaction at an eight or higher and you surveyed 100 customers then your CSAT score is 80%.

Avoid asking more than two survey questions in a single customer satisfaction survey to maximize response rates and improve the accuracy of any actionable feedback you manage to collect.


“How would you rate your overall satisfaction with the product(s)/service(s) you received from [company name]?”

The customer then usually has a range of options to choose from, such as:

A numerical score from 1 to 3, 1 to 5, or 1 to 10.
Verbal indicators such as “very unsatisfied,” “unsatisfied,” “neutral,” “satisfied,” and “very satisfied.”
International symbols such as emojis or rating stars.


## Why CSAT is important / what you can learn from it

https://equals.com/learn/metrics/customer-satisfaction-score/

Retention and churn: High customer satisfaction indicates that clients are likely to continue using your service. Conversely, low CSAT scores often correlate with high churn rates. Keeping existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

CSAT is better for end of specific interaction with a feature. NPS is for longer term, overall interaction with your product.

Customer loyalty: Satisfied clients are more likely to recommend your service to others, which can lead to increased word-of-mouth marketing and organic growth.

Feedback loop: Regularly monitoring CSAT scores and customer feedback can help identify areas needing improvement, allowing you to address issues in a timely manner and maintain a high-quality product.

Competitive advantage: Achieving high CSAT scores positions your company as a leader in your industry and helps to differentiate your solution from competitors.


This difference is made clear with the built-in connotation of the words “satisfaction” and “recommendation.” **Satisfaction tends to be a more short-lived sentiment, while recommendation tends to be harder won and long term**. 

In short, just because someone is satisfied, doesn’t mean they’d recommend you to a friend.



## When should you use a CSAT survey?

You should use a CSAT survey after specific interactions for real-time feedback and accurate insight into your customer service delivery.

Try to use a CSAT survey after the following key interactions in the customer journey:

Customer onboarding process
Customer support interactions
Specific feature usage
Before a renewal
You can also use it regularly to assess overall customer health and identify pain points.

When should you measure CSAT?

CSAT surveys should be measured right after meaningful touchpoints or milestones. For example:

After closing a support ticket ‒ to evaluate the performance of your support reps and the quality of your customer service.

After finishing a trial period ‒ to see if customers like your product and if they found it useful.

After making a purchase ‒ to detect any potential issues or bottlenecks.

## CES explained

"Is "product" easy to use?"

CES stands for Customer Effort Score. A good CES definition outlines it as a metric that’s used to measure customer satisfaction levels by focusing on the efforts customers make to interact with your business’ services and products.

The idea is for the survey to help you find out if customers have a hard time performing certain actions when interacting with your brand, and take the necessary actions according to the survey data to streamline processes.



The customer effort score (CES) is a metric that measures how easy it is for customers to interact and engage with your products or services.

Customer Effort Score (CES) is a metric that measures the effort required by a customer to interact with your business.
Measuring your CES allows you to identify where the problem lies, leading to less friction and better customer experience.

What makes it difficult to use? (better to ask this than easier to use, since users are bad at telling you what they want)

Measuring Customer Effort Score leads to less friction, as you can now identify where your users need help.

Are they facing issues engaging with a feature? How much effort does it take for them to contact support?

## When should you use a CES survey?
You can get the best output by using CES surveys after your customer:

Engages with a feature for the first time
Engages with customer support or success
Reaches a milestone in the customer journey
Has used the product for a long time
Here is how Nicereply uses the CES survey.

## How to measure customer effort score?
CES is measured using a survey that asks a specific question related to the user experience after engaging with parts of the product or your team. The survey either uses a numerical scale from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 or emoticons with angry to happy faces to make it more engaging and easy for the user.

The most commonly used channels to send a CES survey are in-app and email.

When to use a CES vs. CSAT vs. NPS survey
Customer Effort Score (CES), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), and Net Promoter Score (NPS) are the most known customer satisfaction surveys. Each of these comes with its unique benefits, and you should use all to collect different types of insights.

While the CES survey is a very useful tool, it can be too narrowly focused in a single interaction, causing you to ignore the big picture. But if you use it along with NPS and CSAT, you’ll get a better idea about the overall situation of customer experience for your product.

CES surveys
CES surveys can be used to assess the perceived effort in completing a specific task. It’s best for collecting more granular insights.

CES surveys are best sent:

After engaging with a feature for the first time
After engaging with customer support or success
After reaching a milestone in the customer journey
CSAT surveys
CSAT surveys assess the short-term satisfaction with either your product or the service offered. It can give you an overview of how happy the customer is, while CES tells you what’s making them happy or not.

CSAT surveys are best sent:

After reaching a milestone in the journey (for example, reaching the activation point)
After engaging with customer support (a most common practice in SaaS).

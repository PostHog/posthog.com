Here's what you need to know about NPS, CSAT and CES:

- **NPS (Net** is the percentage of customers who **stop using** your product during a given period of time.

- **Retention rate** is the percentage of **existing customers** who **continue using** your product. 

So, if you have 1,000 customers and 100 of them cancel their subscription, your monthly churn rate would be 10% and your retention rate would be 90%.

In this guide, I'll cover:
- How and when to use each metric
- How to measure churn rate and retention
- Industry benchmarks for churn and retention rates

And... [how to reduce customer churn](#how-to-improve-retention-and-reduce-churn).


## NPS explained üìâ

Promoters are customers that give a score of 9 or 10. They‚Äôre customers that are very happy with their experience and are willing to tell others about it.

Passives give a score of 7 or 8. They aren‚Äôt unhappy with their customer experience, but they‚Äôre not overly thrilled either. Passive customers are more susceptible to competitor offers, and likely won‚Äôt talk about their experience with others, whether that experience has been positive or negative.

Detractors make up the rest of the customer base, giving a score somewhere in the range of 0 to 6. These are people who have had a bad experience with your company, and they‚Äôre likely to complain to others unless you quickly take action to address their concerns.

1. It measures customer loyalty.
Customer NPS helps brands evaluate customer loyalty ‚Äî and the likelihood of them recommending you to a friend. It also helps evaluate the likelihood of customers churning ‚Äî canceling their subscription or not repurchasing and seeking out a product or service from a different company.

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a measure used to gauge customer loyalty, satisfaction, and enthusiasm with a company that‚Äôs calculated by asking customers one question: ‚ÄúOn a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this product/company to a friend or colleague?‚Äù Aggregate NPS scores help businesses improve upon service, customer support, delivery, etc. for increased customer loyalty.

NPS is broad

NPS is great because‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs simple and standardised	
NPS surveys tend to have high completion rates because they‚Äôre short and simple to understand. They‚Äôre also easy to use to benchmark, helping you see where you stand in relation to the rest of your industry.	

NPS can be tricky because‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs often contextless	
An NPS score gives you an overall indication of customer loyalty, but not much else ‚Äì including things customers don‚Äôt like. So it‚Äôs important to gather it in conjunction with other (qualitative) data.	
**Is it useful for SaaS?**

## How to calculate NPS score

Your NPS score is expressed on a scale of -100 to +100 and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.

So if you have 60% promoters and 10% detractors, your NPS would be 50.

## Benefits of NPS

What are the limitations of NPS?
We‚Äôll be the first to admit that NPS, by itself in a survey, isn‚Äôt always enough to determine the root cause.

So, yes, while NPS is considered the ‚ÄúUltimate Question,‚Äù don‚Äôt be afraid to add additional drivers to this question to more easily determine the root cause of an issue.

Following up is key to taking action. Without it, NPS is just a research tool and doesn‚Äôt drive growth.

### Why should you care about your NPS? / Why is it important / When should you use a NPS survey?


NPS can be used as a predictor of business growth. When your company‚Äôs NPS is high (or, at least, higher than the industry average), you know that you have a healthy relationship with customers who are likely to act as evangelists for the brand, fuel word of mouth, and generate a positive growth cycle.

It helps anticipate churn rate & growth prospects. When you know your current number of detractors and promoters, you‚Äôll predict your growth and customer churn better.

When should you use an NPS survey?
Finding the right moment to use an NPS survey in the case of SaaS products can be a bit tricky. But you can break the customer journey into two phases ‚Äì the early phase and the ongoing phase, to get more accurate feedback.

Here is how you can use NPS in each phase:

Early phase: Send an NPS survey after the customer has finished the onboarding process and used the product or service for some time. But ensure that you don‚Äôt send it right after the customer starts using the product, as they won‚Äôt have enough feedback to share with you.
Ongoing phase: Use NPS surveys at various touchpoints throughout your customer‚Äôs lifecycle with your product. It will help you understand how they feel about your customer experience.
Try to send an NPS follow-up question to understand why a customer has given you a specific score.

For research, I read several dozen data analyses and finger-in-the-air takes on what "good churn" looks like. Suffice it to say there are contrasting views on the topic.

I've collated the better sources [in the appendix](#more-on-churn-rate-benchmarks). What follows is my own, not-quite-scientific meta-analysis:

- **B2C SaaS:** Subscription services like Netflix or Tidal typically have higher churn than those targeting businesses, so a 3 to 5% monthly churn rate is pretty good. Anything less than 3% is very good, though B2C services are more price sensitive ‚Äì churn trends much lower among services that charge less than $10 per month, for example. A monthly churn rate of 5% is equivalent to annual churn of 46% ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 customers would lose 460 over 12 months.

- **Mid-Market B2B SaaS:** Anything up to 5% monthly churn is OK for a B2B SaaS that **doesn't** sell to big enterprises, but something around 3% is preferable if your average revenue per customer (ARPC) is above $250 per month. Anything below 2% is excellent. A monthly churn rate of 3% is equivalent to 30.6% annually ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 customers would lose 306 over 12 months.

- **Early-stage B2B SaaS:** A monthly churn rate above 5% is to be expected for any early-stage company B2B SaaS, so don't worry too much if you're growing fast, and you're above that benchmark. Just monitor your trend and dig deeper if you don't see it decline as you mature. A monthly churn of 5.65% is equivalent to 50.24% annually ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 companies would lose 502 over 12 months, more than half.

- **Enterprise B2B SaaS:** Products selling to large enterprises (think more than 1,000 employees) have lower churn, mainly because large companies change slowly and are billed annually. A monthly churn rate up to 2% is good. Anything less than 1% is excellent. A monthly churn rate of 1% is equivalent to 11.3% annually ‚Äì i.e. a company with 1,000 customers will lose 114 over 12 months.

Good retention rates are the same, but inverted ‚Äì¬†5% churn equals 95% retention, and so on.



## CSAT explained

https://userpilot.com/blog/csat-survey-template/#What-are-CSAT-surveys?

happy customers / number of customers ask

"How satisfied are you with "product"

CSAT is great because‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs specific. CSAT questions can be tailored to specific parts of your business, helping you to find out where customers feel satisfied and where they don‚Äôt. That should make it easy to find out where there are areas for improvement.

CSAT can be tricky because‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs narrow. Your customer satisfaction score‚Äôs specificity is a double-edged sword: that also means that customers can answer only about what‚Äôs being asked ‚Äì and nothing more. This can create contextual information gaps if you‚Äôre not being thorough.



Using a CSAT survey, you can ask customers to rate your product or service. The scale can range from 1-10 or 1-5 or 1-7 on an ‚Äúextremely dissatisfied ‚Äì extremely satisfied‚Äù basis. You can calculate the CSAT scores by dividing the number of happy customers by the number of total customers asked.

The customer satisfaction (CSAT) score is a metric that measures how customers feel about your product and how many satisfied customers you have across your total user pool.

Measuring customer satisfaction comes down to dividing the number of happy customers by the total number of customers surveyed. If 80 survey responses rate their satisfaction at an eight or higher and you surveyed 100 customers then your CSAT score is 80%.

Avoid asking more than two survey questions in a single customer satisfaction survey to maximize response rates and improve the accuracy of any actionable feedback you manage to collect.


‚ÄúHow would you rate your overall satisfaction with the product(s)/service(s) you received from [company name]?‚Äù

The customer then usually has a range of options to choose from, such as:

A numerical score from 1 to 3, 1 to 5, or 1 to 10.
Verbal indicators such as ‚Äúvery unsatisfied,‚Äù ‚Äúunsatisfied,‚Äù ‚Äúneutral,‚Äù ‚Äúsatisfied,‚Äù and ‚Äúvery satisfied.‚Äù
International symbols such as emojis or rating stars.


## Why CSAT is important / what you can learn from it

https://equals.com/learn/metrics/customer-satisfaction-score/

Retention and churn: High customer satisfaction indicates that clients are likely to continue using your service. Conversely, low CSAT scores often correlate with high churn rates. Keeping existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Customer loyalty: Satisfied clients are more likely to recommend your service to others, which can lead to increased word-of-mouth marketing and organic growth.

Feedback loop: Regularly monitoring CSAT scores and customer feedback can help identify areas needing improvement, allowing you to address issues in a timely manner and maintain a high-quality product.

Competitive advantage: Achieving high CSAT scores positions your company as a leader in your industry and helps to differentiate your solution from competitors.


This difference is made clear with the built-in connotation of the words ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù and ‚Äúrecommendation.‚Äù **Satisfaction tends to be a more short-lived sentiment, while recommendation tends to be harder won and long term**. 
In short, just because someone is satisfied, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôd recommend you to a friend.



## When should you use a CSAT survey?

You should use a CSAT survey after specific interactions for real-time feedback and accurate insight into your customer service delivery.

Try to use a CSAT survey after the following key interactions in the customer journey:

Customer onboarding process
Customer support interactions
Specific feature usage
Before a renewal
You can also use it regularly to assess overall customer health and identify pain points.



## CES explained

"Is "product" easy to use?"

The customer effort score (CES) is a metric that measures how easy it is for customers to interact and engage with your products or services.

Customer Effort Score (CES) is a metric that measures the effort required by a customer to interact with your business.
Measuring your CES allows you to identify where the problem lies, leading to less friction and better customer experience.


What could we do to make it easier to use
What makes it difficult to use? (better to ask this than easier to use, since users are bad at telling you what they want)

Measuring Customer Effort Score leads to less friction, as you can now identify where your users need help.

Are they facing issues engaging with a feature? How much effort does it take for them to contact support?

## When should you use a CES survey?
You can get the best output by using CES surveys after your customer:

Engages with a feature for the first time
Engages with customer support or success
Reaches a milestone in the customer journey
Has used the product for a long time
Here is how Nicereply uses the CES survey.

## How to measure customer effort score?
CES is measured using a survey that asks a specific question related to the user experience after engaging with parts of the product or your team. The survey either uses a numerical scale from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 or emoticons with angry to happy faces to make it more engaging and easy for the user.

The most commonly used channels to send a CES survey are in-app and email.

When to use a CES vs. CSAT vs. NPS survey
Customer Effort Score (CES), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), and Net Promoter Score (NPS) are the most known customer satisfaction surveys. Each of these comes with its unique benefits, and you should use all to collect different types of insights.

While the CES survey is a very useful tool, it can be too narrowly focused in a single interaction, causing you to ignore the big picture. But if you use it along with NPS and CSAT, you‚Äôll get a better idea about the overall situation of customer experience for your product.

CES surveys
CES surveys can be used to assess the perceived effort in completing a specific task. It‚Äôs best for collecting more granular insights.

CES surveys are best sent:

After engaging with a feature for the first time
After engaging with customer support or success
After reaching a milestone in the customer journey
CSAT surveys
CSAT surveys assess the short-term satisfaction with either your product or the service offered. It can give you an overview of how happy the customer is, while CES tells you what‚Äôs making them happy or not.

CSAT surveys are best sent:

After reaching a milestone in the journey (for example, reaching the activation point)
After engaging with customer support (a most common practice in SaaS).

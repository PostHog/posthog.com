Back in the day, companies could see how people were interacting with their products. They could talk to them, knock on their door, and give them a firm handshake. Now, many companies have no direct interactions with their users. Instead, they rely on behavioral analytics. 

Behavioral analytics is the data about the usage of your site or app. It is a combination of a user and an action. Looking at this data, both individually and in aggregate, enables you to monitor the experience you are providing, identify popular features, and discover areas needing improvement.

As an engineer, you might not think of this data as important to you, but you should. An app is shaped by its users, whether they are external or internal. Everything you build is in service to better help users (at some point), and analytics is core to understanding what they want. To help you do this, this post goes over how to get started and use behavioral analytics as an engineer. 

## 1. Start small

If you start with behavorial analytics by trying to create the perfect solution, you will find yourself frustrated. This is because there are many types of behavior you can track and it is often the most unexpected ones that are the most valuable.

Other guides recommend doing a lot of planning before implementation. They encourage you to "map your customer journey" and develop a "tracking plan." We're more "[jump off the cliff and build an airplane on the way down](https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/1481071139221049345?lang=en)" type people at PostHog.  

Instead, we recommend starting by tracking one specific area and expanding from there. For example, track the usage of the feature you are responsible for. To capture this, you can rely on PostHog's [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) and create an [action](/docs/data/actions) representing usage or you can capture a [custom event](/docs/getting-started/send-events#2-capture-custom-events). Examples from our products include insight, dashboard, and replay analyzed or feature flag, experiment, and survey created. 

Starting small enables you to get the basics implemented and begin to develop a sense of the value of data. Even with a single data point, you can create [trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends), breakdowns, [retention charts](/docs/product-analytics/retention), and more. Once you grasp this, it reveals other data points you'd like to include and you can build on what you've done.

## 2. Get user identification right

One-half of behavioral data is the **user**. Setting up accurate [user identification](/docs/getting-started/identify-users) from the start reaps massive rewards as the amount of data you capture grows. This is because it is difficult to change user data on large numbers of historical events and small implementation errors can create large discrepancies.

To ensure you set up accurate user identification, start by understanding how user data works in PostHog. All events have user data, known as [persons](/docs/data/persons). With the [JavaScript web library](/docs/libraries/js), users are anonymous until you identify them with a distinct ID. Other libraries and the API require a distinct ID for event capture. Beyond this, it is important for the implementation to:

- Use a unique distinct ID.
- Avoid using many different `distinct_id` values for the same user.
- On the frontend, call identify as soon as possible (on load or login).
- Reset on logout or when a user changes.

As an engineer, it is up to you to get user identification right. Everyone relying on behavioral analytics (both technical and not) will assume the data is right, and from our experience, this goes wrong more than you think. Double-check and test your identification code. To be even more careful, tie it to your authorization code.

> **Tip:** For examples of what "right" looks like, check out [our logic for identifying users](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/6b258dcaf67c03d31b72a3916a72fc893f0c883a/frontend/src/scenes/userLogic.ts#L124), look for other examples of `posthog.identify()` on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=posthog.identify+NOT+language%3APHP+NOT+language%3APython&type=code), or integrate with an auth provider like [PropelAuth](https://www.propelauth.com/post/posthog-propelauth).

## 3. Utilize session replay

One of the fastest time-to-insight behavioral analytics tools you can set up is [session replay](/session-replay). You might think of this as a tool for marketers and product managers, but engineers can benefit from it too.

Replays focus on the behavior of an individual user. This gives them a high density of information. It isn't only a single event or an aggregate of events, rather all of their behavior visualized as they do it. This reveals gaps between expected experience and reality.

A unique benefit to engineers is that session replays are a great tool for debugging user issues. Instead of asking for information, you can see where the issue happened, its recreation, and get important context like person information, network performance, and console logs.

> **Tip:** Add session replay links to your support tickets for easy access. We have a tutorial for how to do this with [Zendesk](/tutorials/zendesk-session-replays).

## 4. Track releases and measure success

If you're not careful, you can spend too much time looking at behavioral analytics (especially if it's heading in the right direction). Instead, you should plan to monitor it when it can make the most impact, and a prime time for that is feature launches.

No matter how perfect you think your implementation is, there is always a chance it goes wrong. Users always seem to find ways to break or use features in unintended ways. Behavioral analytics enables you to monitor launches, visualize if something unexpected is happening, and pinpoint potential areas needing fixes. 

PostHog is an especially good tool for this because it combines behavioral analytics tools like product analytics and session replay with developer tools like:

- **A/B testing** to ensure the changes make a statistically significant impact on the behavioral metrics you care about.

- **Feature flags** to target users based on properties and safely rollback features when data looks bad.

When you use either of these, you can easily filter insights, dashboards (including [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics)), and replays for users interacting with that feature.

## 5. Weave data into your decision-making

When writing about behavioral analytics, other guides tell you to use the data to "make better decisions." They just tell you to "analyze your data" but rarely provide details about where, when, and how. 

Beyond the use cases already covered in this post, engineers can use behavioral analytics in their decision-making in three main ways:

1. **Monitor your direction.** Track metrics over the long term and make changes if heading in the wrong direction. Look at [product health](/product-engineers/product-health-metrics), [product-market fit](/founders/measure-product-market-fit), and [north star](/founders/north-star-metrics) metrics. This helps you prioritize and tweak what you're focusing on. [Dashboards](/templates?filter=type&value=dashboard) are a great tool for this.  

2. **Dive deeper into hunches.** If some area is underperforming, behavioral analytics can provide evidence. For example, you might get feedback saying onboarding is too complicated. You can research this by checking for behavior across the onboarding funnel and use those insights to test improvements. [Notebooks](/docs/notebooks) are a great tool for this.

3. **Fit functionality to user behavior.** Behavioral analytics enables you to predict and plan for different scenarios. For example, what performance levels do we need to support? By understanding the average, minimum, and maximum use cases, you get more guidance on what you need the system to do and make better tradeoffs.

The use cases beyond these likely are beyond the scope of your work as an engineer. If you can use all of these, you likely grasp behavioral analytics better than 95% of engineers, and are well on your way to becoming a [product engineer](/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer).

## Why We're Here

PostHog is increasing the number of successful products in the world.

We do that by providing a platform for open-source product analytics. This helps software teams understand their user behavior.

The analytics landscape has historically been very fragmented. There are many tools that provide value individually, but integrating the basic features across many verticals provides much more value.

Today, we are focussed on community growth around our open source project. We aim to provide the core features of many tools, that traditionally would all sit in silos. This, coupled with the ability to use the software for free, for life, is making PostHog a no-brainer for every new software project.

We've made a crazy amount of progress to date.

We took party in [Y Combinator's](https://www.ycombinator.com/) W20 cohort, and had the most succesful B2B software launch on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) since 2012, with just a 4 week old product.

Our GitHub repo has over over 3k stars (and growing fast), and we already have thousands of users, including deployments at large companies. 

We're backed by some of the world's top investors and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales team and regular cold calls.

What does this mean for you? We have a lot of capital, but we're a lean, strong team - so you've the opportunity to have a huge impact.

## Our Culture

As a young company, our culture is still being polished by our growing team, and, as one of our first hires, you'll play an important role in shaping it. 

A few things have already emerged as key:

##### All Remote

We are _fully remote_ and hire anywhere in the world. After all, why limit your talent pool? If you're a fit, we want you on board. 

Currently, no two PostHog members live in the same city, not even our co-founders! But don't worry, we'll still hire you even if you do share a city with a team member.

##### Diversity

Being fully remote means we're able to create a team that is _truly_ diverse.

In our view, a non-traditional team is how we build a special company. We believe diversity leads to the best results and encourage applicants from any background or experience to drop us a note. 

Furthermore, to ensure we can support the needs of our diverse team well, we offer unlimited time off (minimum 25 days!), don't track hours (work hard when you work), and [offer generous parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off#parental-leave) independent of gender. 

As part of our commitment to diversity, we are willing to sponsor visas for those who need them.

##### Transparency

As the builders of an open-source product, we believe it is only right that we be as transparent as possible as a company.

And this isn't just a meaningless corporate statement. Most of our communication happens publicly on GitHub, our roadmap is open for anyone to see, and this website hosts a [comprehensive handbook](/handbook) explaining anything from how we hire and pay employees to how we email investors!

We're committed to much more than just public code.

##### Written communication

We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world. With team members across several countries, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, pull requests, and (minimally) Slack.

Putting things in writing helps us clarify our own ideas, as well as allow others to provide better feedback. It has been key to our development and growth.

## Our Backers

We're young, but we're already [backed](/handbook/strategy/investors) by many of the best investors in the world and have [raised millions of dollars in funding](/blog/raising-3m-for-os).

This includes YCombinator, Solomon Hykes (Founder of Docker), David Cramer (Founder/CEO of Sentry), Adam Goldstein (Founder of Hipmunk), and [many more](/handbook/strategy/investors).

## The Process

We will schedule 2 to 3 short calls with our founders and team. These will focus on two key areas:

* Ensuring you will be a great cultural fit
* Aptitude for the role

If you succeed with the above, we will set you up with a *PostHog SuperDay*.

This is a *paid* day of working with us, which we will fit around your schedule. Getting hired by us is extremely challenging, and this will be a big day. You'll need to be fully engaged with a steady supply of tea, coffee and biscuits.

We set you up with a slack channel with several of our core team. We'll give you a variety of tasks to work on. We are looking for your ability to iterate, to get things live, to learn, to take initiative, and to prioritize.

This way, you'll get a chance to see how we work, and we'll get a chance to see how you get on during the equivalent of a very busy day. And you'll be getting paid, of course.

## Benefits

* [Unlimited, permissionless vacation](/handbook/people/time-off) with a 25 day minimum
* Health insurance provided or the cost covered depending on jurisdiction
* [Generous parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off#parental-leave)
* Visa sponsorship
* [Training budget](/handbook/people/training#training-budget) (role dependent)
* $200/month [budget towards coworking or café working](/handbook/people/spending-money#work-space)
* Carbon offsetting for work travel with [Project Wren](https://projectwren.com/) 
* Free [books](/handbook/people/training#books)

# Open Roles

## Unspecified

We take exceptional people when they come along, and we really mean that.

If you do *not* see a specific role listed, that really doesn't mean we won't have a spot for you.

We take this applications seriously, and that's why they're listed above our other roles - you won't just end up in a candidate database, we will either hire you, reject you, or give you some insight into when may make more sense to apply.

## UX Developer/Engineer

PostHog is building its first design team. We are looking for a proactive, fast, and passionate UX Developer to take our design to a world class level. Our product and website went viral with a basic MVP, and we're determined to be best-in-class with our UX.

The role would involve:

* Collaborating with our Designer to make sure we get a cool '80s vibe into our website and docs!
* Implementing design changes to our website, docs, and product.
* Collaborating with our Engineering team to ensure our product is simple and intuitive even to answer complex analytics queries.

The perfect candidate for this role must be as comfortable working with a designer in Figma (where our designer creates components) and working in React. It will involve a lot of rolling up sleeves and getting stuck in.

## Fullstack Engineer

### Your Role

As an early engineer (we currently have a team of 5 in total), you'll be key to building a lot of the core functionality of PostHog. We encourage you to take a look at our repo (issues and PRs) to see the types of things you'd be doing.

We're looking for people who are *proactive* and are *ridiculously quick* at getting new features out, while writing test and generally maintaining a clean codebase.

# Get Started - Applying

Email a thoughtful cover letter to [tim@posthog.com](mailto:tim@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* What makes you a great early hire into our first 15 people

* Relevant experience/projects you've done (including links if possible)
* Links to your LinkedIn / resume / GitHub (optional)
* How you found us

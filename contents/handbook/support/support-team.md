The <SmallTeam slug="support">support team</SmallTeam> exists to help our users succeed with PostHog, and we do that differently than most support teams.

We're not a ticket-routing operation. We genuinely care about making our users' experience exceptional, which we do by being a deeply technical team that takes pride in solving problems ourselves. We write code, ship fixes, update docs, and build internal tooling to deliver that experience. We move fast, stay humble, and believe that great support is about empowering users, not just answering questions.

## What makes us great

We communicate clearly and don't hide behind jargon. We're relentlessly curious - pulling at every thread when investigating an issue, and seeing the bigger picture beyond the immediate problem. We're always looking for ways to improve, whether that's our processes, our docs, or our own skills. We're thorough without being slow, thoughtful without overthinking, and we genuinely care about getting things right for our users.

## Our values

### Take ownership

Own your work from start to finish. Be proactive and self-driven. Don't wait to be told what to do. When you see a problem, jump in and solve it. Be resourceful, curious, and hands-on. If something needs doing, figure it out and make it happen. Taking ownership means being accountable for outcomes, not just tasks.

### Delight users

Go beyond solving problems. Create moments that make users' days better. Be genuinely caring, reassuringly human, and empathetic in every interaction. Surprise users with your thoughtfulness and responsiveness. Bring positivity and warmth to technical conversations. When users walk away from an interaction with you, they should feel helped, valued, and maybe even a little delighted.

### Stay humble

Check your ego at the door. Take feedback as a gift and be open to learning from anyone, regardless of their experience level or role. Share knowledge freely with the team and communicate with transparency and honesty. We get better together by staying curious, admitting what we don't know, and helping each other grow. No one has all the answers, and that's okay.

### Ship fixes

Be deeply technical and hands-on. Don't just log bugs or pass tickets along - write the fix yourself. Raise PRs for docs improvements, patch code, and solve problems end-to-end. We're engineers who happen to do support, not support agents who escalate to engineers. If you can fix it, ship it. That's what makes PostHog support special.

## Why we have SMEs

As we add more products to PostHog, it becomes more difficult for individual support engineers to effectively work across every product. SMEs help us maintain deep expertise across our product areas while ensuring every ticket gets answered by someone who really knows their stuff.

This structure helps us own our product areas completely, build the knowledge needed to delight users with better and faster answers, and develop close relationships with product teams so we can advocate for fixes and features that actually matter to users.

## Product ownership

All technical support engineers share responsibility for:
- **Analytics products** (analytics platform, customer analytics, product analytics, web analytics, growth)
- **Unclassified tickets** (tickets in the 'Support' group). Where possible, these tickets should be updated with the correct product group.

Beyond that, we have SMEs who own specific product areas. For each area, we select one person from EU and one from NA to maintain timezone coverage.

### SME areas and owners

**Flags** (experiments, feature flags, surveys)
- EU: <TeamMember name="Ben Lea" photo />, NA: <TeamMember name="Joshua Ordehi" photo />

**Data** (batch exports, data stack, ingestion, workflows)
- EU: <TeamMember name="Luke Belton" photo />, NA: <TeamMember name="Kyle Swank" photo />

**Replay** (replay, heatmaps, toolbar)
- EU: <TeamMember name="Christian Rafferty" photo />, NA: <TeamMember name="Ben Haynes" photo />

**Observability + AI & SDK/Implementation** (error tracking, PostHog AI, LLM analytics, SDK/Implementation, mobile)
- EU: TBD, NA: <TeamMember name="Steven Shults" photo />

**A note on these groupings**: These SME areas are based on current ticket volumes. As products grow or new ones launch, we'll split or reorganize them. This structure is designed to evolve with our needs.

## What SMEs actually do

Being an SME means you're the go-to person for your product area. This breaks down into two key aspects:

### Own the customer perspective
- Maintain oversight of all tickets in your product area
- Spot patterns and common themes
- Understand what bugs are frustrating users most
- Know what features users are asking for

### Partner with engineering teams
- Build good relationships with the engineering teams who own your products
- Consider attending their standups occasionally (you don't need to go to every one)
- Keep an eye on their Slack channels to know what's recently shipped and what's being worked on
- Understand what's on their roadmap
- Bring customer context to help with their quarterly planning - what bugs are most prominent, what features users want most

## How to work as an SME

### Your Zendesk views

Each SME area has a dedicated view in Zendesk that includes:
- Tickets created from Slack channels
- Tickets submitted via the help sidebar
- Community questions

These views contain tickets from your specific SME area (see groupings above) **and** all shared product areas (analytics and unclassified tickets). If there are any unclassified tickets that appear in your view (tickets in the 'Support' group), then where possible please assign these to the correct product group. Let <TeamMember name="Abigail Richardson" photo /> know if there are certain types of tickets which regularly appear in the 'Support' group.

**Important**: These views show tickets assigned to other team members too, giving you full context of your area. Jump in if you know something off the top of your head or see someone stuck.

### Your daily workflow

Start your day with your SME views. Build your knowledge. Get really good at your products. Once you're on top of your SME queue, move to the [Technical support shared view](https://posthoghelp.zendesk.com/agent/filters/32900756121627) which has all tickets the technical support team is responsible for.

**But here's the key**: you're not locked into only your SME products. The goal is expertise, not silos. If you're caught up and the shared queue needs attention, dive in. If you're swamped and someone else can help with your SME queue, ask for it.

### Coverage and coordination

You and your SME counterpart in the other timezone should work together to:
- Share knowledge, patterns, and themes you're seeing in tickets
- Coordinate on holiday planning - can you stagger time off to maintain coverage?
- Call out when your SME queue is especially busy and you need help
- Communicate in #team-support about coverage gaps or when you need backup

As we grow, we'll need less manual coordination. For now, always consider coverage and communicate proactively.

**TL;DR:** Mid term, it's $100 million ARR by 2026, working backwards from there. Longer term, outcompete top-down competitors worth $50 billion. If we get that far, we'll have helped _tens of millions_ of engineers build better products.

## Will PostHog sell?

What motivates us is building an epic product and company.

We're excited by:

* Figuring out how far we can go
* Helping engineers build products - reduce the need for product and data teams
* Beating all the point solution competitors
* Having customers buy _from_ us instead of us selling _to_ them

We're *not* excited by:

* Selling the company for $1 billion – we think we can build a much bigger company by staying independent

## $100M by 2026

We want to hit $100 million in annual revenue by the end of 2026.

We've set this since it's ambitious and keeps us accountable for some kind of financial output, but working backwards we can do it. We need around 7% monthly revenue growth to hit this.

## Secondaries over selling

Everyone at PostHog has options in the company – that means they can be a shareholder. This keeps everyone focused on our long-term interests.

However, at different stages of the company's life, the value of each person's stock may be hundreds of thousands, millions, or even tens of millions of dollars. If someone doesn't have much capital but has $10 million in stock options, they'll start wanting us to sell.

As a result, we aim to let people sell some of their stock when we fundraise and once their stock has very significantly increased in value. This helps keep everyone focused on building something bigger and longer term. What we can offer will depend on what we can negotiate every time we fundraise, but this is our general philosophy.

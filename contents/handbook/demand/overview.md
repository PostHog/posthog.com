> Technically, most of what we do is *demand capture* – converting existing intent into action. That intent often comes from word of mouth or brand-driven awareness. That’s the real demand gen. But for the sake of clarity, we’re calling this "demand gen" because that's what people usually call it in the industry.

## Why this team exists

We’re in a strong position today. We’ve got a healthy volume of high-quality inbound leads driven by word of mouth and general brand love/awareness. That won’t last forever.

There are two main reasons this team exists:

- **Lead flow can’t be taken for granted.** Inbound may look great now, but it takes 4–6 months to fix a pipeline once it starts to flatten. By the time you realize it's slowing, you’re already behind. This team will ensure we stay ahead of the curve.
- **Cross-selling gets harder as we scale.** In larger organizations, different teams often own different tools. One team might be responsible for analytics, another for feature flags. That makes it harder to grow within existing accounts. Smart, personalized ABM (account-based marketing) helps AEs and CSMs expand usage across teams.

## What we’re here to do

- Deliver a consistent stream of high-quality sales leads  
- Use ABM to reach new people inside large accounts already using PostHog  
- Build a system that scales to $500k/month in spend while keeping [CAC payback](https://stripe.com/gb/resources/more/what-is-the-cac-payback-period) best-in-class
- Ensure we’re working effectively with our external demand gen agency 

### Growth reviews

Brian runs monthly marketing growth reviews, which cover:

- Top-of-funnel and conversion metrics
- Paid channel performance
- Return on ad spend
- Specific campaigns, any new stuff we want to launch

### What is a “lead”?

A lead is someone who has either:

- **Signed up** for PostHog ([we score these](/growth/sales/lead-scoring) to prioritize follow-up)  
- **Requested a demo** through the site  

We don’t gate content or the product. We don’t rely on shady tactics or clickbait. If someone wants to try the product or talk to us, we make it easy.

## Channels we focus on

We put effort where the intent is highest:

- **Google Search** – high-converting, scalable  
- **LinkedIn** – good for enterprise ABM  
- **Reddit** – early traction, lots of room to grow  
- **X** – low quality so far, but we're experimenting

## ABM: Account-Based Marketing

ABM is about targeting specific companies and individuals based on context, rather than keywords. In order of priority, these are the kinds of scenarios we want to help with:

- A sales rep wants to cross-sell to another team inside an account, but they don’t have the contact  
- We're in a competitive RFP process, and we want to subtly influence decision-makers (e.g. CFOs) who aren't talking to sales  
- We’ve noticed patterns – like fast-growing companies in a certain vertical using PostHog – and want to find lookalikes and nudge them  

We don’t need to wait for a hire to start this, but will probably bring someone on board once we've got it up and running to focus on this exclusively. Internal retargeting efforts (e.g. serving ads to users already in our product or org) fall under this umbrella too.

## Protecting the brand

Some dos and don'ts to make sure demand gen doesn't wreck the brand:

**We do:**

- Make it easy for users to sign up or book a demo  
- Keep copy, design, and creative as close to existing product page content as possible
- Measure ROI and iterate – but don’t obsess over attribution and spend, just get stuff out there first 
- Focus on growth of quality signups, not vanity metrics that don't convert to actual revenue

**We don’t:**

- Send cold outbound emails  
- Use 3rd party pixels or tracking scripts (we only use PostHog)  
- Gate product access or documentation  
- Retarget users by sending their personal data to 3rd party platforms 

## How we work

- Re-use assets. 90% of copy should come from the product or what's already been written.
- We don’t build design-heavy campaigns from scratch – we ask the design team for help only when it’s essential, but otherwise use our existing library of content.
- Generally don't outsource the creative thinking to the agency, use them more for execution and channel management. 
- Brian does the stuff, in collaboration with the agency, Charles acts as editor for now and/or vibe checks our approach.

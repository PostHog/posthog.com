We couldn't think of a better name for this team, so we just called it Words & Pictures. We aim to delight users through our art, our copy, our ads, and anything else that somehow falls into our remit. That can include anything from onboarding emails, to designing our merch, to posting ads, to planning product launches.

As a team we value being hands-on, putting human needs above internal processes, and sprinkling some chaos into everything we touch.

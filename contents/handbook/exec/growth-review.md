The Blitzscale team runs a monthly growth review, like most other teams. These reviews help build cross-team context, spot patterns early, and give us a chance to “see around corners” - whether that means being more ambitious for the next month or catching early signals we can troubleshoot. In this meeting, all individual team growth reviews are rolled up and discussed together. It acts as a safety net, helping us stay familiar with growth across the business and quickly course-correct when needed.

As always with growth reviews:

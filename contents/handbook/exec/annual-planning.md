This is the schedule for how we run various planning processes at PostHog throughout the year, together with explanations for what each thing is and who takes part. We intentionally keep things as light as possible, but have started introducing some slightly more structured processes around longer lead things like hiring and deciding [which products to build](/handbook/which-products). 

Besides _very_ high level financial forecasting, we don't plan out any further than 12 months, because things change and we don't want to feel locked into something that doesn't make sense. All 12 month plans are rolling, and we update them every three months at least. 

Changes to the plan can happen outside of this schedule - this is a rough guide, not a strict timetable.

The Content & Docs team has two core goals:

1. Increase awareness of PostHog, especially among people in our ideal customer profile
2. Help developers and PostHog users be more successful through great content and docs

We do this by:

- Building a reputation for world-class content
- Constantly working to improve our documentation
- Identifying where content can help users be more successful
- Holding a high bar for quality in everything we do
- Never being satisfied with how high that bar is
- Being weird, opinionated, and unafraid of being wrong
- Reacting quickly to opportunities whenever they arise
- Not being precious about our work and priorities
- Having a team of talented, technically literate writers (and Andy)
- Not relying on freelancers or guest contributors for content
- Avoiding tedious enterprise marketing nonsense (PDFs, gated content, webinars, etc.)

The latest goals for marketing can be found on the [Content & Docs team page](/teams/marketing).

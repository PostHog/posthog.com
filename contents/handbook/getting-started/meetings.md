We are [anti-meeting by default](/blog/meetings). 

However, while we default to [written and asynchronous communication](/handbook/company/communication), we find that having a few regular touch points for the whole team to come together on a call useful for sharing certain types of information, strengthening our culture and discussing more dynamic issues in real time. 

We keep these minimal in terms of time expectation - no more than 2hrs total per week. They are usually scheduled around 8.30am PDT/4.30pm GMT to allow people across multiple timezones to attend more easily. We default to cameras on — it’s nice to see real faces since we don’t get many in-person moments. If you need yours off, just give the team a quick heads-up why.ZZZZ

You should have been invited to any relevant meetings as part of your [onboarding](/handbook/people/onboarding). 

## Weekly schedule

- **Monday** - PostHog News all-hands meeting. Members of the team share company-wide updates about things like recruitment, product metrics and commercial performance - the doc is shared in the #general channel in Slack. We then go around and people are free to demo anything they've been working on recently. _The content of these meetings is always confidential._ All hands meetings are recorded too if you are out. Some teams also do sprint planning on a Monday. 
- **Tuesday** - Meeting-free - no regularly scheduled internal meetings allowed. [Learn more](#no-recurring-meeting-days-tuesdaysthursdays).
- **Wednesday** - some teams do sprint planning here as well. [Engineering tech talks/brown bags](/handbook/engineering/tech-talks) happen every second week, ClickHouse office hours happen on the alternate week. 
- **Thursday** - Meeting-free - no regularly scheduled internal meetings allowed. [Learn more](#no-recurring-meeting-days-tuesdaysthursdays).
- **Friday** - extracurricular type meetings like [BookHog](/handbook/people/clubs#clubs-at-posthog) often end up here!

## The all-hands

The Monday all-hands features a few regular sections and is recorded in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbA2W1CP2sA5vRVnS0UgyDgRz88mKpEVeinW6SYjO74/edit?usp=sharing).

- **Announcements:** Revenue and churn updates, plus other major news
- **Hiring:** Updates about headcount, who is starting soon, and new hiring roles
- **Acknowledgements:** Opportunity to give [kudos](/handbook/company/kudos) to your colleagues
- **Topic of the day:** [Exec team talks around a particular topic](/handbook/exec/all-hands-topics)
- **Q&A with James & Tim:** Ask the founders anything you want
- **Demos:** Show us what you've worked on last week

### No recurring meeting days (Tuesdays & Thursdays)

We try to keep these days focused on deep work. Therefore, we run no regularly scheduled meetings on these days.

However, speaking ad-hoc to your teammates on this day is fine - especially:

* new people shouldn't worry about following this rule for the first couple of weeks - it's more important you get up-to-speed quickly
* if it's obvious you need a meeting

If ad-hoc meetings are regularly happening, consider improving the agenda of another regular meeting so there isn't as much context switching in people's days. 

People in customer-facing roles where being on calls is a bigger part of your job don't need to stick to this as much, but please don't loop in engineers to customer calls on these days if you do by default. 

### Sprint planning

Each small team runs its own sprint planning meetings on whatever schedule you feel is most useful. Some teams do this on a Monday, others on a Wednesday, and sprints are usually 1-2 weeks long. We split into [Small Teams](/handbook/team-structure) for these. If a product team, your team's exec will also attend.

All sprint planning meetings are open to anyone to attend - if you are not a member of that small team, then we ask that you sit in as a non-speaking observer only.

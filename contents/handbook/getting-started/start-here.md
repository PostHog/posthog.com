## How we work

Now it's time to dive into some of the more practical stuff - these are the most important pages:

1. [Communication](/handbook/company/communication) - we have a distinctive style. If PostHog is your first all-remote company, this page is especially helpful.
2. [Team structure](/handbook/small-teams/team-structure) - we are structured in Small Teams. These pages will help you get the lay of the land, and who does what. 
3. [Management](/handbook/company/management) - we have a relatively unusual approach to management, and it is possible that you will not be familiar with our approach. 

### Working in GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog) for _everything_, including non-engineering task management. This might take some getting used to if you are non-technical. If that is the case, we have [this intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BB4Nkc0uVM) that will teach you the basics and [a detailed guide on how to set up a local version of Posthog.com so that you can make changes to the docs, handbook and website](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/developing-the-website). 

Our most active repositories (aka 'repos') are:

- [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) - main app
- [PostHog.com](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com) - website
- [Product Internal](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal) - product-related issues that need to be kept internal, e.g. security issues, customer-specific issues (private)
- [Company Internal](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal) - company-facing issues, e.g. internal processes, hiring planning (private)

When you have a new Issue or want to submit a Pull Request, you do that in the relevant repo. 

We use GitHub Projects to track the status of Issues in an easily viewable way. When you create an Issue, you can assign it to a Project - think of a Project as a way of organising and filtering Issues in a particular view. This makes it easy for Small Teams to easily track what they are working on without having to jump between different repos. Some Issues may be assigned to multiple Projects if they involve the work of more than one team.

You can also assign an Issue to a specific person, and tag it with a relevant label - use these to help people filter more easily.

Each Small Team has its own Project for tracking their Issues - [full list here](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects). Most teams run two week sprints - as part of onboarding, you will be invited to the relevant planning meetings.

## Getting yourself up and running - your first week

If you're new, the default goal is to be able to get work done autonomously.

This will require:

* You know how to ship things in our environment and with your equipment
* You get to know your team and have a sense of who can QA your work
* You get what the company and your small team care about and needs to get done, so you can prioritize appropriately

Everything else is a means to this end! We often do onboarding in person to accelerate all of the above. This usually takes around a week.

## General etiquette

### Don't assign issues to people

You can list and categorize issues

If you want someone to see an issue, @mention them and/or Slack them the link.

### Don't yolo merge

Do not "yolo merge" ie force a change to our website or platform without someone else checking it. This should _only_ happen in emergencies, _even_ for simple changes. It is _so_ frequent that we find issues. If you have _any_ doubt, get someone else to look at it first.

### PRs > issues > Slack

Bias for impact. If you can just pick up the work, do so. We want a culture of individual contribution _not_ of delegation.

It is fine (and encouraged) to pick up side quests or to deviate from your goals if you think you should. Especially if someone is a quick fix, do it yourself as part of our value - that everyone codes.

If you aren't able to make a change yourself, create an issue in GitHub. Avoid assigning todos in Slack as a means of getting someone to pick up a task. It's hard to track and easy to forget.

### Do things as publicly as possible by default

For discussions, public repos are the best place. Then private ones, then Slack public channels, then Slack private channels or DMs. This is part of our "We are open source" value, and helps with general context setting for the wider team, which means everyone can work more autonomously.

There are only a few exceptions to what we can't share publicly, for example if you are discussing security concerns, specific customers (for privacy reasons), revenue or growth numbers (since these cause signalling issues with investors or competitors).

Internally, _everything_ can be shared apart from people issues - such as HR / personal (ie recruitment or health data).

### Be proactive with community questions

Don't _only_ help the community when you're the person on support hero in your small team. No matter what your goals may be, if you can quickly ship fixes to real life user problems, then you are going to build goodwill, word of mouth growth, and a better product all in one swoop.

You can find these in [posthog.com/questions](https://posthog.com/questions).

## Longer term - values

You can't go too wrong if you follow these values:

### 1. We are open source

Building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to [PostHog's strategy](/handbook/what-is-posthog).

We default to transparency with everything we work on. That means we make public our handbook, [our roadmap](/handbook/strategy/roadmap), [how we pay](/handbook/people/compensation) (or even [let go of](/handbook/people/offboarding)) people, [what our strategy is](/handbook/what-is-posthog), and [who we have raised money from](/handbook/strategy/investors). Internally, we go even further - providing financial information, live updates on fundraising, and board slide access.

This enables the strongest community growth possible. It causes the core team to raise the bar on their work, it provides the context needed for people to work across multiple timezones, and it enables a deep work-heavy and meeting-light culture. It creates trust.

### 2. We haven't built our defining feature yet

Ideas are fragile. Be direct but encouraging when you encounter new ideas. If we default to providing negative criticism of new ideas, then they'll simply stop coming. Instead, default to "yes and" rather than "no but", before rejecting an idea.

We should never stop iterating. You learn faster and help PostHog perform better by getting what you're working on into the real world. We expect you to ship new designs, features, or whatever is needed for your role in tiny chunks, frequently, and often before you feel ready.

### 3. Everyone codes

...although this doesn't mean everyone has to be a software developer, and not everyone needs experience in this before they join. Our platform's adoption starts with developers using our open source project so we use GitHub to share most of our work publicly and to build a large community of technical users.

No matter your role, being able to use the basics of GitHub helps you understand our audience. Beyond that, we'll encourage you to build your technical skill, rather than delegating more challenging tasks to others, so you become a more effective contributor.

### 4. Trust and feedback over process

There are two ways to scale - trust and feedback, or process. We choose the former because we're building a wide platform with many products, so autonomy is more important than control. We hire people that work well with high level direction and will step on toes if needed to get things done.

When giving / receiving feedback, we assume positive intentions and focus on giving specific examples. Many of our team's peak experiences at PostHog have been receiving direct feedback. Feedback should be acknowledged, but what you do with it is up to you - no one built anything great by committee.

We expect you to pick out the very most important thing you can think of, and work on that. Discard plans as you see fit.

We judge your performance based on the impact you deliver overall, no matter what your role.

### 5. Bias for impact

Proactive people are the most successful at PostHog. Prioritize hard and make sure you focus your energy on what's most valuable of our customers / company then take ownership of making it happen.

Today, across many product areas, we deliver the most impact when we move fast and maintain a high quality bar. It improves retention and accelerates word of mouth growth.

In engineering, this means that bias for impact is likely to mean putting more effort into prioritization, scoping out the problem and designing before implementation. It doesn't mean we aim to spend weeks in slow feedback loops. Instead, we get together and focus all our energy on rapidly understanding the problem and solution upfront. Solving a small customer support issue super-quickly to delight them is also highly impactful since we know this is a strong contributor to our word of mouth growth.

For other areas of PostHog this is likely to involve prioritizing and focusing our efforts on bigger bets which we believe can have an outsided impact (e.g. increasing sign-ups, getting a new large enterprise to start paying, increasing our rank on google, etc.)

### 6. Talent compounds

Getting into PostHog is a huge challenge. Once you're here, it stays that way. We are *extremely* demanding of performance.

In return, you get to work with others producing the best work of their careers.

We are a team, not a family. This means we have very ambitious goals, [compensate](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation#how-it-works) generously and transparently, offer [exceptional benefits](/handbook/people/benefits), and do everything we can to provide an environment for you to do your best work. Often this means everyone, [especially managers](/handbook/company/management), getting out of your way. It's also [not ok to let your teammates fail](/handbook/company/culture/#dont-let-others-fail). We expect everyone to provide direct feedback to help everyone perform at their best. We pay [generous severance](/handbook/people/compensation#severance) if things aren't working out.

## Lore of PostHog / in jokes

A beginner's guide to the Slack emoji and various anecdotes you'll see and hear about.

* :yakko-internet: Yakko always had bad internet when demoing. _Always_.
* Jams wore a skin tight green all-body suit for months to improve his zoom background game without us realizing.
* :ben-peace: Ben has the same pose in 90% of PostHog photos. It's a reference to a meme.
* :hype-X: / :X-hype: where X is a team member. Used in times of extremely impressive performance, unless used sarcastically.
* Mr Blobby. We once changed how we ingest session recording data, to use s3 blob storage. We called it Mr Blobby. [Mr Blobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Blobby) is a creepy '90s TV character from the UK. This project was nightmarishly hard, which is why this character was fitting.
* Paul will make you eat Gelato at every offsite.
* Sometimes people screenshot each other's faces and zoom screens and use them as their backgrounds. Usually when an all hands is too dry.
* Charles wore a suit to his performance review. He is the only person in history to wear a suit to anything PostHog related. Unsure if he was making a point, we later abandoned the practice of performance reviews regardless.
* We got lots of buses at an offsite in Portugal. It was incredibly twisty, the driver was in a bad mood, drove too quickly and people threw up. It was bad.
* :spark_joy: / :does_not_spark_joy: a reference to [Marie Kondo's book](https://konmari.com/marie-kondo-rules-of-tidying-sparks-joy/) on tidying your house, generally used to describe things that are particularly good or bad from a user's perspective
* :eu-thumbsup: we once made [isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com](https://www.isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com/) when there were privacy rulings about Google Analytics. We put it on HN, got the top of the front page and it was our biggest _ever_ day of signups at the time. The website was supposed to be tongue in cheek but the internet took it seriously. The person in the emoji is Ursula von der Leyen who introduced the GDPR legislation.
* IPO promises. There is a list of these that is brought out at certain moments. You may see.
* Marius will train you on Post It notes if you go to an offsite with him. Success of a good post it note posting is in the lift away from the pack - the most important thing is to peel, as opposed to pulling, the post it note off.
* Three finger rule - another Marius invention, if someone holds up three fingers whilst you're talking, it means you aren't being concise enough. We don't actually use this much as it's predictably awkward and distracting so ruins any meeting it could have otherwise helped.

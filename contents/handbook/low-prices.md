We want our customers to spend their money on their engineering team, not on buying ten software products.

Here is the list of advantages we have and why they matter.

## We can sell multiple products to the same people

So, do you want to buy ten products for $1k each or all ten for $5k? Or, better yet, each one separately?

We can pull this off because we're focused on getting in first – we don't follow the whims of whatever an enterprise may have.

## No sales needed

Our competitors spend more on sales and marketing than product development. Nearly all our sales are self-serve _and_ 70% of our customers find us through word-of-mouth growth.

## Multiple products, one dataset

We aim to be the source of truth for customer and product data. The products we build all work from this same dataset, instead of ten different vendors all paying to store the same data as each other – each with their own platform teams.

## A technical audience who need _docs_, not technical support

Many of our products are traditionally sold to non-technical people. They need more help setting up SDKs or snippets. We work with engineers who simply need good docs. Writing and maintaining those (and an open-source codebase that people can inspect or even fix bugs in themselves) saves thousands of support questions each year.

## Using open-source technology

We've often had second-mover advantages.

One of these is that we could use the latest open-source technologies, like ClickHouse. Many of our competitors have had to build their own databases. You can guess which is more efficient for storing tens of billions of events and serving millions of analytics queries. Better them than us!

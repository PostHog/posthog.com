Our newsletter is called Product for Engineers. It's owned by [Ian](/community/profiles/29296). 

The newsletter is long-form, original posts about building successful products and startups for product engineers and founders. It's one of our top-performing marketing channels, so we invest a lot of effort in it and keep the quality bar for it high.

We currently publish biweekly. The content in the newsletter is not directly tied to PostHog, even if the branding is. Topics should be able to stand alone; it is NOT just a surface for marketing our products.

## How to write a good newsletter

These aren’t rules, just things that have worked well in the past. They provide some guidance on writing a successful newsletter.

### Topic

- **Write about ideas, practices, and experiences unique to PostHog.** Challenge conventional wisdom (ChatGPT is good for discovering what “conventional” is). For example, “[Product management is broken. Engineers can fix it](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/product-management-is-broken-engineers)” goes against standard practice and details the way product management works at PostHog.

- **Help our audience directly.** Our audience is engineers, founders, aspiring founders. Helping them [get a job](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-to-get-a-job-at-a-startup) or [launch a startup](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-we-got-our-first-1000-users) works well. [Buying software](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-software-salespeople-screw-you), less so.

- **Let the examples guide you.** It’s ideal to have strong examples in mind before you start. These can be from PostHog (like [How we got our first 1,000 users](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-we-got-our-first-1000-users)) or from similar companies (like Doist, Gitlab, and Zapier in [Habits of effective remote teams](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/habits-of-effective-remote-teams)). It’s easy to say things, examples prove them.

### Title

- **The title is the frame for the entire piece.** It is worth spending more effort on upfront. Come up with multiple options and get feedback on them if you can.

- **Some title formats that have worked well:**
    - Non-obvious lessons / advice [about topic]
    - Mistakes to avoid [doing a thing]
    - WTF is (thing) and why should you care?
    - How to think like (person)
    - The magic of (thing)
    - What we learned about (blah) when doing (blah)
    - What nobody tells you about (thing)
    - X things we've learned about (thing)

- **Be bold and direct.** Address common questions. Focus on a specific role (engineers, founders). In retrospect, “[Using your own product is a superpower](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/using-your-own-product-is-a-superpower)” is too boring and generic. Less is better: Gmail on mobile truncates titles at 35-40 characters.

- **Get readers curious to learn more.** Highlight a gap between where readers are and where they want to be. Hint at exclusive or non-obvious information.

### Intro

- **Why trust us to write about this?** We can [write about hiring](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-to-get-a-job-at-a-startup) because 900 people applied in the last two months. We can [write about A/B testing](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/ab-testing-mistakes-i-learned-the) because Lior has run hundreds of them. Build credibility.

- **Use a counterintuitive take as a hook.** If you’re writing about something we do differently than others, the intro is a great place to start. [For example](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/product-management-is-broken-engineers): "When Tim and I first started PostHog in 2020, I was adamant we would never hire a product manager."

- **Clarify what the reader will get out of it.** A playbook, framework, lessons learned, pitfalls to avoid. Better yet, what’s the benefit to them? More sales, a job, product-market fit?

### Structure

- **Headings, lists, and numbers are your friend.** These help readers know where they are and create a sense of progress. 2, 3, 5, 7 are all a good number of points to aim for. 4 and 6 are awkward.

- **Use takeaways.** Help readers implement the ideas themselves. This makes posts more actionable. [Non-obvious behaviors that will kill your startup](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/non-obvious-behaviors-that-will-kill) does a good job of this.

- **Use pattern breakers.** Walls of text are hard to read. Make graphics in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). Use hedgehogs. Add screenshots and quote blocks. Get more visually skilled people to help you if you need. Use these at the beginning and/or end of sections.

- **Go deeper.** Longer newsletters let us fully explore a concept. [How we choose technologies](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-we-choose-technologies) ended up being ~1750 words and [Product management is broken. Engineers can fix it](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/product-management-is-broken-engineers) was ~1900.

### Style & tone

- **Think about rhythm:** Two long paragraphs back-to-back is tiring, so is back-to-back sections with three paragraphs each. Use bullet points, quotes, and visuals to break things up where needed, and mix short, clear sentences with longer ones, so the pace doesn't become monotonous. 

- **Break up very hard to read sentences:** Use a tool like [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to identify sections that are very hard to read. Some long sentences aren't bad, but lots of them consecutively will drain the reader's attention. Aim for a readability grade of 8 or less.

- **Use footnotes tactically:** They're useful for adding context that's useful, but not important enough to bog down your core narrative. If something is hard to explain and slowing things down, consider using a footnote. They're also a fun way to add jokes, rants, easter eggs, and references.

- **Be opinionated:** Sitting on the fence isn't interesting. It's ok for people to disagree with you, so avoid too much hedging.

- **Use graphics and charts:** These are great ways for explaining complex ideas and make for great social content. Create a bad version and ask <TeamMember name="Daniel Hawkins" photo /> to help you make it better.

- **Be fun and lighthearted:** We're writing about building software, not internet safety. Throw in jokes and memes occasionally. Again, footnotes and captions can be useful here.

- **But use memes sparingly:** Too many memes can become overwhelming and a distraction. One per article is probably enough – two if they're really good, or the article is on the long / serious side.

- **Address the reader directly:** Say this "this will help you" rather than "this will help your company" or "this will help people". You're talking to one person, not a collective.

## What publishing a newsletter looks like

This is a common, but not strict, process for publishing a newsletter. It's not a checklist you must follow, but it's a good starting point.

### Part 1: Come up with an idea

There are a few common ways we source [good content ideas](#topic):

- **[#content-and-video-ideas](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C015CRUQR7Y)**: A place for anyone and everyone at PostHog to post newsletter ideas (and beyond). Ideas that get others excited here are promising.

- **Reader polls**: We run polls in the newsletter asking what readers want to read next. We compile and maintain the [results](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/10212) as a list of potential topics for anyone to pick up.

- **Old blogs**: Newsletters are often based on blogs we already wrote, converted into a newsletter-y format. We still always try to add a twist to make the content fresh.

### Part 2: Form an opinion

This sounds obvious, but we mean it. 

Once you've picked a topic, you should have at least one strong opinion or hypothesis. Product for Engineers thrives because we are opinionated; fence-sitting isn't interesting.

This opinion becomes the angle of the article and the starting point for your research in Part 3.

### Part 3: Gather concrete examples

The secret sauce behind our newsletters is that we always ground our "hot takes" in concrete examples, either from (A) observed data or (B) lived experience.

#### Observed data

Research observable, real-world data related to the topic.

- What do other high-growth startups do? 
- What are examples and stories from them?
- What are the opinions of experts in the space?
- What's the conventional wisdom for the topic?

Compare what you find with your original opinion. As you immerse yourself, refine the narrative and angle of the piece.

This is really important if you are NOT already an expert on the topic. Why should the reader listen to your opinion on it? Readers might trust a backend engineer to tell them about optimizing database queries, but a marketer has a harder time convincing them.

You don't have to come up with a whole dissertation, but you really need to do _some_ research before outlining. These examples are literally the foundation of the piece and will inform everything else like the headline, structure, and hook.

For example, if you're writing an article about how to write great job posts, search for real job posts and develop a sense of what makes one good or bad. Look for patterns and themes. Save examples.

#### Lived experience

Another category of examples is lived experience, but this really only works if you have legitimate authority to speak on the topic. James can pull from his experience founding a successful startup, but someone who hasn't done it might sound like they're making it up.

We have several newsletters and blogs by execs who introduce the piece by saying "I worked on this for X years and increased Y metric, here's what I learned". That's the source of their authority on the topic.

"Here's what we (as PostHog) have learned about X" also works well, but requires a bit more research. Past blogs, pull requests, requests for comments, and even Slack conversations can all be sources of information. Include these directly in your post when you can.

### Part 4: Create a content idea issue on GitHub

If you're already certain that this topic is a hit, you don't have to do this part.

1. Create a new issue in the `posthog.com` GitHub repo using the **content idea** template to pitch and outline the piece. [Here's an example.](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/13436).

1. Include a few [titles](#title) or headline options. 

1. Write up an outline. 
    - You can format it how you want, but remember that people are reading this async. It should be more formal than a braindump, but no need for full sentences and paragraphs.
    - This is a good time to work on the [structure](#structure) of the article. Getting this right will save you a lot of time later.

1. Request feedback from <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" photo /> by either tagging him in the issue or posting in [#team-editorial](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C09GU689J1X).

1. This is also a good time to request feedback from specific individuals or teams of interest. For example, if you're writing a piece like "WTF do support engineers do?", it would be a shame not to collect their thoughts on the topic.

### Part 5: Write your draft and get feedback

Congrats, it's time to start actually writing! (Revisit [How to write a good newsletter](#how-to-write-a-good-newsletter) for style and writing tips).

This part starts independently. It is up to you to write the draft. This means you can use whatever writing tool you feel comfortable with. Use Microsoft Word if you really want.

When you've got a polished first draft, it's time to get feedback.

This is one of the few times where we don't collaborate on GitHub. This is because we want the content preview to look like a Substack article, so we use a customized template to mimic this format.

1. Create a copy of this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJzajW3Xi84EgGffDlbzBmZpBReoMht_fy7Z7S7dZhM/edit?tab=t.0).

1. Add your draft to the document and make sure it looks like a Substack article.
    - Include sketches, descriptions, or samples of graphics that you plan to use in this stage (e.g., diagrams, memes, charts). 
    - For diagrams, we often use Figma or FigJam to create our own, and then submit an [art request](/handbook/brand/art-requests) to polish it later.
    - For artwork like hero images or hedgehogs, you can include a description or a sketch or AI-generated artifact to communicate the concept. 

1. Request feedback from Ian or Jina by tagging them in your issue or posting in [#team-editorial](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C09GU689J1X).

1. Iterate back and forth a few times.

### Part 6: Request visuals

Visuals are a core part of newsletters. They help explain complex ideas, make our content more engaging, showcase our brand, and spark joy.

Some examples of visuals we've used are in the <PrivateLink url="https://www.figma.com/file/3wxLXDQ87KfHoEl1lBx4OW?node-id=110-92&t=0GBwwtVev9yE2bwP-0&type=design&mode=design&fuid=1157334514091835431">Newsletter Graphics</PrivateLink>, <PrivateLink url="https://www.figma.com/board/b0ttECQMiQ6LlGKpIICUcM/Marketing-Jam?node-id=0-1&t=xhcaGewTjRCsvGHB-0">Marketing Jam</PrivateLink>, and <PrivateLink url="https://www.figma.com/design/I0VKEEjbkKUDSVzFus2Lpu/Hoggies?node-id=1-196&t=UZQMXMddH0DMLxqX-0">Hoggies</PrivateLink> boards.

Once you're confident with the visuals, you can submit [art requests](/handbook/brand/art-requests) to get them done properly. Try to do this **at least 1 week before you need them**. There are two types of art requests for the newsletter:

1. **Hero image**: The hero image AKA thumbnail or preview image. It needs to be 1920x1080 px for the `posthog.com` OG image and 1456x1048 px for the Substack preview image. [Here's an example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/13987).

2. **Polish**: This is for things like diagrams and visuals you created in FigJam, etc. Include a link to those. [Here's an example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/13768).

### Part 7: Export to Substack

Once you've worked with an editor to polish your post, it's time to add it to Substack. There are a few more sections to add at this stage:

- **More good reads**: External blogs and articles you enjoyed recently. They can be things you found while researching, or other PostHog blogs. They don't have to be related to the newsletter topic itself. Channels like #dev, #devel, and #industry-news are also good sources of inspiration here.

- **Reader polls**: If it doesn't hurt the flow of the piece, add a poll for future newsletter topics. You can find subjects to poll in [our newsletter planning issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/10212). After a week, add the results to that same issue.

- **Job posts**: Ask in <PrivateLink url="https://app.slack.com/client/TSS5W8YQZ/C09FJ89FVCK">#team-talent</PrivateLink> what 5 jobs to include in the newsletter.

After adding these, you can add the final touches like:

- Check for formatting mistakes
- Minor line edits, typos, etc.
- Double check all images and assets work
- Make sure all links work
- For any `posthog.com` links, include UTMs like `?utm_source=posthog-newsletter&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=enter_name_here`.
- Fill in Substack-specific fields in settings including the title, description, and hero image. We don't worry about SEO for newsletters so you can just reuse the title/description.

Send a test email to yourself to make sure it all looks good. You can configure a couple of titles to A/B test.

Lastly, schedule to publish. We usually publish Mondays at ~11AM PST/ 7PM GMT. Your creation is now live and reaching thousands of inboxes around the world. No pressure.

### Part 8: Create a GitHub PR

After publishing on Substack, we still do a final GitHub PR to `posthog.com`.

1. Create a PR on GitHub, formatted to fit the site (like [uploading images](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/assets))
1. Request a quick review from a peer for glaring mistakes
1. Merge!

## Growth and distribution

Beyond organic growth, we grow the newsletter by writing social posts about it.

In the past, we [ran ads to drive subscriptions](/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship), but have paused this for now.

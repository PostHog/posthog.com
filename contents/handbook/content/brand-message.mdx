## What should we be trying to communicate about PostHog? 

PostHog is a developer platform that helps engineers build successful products. We provide a suite of dev tools to help them do this.

Beyond literally communicating what PostHog is and what it does, we want to help developers build successful products. We do this by communicating the following:

- There is a lot of hard-earned knowledge in the startup and product space that engineers don't know yet because it's not written for them. We've also learned a lot from building PostHog and from our customers. We want to share all this with them.

- We provide all the tools engineers need to build successful products. All of them are powerful, but require expertise to use effectively. Some engineers don't even know these tools exist. We help engineers build this expertise by providing world-class docs, tutorials, and technical content.

- Engineers can build successful products. They don't need product managers or data analysts to tell them what to build. They are capable of making product decisions themselves, but need the right tools and knowledge to help them do so.

- Talking to users, shipping what they want fast, fixing issues, measuring impact, and iterating is the core loop of building successful products.

- PostHog aims to do "the right thing." We're self-serve with usage-based pricing. We don't have loss leaders. We don't do sleazy marketing or sales tactics. We're open source and transparent. We advocate for "the right thing" and help teach engineers to fight back against the opposite.

## Who is our audience?

Ideally, [our ICP](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for): product engineers (full-stack engineers skewed towards the frontend) building the most-loved products at high-growth startups.

An important subset of these people are technical founders. Great product engineers sort of act like technical founders anyway.

## Why do developers, product engineers, and technical founders pick PostHog?

We help them debug and ship their product faster.

- The first part we do with automated error tracking and session replays, both of which let them discover and understand issues and their context.

- The second part we do with feature flags to rollout new features, experimentation to measure impact, and surveys to get feedback.

- As a bonus, we combine all this with product, web, and LLM analytics.

We have all the apps in one. This means less time spent patching these tools together and paying for them all separately. When engineers need a new tool, they can just use PostHog.

Our team is technical and speaks engineers' language. Our engineers talk with customers to figure out what to build. Our support team are all former engineers and get into the nitty-gritty of issues. Our sales and CS teams are very technical too. They focus more on your use cases and implementation than steak dinners.

We want engineers to self-serve. They can sign up and use all of the features of PostHog for free. We also work hard to have world-class docs and technical content that enables them to solve their own problems.

## Things PostHog is not

PostHog could be a lot of things. We also have a lot of terms for the same things. This creates cognitive load and confusion. We'd rather readers use their energy elsewhere. To help them, avoid the following:

1. We are not an analytics platform or tool. Although we started with analytics, we have grown well beyond this. We're not a product analytics or session replay tool either.

2. We are not a dev tool platform. This makes it seem like we are just dev tools to use.

3. We are not a collection, group, set, bunch or any other collective noun of tools or products. We are not “product and data tools” as this isn't developer-focused enough. Product and data should refer to our customer's products and data.

4. It's not “product analytics product”, it's “product analytics app” or just “product analytics” whenever possible.

5. We are not focused on product managers, data analysts, marketers, or other non-engineer roles. PostHog is usable for them, but we focus on engineers first. More people than you think are engineers too, especially thanks to AI coding tools and automation platforms.

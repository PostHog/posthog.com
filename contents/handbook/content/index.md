The Content team has two core goals:

1. Increase awareness of PostHog, especially among people in our ideal customer profile
2. Help developers and PostHog users be more successful through great content, videos, and docs

We do this by:

- Building a reputation for world-class content
- Constantly working to improve our documentation
- Identifying where content can help users be more successful
- Holding a high bar for quality in everything we do
- Never being satisfied with how high that bar is
- Being weird, opinionated, and unafraid of being wrong
- Reacting quickly to opportunities whenever they arise
- Not being precious about our work and priorities
- Having a team of talented, technically literate writers (and Andy)
- Not relying on freelancers or guest contributors for content
- Avoiding tedious enterprise marketing nonsense (PDFs, gated content, webinars, etc.)

Content is the main pillar of our marketing strategy. Our strategy is to go _deeper_ and create better content as we grow. We don't rely on AI. We don't take content in exchange for links. We don't have arbitrary volume goals.

Our latest goals can be found on the [content team page](/teams/content). You can share ad-hoc ideas in our [#content-ideas Slack channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C015CRUQR7Y).

## Who is our audience?

It should be the same as [who we are building for](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for). Specifically:

- **Product engineers:** Software engineers who want to improve their product skills, understand users, and build successful new products.

- **Founders:** Technical and non-technical founders seeking advice on how to run a successful startup.

- **PostHog users:** Existing PostHog users who want to develop their skills and learn how to get the most out of PostHog.

- **B2B SaaS companies:** Our ideal customers are B2B SaaS companies who need reliable user data and a simplified data stack. Most of our output is tailored toward B2B use cases.

## What kind of content do we produce?

1. **Opinionated advice:** Articles where we offer a strong point of view on a topic that impacts our audience. Examples include [The Product-Market Fit Game](/founders/product-market-fit-game), [Burning money on paid ads for a dev tool](/founders/dev-marketing-paid-ads), and [How to design your company for speed](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-to-design-your-company-for-speed) 

2. **High intent SEO comparisons:** Articles for people actively considering PostHog, or searching for a product like ours. Examples include comparisons between [PostHog and competing products](/blog/tags/comparisons), guides on the [best alternatives to popular tools](/blog/best-heap-alternatives), and guides to [most popular tools in our segments](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

3. **Helpful evergreen guides:** Articles on topics of interest to our users and potential users. They generally target popular search terms. Examples include [How to measure product-market fit](/founders/measure-product-market-fit), [The AARRR pirate funnel explained](/product-engineers/aarrr-pirate-funnel), and [8 annoying A/B testing mistakes every engineer should know](/product-engineers/ab-testing-mistakes).

4. **Engineering tutorials:** Guides on how to do specific things in PostHog. These can be for existing PostHog users, or aimed at potential users who are trying to solve a specific problem. Some, like [How to set up Python A/B testing](/tutorials/python-ab-testing) are SEO focused. Others focus on specific PostHog user pain points.

5. **Newsletters:** Our [newsletter](/handbook/content/newsletter), [Product for Engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com), is both a distribution channel and its own content category. Issues often curate or summarize our existing content, or that of others, into an easy-to-digest, snackable format.

## How we work

We work autonomously. You don't need permission or approval to write something or make a change. You're the driver.

It is often helpful to share ideas in our [#content-ideas Slack channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C015CRUQR7Y) or as [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new?template=content-idea-template.md). The GitHub issue template provides a structure to help you think through your idea.

You can ask for feedback whenever, but it's often better when it's:

1. Clear what feedback you're looking for. Ask if specific points or examples work, how you could word something better, where do you get bored, etc.
2. You have something solid to give feedback on. Again, pull requests are better than issues.

For specific details about writing, see our [style guide](/handbook/content/posthog-style-guide). When you're ready to get writing reviewed, create a pull request for your Markdown file(s) (`*.md` or `*.mdx`) in the [posthog.com repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com). See [developing the website](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/developing-the-website) for more.

Once you've gone through the pull request checklist and got an approval from the relevant person on the content team, you're ready to merge (aka publish).

## Content distribution

So you've written a great piece of content. Now what? Here are various ways to spread the word:

### 1. SEO

If we can capture search traffic, we should try to do it. Start by identifying the keywords most relevant to your article, and aim for a mix of short-tail terms (broad, high-volume) and long-tail ones (specific, lower-volume but higher intent). Use them naturally throughout the piece – especially in headings, intros, and anchor text – and make sure your target keyword appears in the meta title and meta description.

Good SEO doesn’t just help your content rank in search, it also improves your chances of being cited by LLMs (aka AEO).

Follow our [SEO best practices guide](/handbook/content/seo-guide) for more on structure, formatting, and linking.

### 2. LinkedIn

Share a post using either your own account or the company account, but note that the company account will have dramatically less reach than your personal one. To post using the company account, use [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) (ask <TeamMember name="Andy Vandervell" /> to add you to it if you don't have access).

Tips for writing a good post:

- The **image** is really what makes or breaks a post. Ideally, it should standalone. [Graphics](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andyvandervell_in-the-last-two-months-weve-had-900-people-activity-7231695253437661186-j5hg) and [memes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andyvandervell_whats-the-difference-between-a-software-activity-7245386804491620355-4dR6) work well.

  - If you are posting a changelog update, you can create nice images when clicking **Add entry** in the [changelog](/changelog/). It's under the **Social sharing** header.

- Don't just share the link. Write out an intriguing summary or introduction of the post. Here's a [good example](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257340218159116289). Make sure to include an image or the link will be downranked by LinkedIn's algorithm.

- Keep the link in the main post, and don't do that annoying thing of saying "link is in the comments".

- Make a bold first sentence, even if it takes more words to do it. LinkedIn truncates posts so readers need to click `...more` to see the rest after 250 characters. A blank new line counts as ~150 characters.

- Lists like [this one](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andyvandervell_at-many-companies-product-management-looks-activity-7270439313199226881-MH4z) work well.

- Some people to look to for inspiration: [Andy Vandervell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyvandervell/), [Jordan Cutler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordancutler1), [Ashish Pratap Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishps1/)

### 3. Twitter / X

Again, use Buffer to post from the company account.

Tips for writing a good post:

- Write a brief summary of the post while sharing as much content as possible in it. [Good example](https://x.com/posthog/status/1851571551314825375).

- Attach an image to the post (don't rely on the link's social graph preview). Again, you can use **Add entry** in the [changelog](/changelog/) to create a nice image.

- Do your best not to sound "corporate" or serious. Authenticity is appreciated on Twitter. Have fun with it!

### 4. Share internally

Internal teams, especially sales, CS, and the relevant product team, can often make use of the content you write if they know about it. They can share it with customers and use the ideas and examples in their conversations. 

It's worth sharing in their Slack channels directly as they don't see everything we publish. Asking them to smash the like button, subscribe, and share with their friends and family is a good tactic too.

### 5. Paid ads + newsletters

You can promote your post by buying sponsored slots in newsletters. <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" /> has a list of newsletters and booked slots we can use to promote content. See [sponsorships](/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship) for more.

If you want to run a paid ad campaign on Reddit, Google, or Twitter, see the [paid ads page](/handbook/growth/marketing/paid-ads).

It's a good idea to create an issue highlighting what you'd like to achieve in your campaign. Here's an [example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/9646)

We've built out extensive tooling to help us write docs. This page records how these tools work and how to use them.

## Onboarding docs

Onboarding docs are special because these instructions are **shared** between the [in-app onboarding](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding) flow and the getting started pages on the [posthog.com website](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com). These are the first pieces of docs a new user will see, so they need to be up to date and accurate. 

To help keep in-app and website onboarding docs in sync, there is a **single source** of truth for the onboarding docs in the [`posthog/posthog`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) repository under the [`docs/onboarding`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding) directory. This means you only need to update the in-app onboarding docs in the `posthog/posthog` repository, and the website docs will be updated automatically.

### Which products have shared onboarding docs

This is a relatively new feature, so we're still migrating old onboarding docs to the new system. As of December 2025:

| Product | Status |
|---------|--------|
| LLM analytics | ✅ Migrated |
| Product analytics | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Web analytics | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Session replay | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Feature flags | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Experiments | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Error tracking | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Surveys | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Data pipelines | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Data warehouse | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Revenue analytics | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| PostHog AI | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Workflows | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Logs | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Endpoints | ⏳ Not yet migrated | 

### How to update onboarding docs

1. Find the shared content file in the [`posthog/posthog`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) repository under [`docs/onboarding`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding). For example, `docs/onboarding/llm-analytics/openai.tsx`.
2. Edit the `.tsx` file directly in the `posthog/posthog` repository. Make your changes to the component.
3. Test locally by running the app in development mode and verifying the changes in the in-app onboarding. You can trigger onboarding by navigating to `localhost:8010/products`.
4. Commit and open a PR to merge your changes into `master` in `posthog/posthog`. This will trigger a Vercel preview build of the website. Verify these changes and merge the PR.
5. If you need more confidence, verify the website locally by setting the `GATSBY_POSTHOG_BRANCH` environment variable to your PR branch and rebuilding the website locally.
6. Verify on website: The website will automatically pull the changes on its next build.

### How to create/migrate onboarding docs

**Step 1: Create the shared component in `posthog/posthog`**

1. Navigate to the product directory in `docs/onboarding/`. If it doesn't exist, create it (e.g., `docs/onboarding/your-product/`).
2. Create a new `.tsx` file (e.g., `docs/onboarding/your-product/filename.tsx`).
3. Export a named component that contains your onboarding content. Use the `useMDXComponents` hook to access shared components:

```tsx file=docs/onboarding/llm-analytics/google.tsx
import { useMDXComponents } from 'scenes/onboarding/OnboardingDocsContentWrapper'

export const GoogleInstallation = (): JSX.Element => {
    const {
        Steps,
        Step,
        CodeBlock,
        CalloutBox,
        ProductScreenshot,
        OSButton,
        Markdown,
        Blockquote,
        dedent,
        snippets,
    } = useMDXComponents()
    
    const NotableGenerationProperties = snippets?.NotableGenerationProperties
    return (
        <Steps>
            <Step title="Install the PostHog SDK" badge="required">
                <Markdown>
                    Setting up analytics starts with installing the PostHog SDK for your language. LLM analytics works best with our Python and Node SDKs.
                </Markdown>

                <CodeBlock
                    blocks={[
                        {
                            language: 'bash',
                            file: 'Python',
                            code: dedent`
                                pip install posthog
                            `,
                        },
                        {
                            language: 'bash',
                            file: 'Node',
                            code: dedent`
                                npm install @posthog/ai posthog-node
                            `,
                        },
                    ]}
                />
            </Step>
            {/* ... more steps ... */}
    </Steps>
    )
}
```

4. For reusable snippets, create them in `docs/onboarding/<product>/_snippets/` (e.g., `docs/onboarding/your-product/_snippets/example-snippet.tsx`). Export a named component.
5. Create or update a scene in the `posthog/posthog` repository to import and use your new component. See [example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/sdks/llm-analytics/LLMAnalyticsSDKInstructions.tsx).
6. Test in the app by updating the in-app onboarding scene to import and use your new component. See [example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/sdks/llm-analytics/8LMAnalyticsSDKInstructions.tsx).
7. Reference existing examples in [`docs/onboarding/llm-analytics`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding/llm-analytics) for patterns.

**Step 2: Create the website stub in `posthog/posthog.com`**

1. Run a build to pull the latest from `posthog/posthog` with the `GATSBY_POSTHOG_BRANCH` environment variable set to your PR branch:
   ```bash
   pnpm clean && pnpm && GATSBY_POSTHOG_BRANCH=<your-pr-branch> pnpm start
   ```
   This will fetch the shared content into `.cache/gatsby-source-git/posthog-main-repo/docs/onboarding/`.

2. Create the MDX stub file in the appropriate docs location:
   - For installation pages: `contents/docs/<product>/installation/<name>.mdx`
   - For other pages: `contents/docs/<product>/<path>.mdx`
   - Example: `contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/openai.mdx`

3. Add frontmatter with title, `tableOfContents`, etc.:

```mdx
---
title: Your Product Installation
showStepsToc: true
tableOfContents: [
    {
        url: 'step-1',
        value: 'Step 1 title',
        depth: 1,
    },
]
---
```

4. Add the source comment at the top (after frontmatter) to track the source of the content:

```html
<!--
This page imports shared onboarding content from the main PostHog repo.
Source: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/docs/onboarding/your-product/installation.tsx
See the docs runbook for more info: https://posthog.com/handbook/content/docs-runbook
-->
```

5. Import and render the shared component:

```mdx
import { YourProductInstallation } from 'onboarding/your-product/installation.tsx'
import { OnboardingContentWrapper } from 'components/Docs/OnboardingContentWrapper'

<OnboardingContentWrapper snippets={{ ...snippets }}>
    <YourProductInstallation />
</OnboardingContentWrapper>
```

6. If you need snippets, import them and pass to the wrapper:
   - First, create snippet stubs in `contents/docs/<product>/_snippets/` (e.g., `contents/docs/llm-analytics/_snippets/example-snippet.mdx`):

```mdx
<!--
This snippet imports shared onboarding content from the main PostHog repo.
Source: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/docs/onboarding/your-product/_snippets/example-snippet.tsx
See the docs runbook for more info: https://posthog.com/handbook/content/docs-runbook
-->

import { OnboardingContentWrapper } from "components/Docs/OnboardingContentWrapper"
import { ExampleSnippet } from "onboarding/your-product/_snippets/example-snippet.tsx" // +

<OnboardingContentWrapper snippets={{ ExampleSnippet }}> // +
</OnboardingContentWrapper>
```

7. Test locally: Run `pnpm start` and verify the page renders correctly at the expected URL.
8. Commit and merge both the `posthog/posthog` and `posthog/posthog.com` PRs.

### How changes propagate to the website

1. Content is written in the `posthog/posthog` repository's [`docs/onboarding`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding) directory. This shared directory can be imported from the `posthog/posthog` repo and used in the `posthog/posthog.com` repo.
2. Onboarding scenes ([example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/sdks/llm-analytics/LLMAnalyticsSDKInstructions.tsx)) in the `posthog/posthog` repository import the shared onboarding docs. The [wrapper component](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/OnboardingDocsContentWrapper.tsx) passes snippets and components through a context to the shared onboarding docs.
3. Because component and snippet implementations differ between the app and website, the in-app onboarding docs use a [wrapper component](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/OnboardingDocsContentWrapper.tsx) that renders the shared onboarding docs with the appropriate components and snippets.
4. The website uses `gatsby-source-git` to import the shared onboarding docs from the `posthog/posthog` repository. You can find them after running build in the `.cache/gatsby-source-git/posthog-main-repo/docs/onboarding` directory.
5. The website uses aliases to map the import paths to `onboarding/*` (e.g. [`onboarding/llm-analytics/google.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/google.mdx)).
6. The website uses the same [`OnboardingContentWrapper`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/src/components/Docs/OnboardingContentWrapper.tsx) component to render the onboarding docs. This wrapper passes snippets and components through a context to the shared onboarding docs. Usage example: [`onboarding/llm-analytics/google.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/google.mdx).
7. To allow for different implementations such as front matter, different titles, and additional content, the website uses MDX stubs like [`contents/docs/llm-analytics/google.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/google.mdx) and snippet stubs like [`contents/docs/llm-analytics/_snippets/embedding-event.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/_snippets/embedding-event.mdx) with comments to indicate the source of the content.

## SDK reference docs

SDK references document class, method signatures, and type interfaces for each SDK. They complement examples in tutorials and guides by providing a comprehensive reference with all the details. They're important for deep understanding of PostHog SDKs and as context for LLM-based tools. Tutorials and guides reference them for parameter and return type details.

### Which SDKs have reference docs

It's an ongoing effort to create SDK reference docs for all our SDKs, starting with popular SDKs. Here's the current status:

| SDK | Status |
|-----|--------|
| JavaScript Web SDK | ✅ Completed |
| Python SDK | ✅ Completed |
| Node.js SDK | ✅ Completed |
| React Native SDK | ✅ Completed |
| iOS SDK | 🚧 In progress |
| Flutter SDK | ⏳ Not started |
| Android SDK | ⏳ Not started |
| Go SDK | ⏳ Not started |
| Java SDK | ⏳ Not started |
| Rust SDK | ⏳ Not started |
| PHP SDK | ⏳ Not started |
| .NET SDK | ⏳ Not started |

### How the SDK reference docs work

1. SDKs are parsed for basic information like class names, method names, and type interfaces.
2. Descriptions, parameters, return types, and examples are extracted from the SDKs or SDK doc comments.
3. The information is rewritten into a standardized JSON format (HogRef). They're stored in each SDK's repository under a `references` directory. For example, the JavaScript Web SDK reference is [stored here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/tree/main/packages/browser/references).
4. When an SDK releases a new version, the reference docs are generated automatically. Here's an [example workflow](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-references.yml).
5. The Strapi instance behind the website is configured to [fetch the HogRef JSON files](https://github.com/PostHog/squeak-strapi/blob/main/config/cron-tasks.ts) from the SDK's repository and display them on the website via a cron job.
6. The website renders the HogRef JSON files as a table on the SDK reference page.

Each language works slightly differently, but the general process is the same.

<HogRefSchema />
</details>

### How to create new SDK reference docs

To contribute a new SDK reference doc:

1. Create a script to parse the SDK's documentation and extract the information into a HogRef JSON file. The script should:
   - Parse for class names, method names, and type interfaces
   - Extract descriptions, parameters, return types, and examples from the SDK or SDK doc comments
   - Format the information according to the [HogRef JSON schema specification](#hogref-json-schema-specification)
   - Store the HogRef JSON file in a `references` directory in the SDK's repository
   - See existing SDK repositories for examples, such as the [JavaScript Web SDK reference](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/tree/main/packages/browser/references)
2. Create a workflow to generate the HogRef JSON file when a new version of the SDK is released. See an [example workflow](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-references.yml).
3. Update the [`cron-tasks.ts`](https://github.com/PostHog/squeak-strapi/blob/main/config/cron-tasks.ts) file to fetch the HogRef JSON file from the SDK's repository and display it on the website.
4. Once the HogRef is ingested into the Strapi instance via the cron job, a new page should be created automatically on the website. The website will render the HogRef JSON file as a table on the SDK reference page. 
5. Find existing links to the SDK's GitHub repository source code and point them to the new HogRef JSON file instead.

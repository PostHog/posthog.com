At PostHog, we want our docs to win over developers and to give us a competitive edge. That means delivering a world-class developer experience, maintaining a well-organized knowledge base, and writing documentation that is a genuine pleasure to read.

## Our documentation values 

1. Show real code in context
2. Treat docs like a product
3. Embrace the craft of writing
4. Help our customers win

### 1. Show real code in context

Developers don't want oversimplified examples or out-of-context code snippets. They want to solve real problems and use cases.

We want to showcase code that's runnable, practical, and immediately useful.

*As a rule of thumb*, our docs should show code within application context whenever possible. The examples we provide should reflect how PostHog is actually used in production, in the wild. 

**Isolated example:**
```js
posthog.capture('user_signed_up', {
    login_type: "email",
    is_free_trial: true
})
```

If a code snippet has missing application context or business logic, it can be improved.

**In-context example:**
```js
// Importing PostHog into the app
const posthog = require('posthog-node')

app.post('/api/signup', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body

  try {
    const user = await createUser({ email, password })
    // Calling PostHog inside business logic
    posthog.capture({ 
        distinctId: user.id, 
        event: 'user_signed_up',
        properties: {
            is_free_trial: true,
        },
    })
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Signup successful', userId: user.id })
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Signup failed' })
  }
})
```

The in-context example is more verbose, but much more useful. It shows how PostHog fits into applications, which helps developers understand *when* and *where* to use it.

Inline comments and UI enhancements like syntax highlighting and collapsible sections will keep code scannable. We’re working on updating the docs components – coming soon!

### 2. Treat docs like a product

We treat our docs like a product, because they are. They have users (readers), use cases (implementation, product education, troubleshooting, etc.), and success metrics (more on this later). PostHog's goal is to help customers build successful products, and docs play a huge part in that.

Developer docs cross several product boundaries:
- They're a knowledge base and a codebase
- They're a technical spec and a marketing surface
- They're a support resource and an activation funnel

This blend of roles presents unique challenges and opportunities. But ultimately, great docs can drive product activation by providing the *right* information, in the *right* way, at the *right* stage in a [developer's journey](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/dev_journey_9ed427d2c5.webp). 

This could mean helping developers set up their very first PostHog event in a new framework. This could also mean helping existing customers with complex configurations and custom properties smoothly integrate their third or fourth PostHog product. It's a wide spectrum, but the goal is the same: to help developers self-serve and succeed with PostHog.

Docs are a *core* part of the product experience. So when you're working on them, take some time to ask:
- Where is the reader on their PostHog developer journey? 
- Where do they need to go next? 
- How does this help them get there?

### 3. Embrace the craft of writing

Writing is something we love to do here at PostHog. The principles of PostHog [writing](/handbook/content/writing-for-posthog) and [marketing](/handbook/growth/marketing#marketing-values) all apply to docs. 

For documentation writing especially, we prioritize clarity, precision, and consistency because they contribute to a smoother reading experience. Nitpicking isn't just allowed, it's encouraged!

<details>
<summary>Example #2</summary>

Under ~~**User** in your **Settings**~~ **Settings** > **User**, click the button.
</details>

Nits and semantics and formatting (oh my!) – they're all part of the fun of technical writing. Attention to detail is what turns good docs into great ones, so don't shy away from it.

This does *not* mean our docs have to be dry or academic. In fact, they should have a natural flow that makes them easy to read. Be open, direct, and opinionated. Don't be afraid to add humor and style when there's opportunity.

PostHog's writing voice is one of the key things that sets us apart from a sea of generic SaaS platforms. It's important that this voice comes through in our docs.

The [docs style guide](/handbook/content/docs-style-guide) is a key reference we'll continue to update with examples and best practices.

### 4. Help our customers win 

Our customers are smart, discerning, and ambitious. They're here to build. They want to 10x their own products. 

Our docs exist to help them win.

## How we prioritize

Here's how we loosely define high-priority docs work:
- Anything that blocks product adoption or severely impacts the product experience  
- Anything that speeds up new content velocity or improves overall quality
- Anything that unblocks better LLM-assisted workflows
- *Usable* docs (e.g., improve SDK references) come first, *cool* docs (e.g., interactive code editor) come after

## Measuring success

Our north star indicators that tell us if our docs are heading in the right direction:

- Organic praise for our docs (social media, customer calls, G2 reviews, etc.)
- Fewer support tickets caused by bad or missing docs
- More Max AI replies marked as `helpful`
- More docs used by Sales and CS as a valuable resource for customers

Every piece of writing we do has metadata included in it.

## URLs and content folders

The URL is defined by the folder it's placed in and the `filename.md` of the markdown file - e.g. a post in the `founders` folder with the filename `i-love-hedgehogs.md` would have the URL `/founders/i-love-hedgehogs`.

Folders also decide _where_ on the website articles appear.

The main folders are:

- `/contents/docs` - Docs.
- `/contents/blog` - A catch-all posts section. Company announcements, technical deep dives, SEO-focused comparisons, and more.
- `/contents/founders` - Posts written for founders.
- `/contents/product-engineers` - Posts written for product engineers.
- `/contents/newsletter` - Newsletters republished from Product for Engineers.
- `/contents/tutorials` - Tutorials
- `/contents/customers` - Customer stories
- `/contents/spotlight` - Startup spotlight
- `/contents/handbook` - The PostHog company handbook

**Important:** Some articles can rightfully belong in both the founder hub _and_ the product engineers hub. In this case, choose the most appropriate hub folder and then add the `crosspost:` field to your frontmatter so it appears in both. So, add `crosspost: product-engineers` to post a founder's hub article in product engineers as well, and vice versa. You can also add tags from either hub like normal.

## Frontmatter


This is the default frontmatter for most posts:

```
---
title: "Your headline here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: ["your-name"]
featuredImage: IMAGE URL
featuredImageType: full
tags:
  - Content tag here
  - Content tag here
  - Content tag here
  - Content tag here
  - Content tag here
---
```

The frontmatter for tutorials is similar, but they don't require a featured image:

```
---
title: "Your headline here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: ["your-name"]
tags:
  - Content tag here
  - Content tag here
---
```

> **Note:** Each handle in the `author` field must match a handle in the `authors.json` file. If you're a first-time author, add yourself to `authors.json` in the [authors data file](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/src/data/authors.json) using this format:
> ```json
> {
>   "handle": "your-handle", // This is what you'll use in the author field
>   "name": "Your name",
>   "role": "Your role at PostHog",
>   "link_type": "linkedin", // Or "twitter", "github", etc.
>   "link_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
>   "profile_id": 12345 // Your community profile ID from posthog.com/community/profiles/[ID]
> }
> ```

## Tags

Below is a complete list of tags, organized by section. 

You can use tags from the Founder's hub in product engineer posts, and vice versa, if you're crossposting the article.

Note, there are other tags we've used in the past here, but they're largely optional.

### Creating new tags

Creating a new tag is as simple as adding the text to a post â€“ it also means typos can generate new tag pages, so please be observant.

It's best to avoid a proliferation of tags, so please raise an issue before creating a new one.

Yes, I realize LinkedIn has a bad reputation, but it’s a popular channel with our ICP, important for recruiting, and our posts often do well there. We're posting more there, so here's what we've learned about doing it well so far.

## Advice on LinkedInposting

- The hook is everything. Get people to click “show more.” What works:
  - Money - “We spend $X and here are the best things we learned”
  - Dilemma - “What would you choose X or Y?”
  - Provocative statements - “Collaboration sucks”
  - Transformation stories, before and after - “This product helped us go from X to Y”
  - Data reveals - “PostHog has seen an ~8x increase in traffic from ChatGPT in the last year”
  - Resource lists - “Here are the 10 best posts on X”
  - Takeaways - “After weeks of researching X, I’ve published Y deepdive. Here are Z interesting things I learned a long the way.”
  - Work - “I wrote a 2000-word long article on how AI impacts performance of software and systems.”

- Use lists and numbers.

- Be specific with numbers. Say “$8,500” not “around 8k.” This feels more credible, like you aren’t making it up.

- Ask yourself if there’s a story or anecdote you can use to make this real.

- Be useful. Write the posts you want to read.

- To drive clicks to links, either either say “link in comments” and add it to the post ~6 hours later or include an image in your post. The algorithm hates direct posts to links.

- A great graphic goes a lot way. “Zero-click” content like ByteByteGo gets thousands of likes with basically just a graphic. Information does better than memes.

- Add a question at the end to get comments. People want to respond. Comments boost posts in the algorithm, often more than shares do.

- Commenting on popular posts works, comments can get 30k+ impressions.

- Posting time doesn’t matter to going viral.

- Posting daily beats 1-2x/week “perfect” posts. A lot won’t hit, but this will more than pay off for the ones that do.

While we have set up the company to work asynchronously as much as possible, there's a very real benefit in getting together in real life. We've learned that our best ideas come from working together.

## All-company offsites

Every six months the entire company will get together somewhere in the world for a week. Usually we'll all fly on Sunday, have an opening dinner, spend the week doing a mix of hard work, strategy, culture and fun activities and we then all fly back home on Fridays. Our past offsites have been in Italy and Portugal.

These are organized by the Ops & People team, and we budget up to $3,000 per person in total for these. 

## Small team offsites

We want to try to encourage small teams to get together every six months. These are more focused on work and on creating strong bonds within teams. Ideally they happen around three months after an all-company offsite.

Note: we want to try this out with one or two small teams first before rolling it out to the entire team.

Some guidelines:

- These are more focused on work than the all-company offsite, but it's still worth organizing a fun activity, do some sightseeing and in general spend time together.
- We'd encourage you to pick a city that one or more of your team members already live in, and a place that minimises travel time/expenses for everyone else.
- We'd encourage you to get an AirBnB for everyone not living in the city as you automatically get a space you can work from and there's less organizing involved.
- These offsites don't happen very often and involve a lot of travel, so make sure you make the most out of it by having a loose agenda and an idea of what you want to achieve _before_ the start of the trip.

When we have an ops person in place they will be in charge of organising this event but up until then it'll be a combination of Charles, Tim and the relevant small team lead.

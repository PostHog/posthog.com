This page contains security advisories and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to PostHog. We maintain this page to ensure transparency and help our users stay informed about any security issues that may impact them. In the event that a security incident leads to a confirmed exposure or requires action from users we will always contact users proactively. 

For coverage of other, [non-security incidents](/handbook/engineering/incidents), please check [our status page](https://status.posthog.com/). 

## Our approach to security advisories

At PostHog, we take security seriously. Not as a checkbox, but with hardware security keys and healthy paranoia. We have a robust security program that includes:

- Regular security audits, architecture reviews, and penetration testing
- Automated code and infrastructure as code (IaC) linting
- Responsible disclosure program
- Proactive vulnerability monitoring
- Transparent communication with our community

For more information about our security practices, see our [main security page](/handbook/company/security).

## Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in PostHog products or services, please report it to us at **[security@posthog.com](mailto:security@posthog.com)**. Valid findings will be rewarded with PostHog swag.

## Updating this page

PRs to this page which update advisories or CVEs should only occur as part of an incident and should follow all [our usual processes for an incident](/handbook/engineering/incidents). If you need to issue an advisory or CVE and an incident is _not_ declared, you should declare one. 

Declaring an incident will ensure that there is good internal visibility and that members of relevant teams, including our Support team, are aware. Once an advisory is posted to this page, you should also update other teams by posting in the [#tell-posthog-anything](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C0351B1DMUY) Slack channel. 

## Security best practices

Security is everyone's responsibility, so we encourage all our users and staff to follow some basic best practices within their own organizations.

- **Use PostHog Cloud** - [We sunset K8s deployments long ago](/blog/sunsetting-helm-support-posthog) and our OSS version isn't suitable for use at scale. Use PostHog Cloud to ensure you benefit from the latest security updates.
- **Use strong authentication** - Always enable multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, and SSO where available. PostHog supports all of these. 
- **Monitor access** - Regularly review who has access to your PostHog data and follow the principle of least privilege by only giving access to things people _actually_ need. 

We will always proactively reach out to affected users in the event of an advisory requiring attention or action. However, if you'd like to stay updated about future incidents or advisories, please [subscribe to our status page](https://status.posthog.com/). If you want to drink updates from the firehose, you can also follow our [GitHub repos](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) for real-time updates about everything we do, as we're committed to working in the open wherever possible.

  <summary>August 15, 2025 / PSA-2025-00001</summary>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> August 15, 2025<br />
  <strong>Advisory:</strong> PSA-2025-00001<br />
  <strong>Severity:</strong> Medium<br />
  <strong>Status:</strong> Resolved</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>An overly permissive table was available in the SQL editor that allowed users to see queries performed by other users in unrelated teams. The results of those queries were <em>not</em> accessible, but the queries themselves were visible.</p>

  <h4>Affected users</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Our logs confirm that this feature was never used in our EU cloud.</li>
    <li>Our historical query log for the US cloud only contains data going back to July 3, 2025, and we can confirm the feature was not used during that period.</li>
    <li>We do not have query logs between December 12, 2024, and July 2, 2025. While we cannot fully confirm usage during this window, we believe it is very unlikely the feature was used in our US cloud, as it was never advertised.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Resolution</h4>
  <p>Once discovered, we immediately removed the ability to query this table. We then reintroduced the feature with queries properly scoped to each userâ€™s team.</p>

  <h4>What we learned</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>We have a logic guard to ensure that all queries contain a properly authorized <code>team_id</code> when the queried table includes a <code>team_id</code> field.</li>
    <li>This logic did not help in this case because the query log table did not contain a <code>team_id</code> field.</li>
    <li>We have since added a <code>team_id</code> field to this table and audited all other tables to verify that they contain a <code>team_id</code> field where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Going forward, we will introduce automated tests to ensure that all new tables also include a <code>team_id</code> field.</li>
    <li>Our historical query log contains a longer dataset in the EU cloud simply because it was deployed there first. Going forward, our US cloud logs will continue to accumulate historical data for future incident response.</li>
  </ul>

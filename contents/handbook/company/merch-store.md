We have a [merch store](/merch) where our community can purchase high quality PostHog-branded merch. The People & Ops team is responsible for managing merch inventory, fulfillment etc. even though multiple people contribute, and Kendal is the point person.

We use [Micromerch](https://www.micromerch.com/) to manufacture and fulfill our merch. Anyone can suggest a product for us to sell or give away. 

The Brand & Vibes team ultimately decide on what items we wish to sell or give away (including how many and sizes), and Lottie provides assets to produce and order these items in to stock.

We generally try to launch new products in line with the typical fashion cycle (spring/summer and fall/winter). However, this doesn't mean we can't do fun side quests! If you are looking to do an off-cycle merch run, just make sure you keep Kendal in the loop so the admin side goes smoothly.

## How to reorder merch

All of our permanent merch items are reordered via Micromerch. To do this you need to:

1. Request a restock of the item(s) through the Micromerch x PostHog Slack channel
2. If the design is already on file, there's nothing more to do, the Micromerch team will get printing! If the design is not already on file, send over the vector file of the design and they will mock it up for us.
3. Pay the invoice via Brex once it comes in (usually in 1-2 days after design approval)

It's really important that we do not allow stock levels to run low as restocking items can take a couple of weeks, so the Ops team will regularly check inventory levels. However if you happen to see anything looking amiss, or you know you want to place a big order for a customer that may affect our stock levels a lot, just let Kendal know ahead of time!

## Adding new items

If you need a new item designed completely from scratch, please create an issue and tag Lottie and Kendal. Please include:
1. What the item is that you want to create
2. The kind of design you want on there to help Lottie out
3. The deadline you're looking to have this shipped (either to the merch store or an event etc)

From there, Kendal and Lottie can take over and sort the logistics of getting the item made!

## Shipping

Shipping is also done through Micromerch - they can ship to over 200 territories worldwide:

* When orders come in from our Shopify store they will automatically be shipped to the customer them via Shiphero (this is the shipping company that Micromerch use)
* If you want to ship merch for an event or as part of a giveaway, do this from the Shopify dashboard directly.

## Merch giveaways

### Customers

Create a discount code in <PrivateLink url="https://admin.shopify.com/store/posthog/discounts">Shopify admin</PrivateLink>. You don't need to be invited to Shopify, instead the login details are stored in [1Password](https://start.1password.com/signin?l=en).

When creating the discount, select "amount off products" then choose if it is a percentage off or a fixed amount - usually we do fixed amounts of $30, $50, or $100 depending on the purpose. The you can choose "specific collections" and choose "All Products". 

> Limit the use to one use only (_not_ one use per customer), otherwise it's unlimited free stuff for them, unlimited high cost for us! 

For feedback or general rewards we typically give users $30, which is enough for a t-shirt. For code contributions we tend to do $50, which is enough for a bigger selection of things. We don't put expiration dates on the codes, typically.

If you need any help just send a message to the <PrivateLink url="https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C04DWKH7DM3">#merch</PrivateLink> channel and somebody will be happy to help. Merch codes can also be generated directly from within Zendesk.

### PostHog team

If you want more, <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/runbooks/blob/main/docs/merch.md"> here's how to get it! </PrivateLink> 

As always, we expect you to use this with restraint and with your own good judgement. The merch store should not become your sole source of clothing for your wardrobe, nor where you go any time a friend has a birthday. But sure, go ahead and buy your mom (or yourself) a hat or a hoodie!

### YC Deal

You can find instructions for this on the dedicated [YC Deal page](/handbook/growth/sales/yc-onboarding).

## Troubleshooting customer orders

Sometimes customers get in touch with us because their order hasn't arrived. There are a couple of things you can do:

1. Check the <PrivateLink url="https://admin.shopify.com/store/posthog/orders">Shopify</PrivateLink> in Shopify.
2. Once you've located the order in Shopify, you can see the status of the order. If it's been hanging around for a while with no movement, give Kendal a ping and she can follow up with Micromerch.
3. Directly in Shopify, you can also modify customer's details (as long as the order hasn't shipped yet) like delivery address, contact number, etc.

> **Note:** There have been some issues with fulfilling orders to Brazil due to the country's customs policies.

If for some reason their second order attempt doesn't make it through, refund their money and apologetically let them know that unfortunately our supplier is having issues shipping to their address. It's better to stop the back-and-forth at that point, rather than having a frustrated customer placing multiple orders that don't work. We aren't an e-commerce business, so ensuring a flawless merch store experience for a handful of edge case orders is not a priority!

If the customer was given a merch code to thank them for submitting a PR, you can offer to make a donation on their behalf for the equivalent amount to a company of their choice on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/search?q=&type=COLLECTIVE) instead.

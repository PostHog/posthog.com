## Building Community through Async, Remote Environment

As we grow, we want to be intentional about buidling community within our teams, especially in a remote, asynchronous environment!

## Team Lunches

Every two-weeks, we hop on zoom to have a meal together. This is an opportunity to connect with recent
hires on the team or chat on any person projects you're working on! 

Note: These meals are paid for through Posthog, but be sure to expense them on your company card.

## Viledge

[Viledge](https://viledge.com/) is a startup based out of N.Y. that delivers mindful moments and group activities, made and curated
by black-owned businesses. Once a quarter, a curated box is delievered at each teammates door. Whether its planting
a succulent, painting a portrait, or wine tasting, we're bringing these special moments of community to you.

## Team Highlights

As we grow, we want to be intentional about teammates knowing one another. Every two-weeks, one employee will have the opportunity
to share a bit more about them, what they're working on currently, and how they spend their times outside of work. This is informal, likely
over a lunch, but gives teammates a chance to share more about themselves.

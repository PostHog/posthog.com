## Design request process

> **Working on a blog post?** Because of the volume of requests for blog art, we have a separate GitHub project board to track these. Simply tag the `Art requests` project (instead of the Design board). No need to create a separate issue just for artwork - the full context in the main useful may be useful to us! Just provide the deadline in a comment along with the requested filename which should match what's added to the post's `featuredImage` value in the post's meta data. ([Here's our process](/handbook/growth/marketing/exporting-blog-post-image) for creating blog art and exporting from Figma.)

Since design is currently a shared resource, the most efficient process is to add the _Design_ project to your existing issue.

After triaging, the issue will appear in our [GitHub Org project](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/3) where we manage our current design projects.

The following details will help us triage incoming requests:

1. What do you need designed and why?
1. What is the deadline?

**When looping in design, be sure to reference a GitHub issue so we have full context of the problem.** Threads should primarily be kept on GitHub. (If an Issue is time-sensitive, mention the Issue on Slack in `#design-feedback`.)

### When to loop in design

Because we hire self-starters, there is no expectation that every project should start by running through design _first_.

Depending on your preferred workflow, there are different ways we can get involved.

_The scenarios below largely pertain to work on the main PostHog app._

**If you built something and just need some polish...**

Feel free to share a link (or screenshot) of what you've built. We can provide UX or design feedback for your consideration.

**If you built something and realize it needs some UX love...**

Share a link (or screenshot) of what you've built. Depending on the state of the project, we can either go back to the wireframe stage to rethink some things, or figure out a phased approach to incremental improvement.

**If you designed your own wireframes or mocks...**

Sometimes if you have domain knowledge or have been thinking about a project for a while, it might make more sense for you to start the design process. Feel free to share with us for a second opinion, or if you think certain UIs or flows are suboptimal.

**If you'd like some design help before you break ground...**

More like a typical product development process, please share the high level goals or spec, or any other documentation you have about a feature or enhancement. Be sure to specify the line between MVP and nice-to-haves.

**Need help brainstorming a flow?**

Provide as much documentation about the goals of the project. Depending on the project, we may be able to sketch out some ideas and share in the GitHub issue.

In some cases, it may make sense to jump on a Zoom to sketch out some ideas together.

## Using Slack for feedback

We often use the [`#design-feedback`](https://posthog.slack.com/messages/design-feedback) Slack channel to share updates when we're particularly interested in feedback. We'll always link to the relevant place for discussion. (It's best to keep direct feedback off of Slack.)

This Slack channel isn't limited to the design team. If you're looking for a second opinion on the UX of something you're building, we encourage anyone to share screenshots and a link to Figma or wherever the mockup was produced so we can provide useful feedback or assist in iterating on a design.

Design is currently a shared resource at PostHog. This explains what we do, our design process, and how we can assist across the PostHog team.

## Design's role at PostHog

1. Support Small Teams (and contributors) in building better versions of PostHog
1. Enable customers to build better products (using PostHog)
1. Communicate to prospective customers the value we provide

### Tangibly, we:

1. Initiate new projects to support the roles listed above
1. Support Small Teams in completing their sprint tasks
1. Iterate based on feedback from customers

## Our process

Design tasks are managed with our [GitHub Org project](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/3). This aggregates design-related tasks from the main three repositories for the company:

1. [PostHog app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) - open source repo
1. [posthog.com](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com) - website + docs
1. Internal - higher-level company strategy

### How our Design board works

Cards generally move from left to right.

1. **Design requests** - anyone can post here. (Please follow our [Design Request Process](#design-request-process) below.)
1. **Backlog** - things on our radar
1. **This week** - equivalent of our sprint
1. **In progress** - tasks we've started but haven't completed
1. **Awaiting implementation** - in development or in review
1. **Done** - shipped!

## Design Request Process

Since design is currently a shared resource, the best way design requests can be handled is by creating an issue in the relevant repository, then adding to the _Design_ project.

After triaging, the Issue will appear in our [GitHub Org project](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/3) where we manage our current design projects.

The following details will help us triage incoming requests:

1. What do you need designed and why?
1. What is the deadline?

**Note:** We may defer some design requests if we're planning a larger overhaul in the near term. For example, if a request is to create an icon, we may suggest an alternate solution (like pulling an icon from The Noun Project) if we have a larger plan for revamping all icons in a section in the near future.

### When to loop in design

Because we hire self-starters, there is no expectation that every project should start by running through design _first_.

Depending on your preferred workflow, there are different ways we can get involved.

When looping in design, be sure to reference a GitHub issue so we have full context of the problem. Threads should primarily be kept on GitHub. (If an Issue is time-sensitive, mention the Issue on Slack in `#design-feedback`.)

_The scenarios below largely pertain to work on the main PostHog app._

**If you built something and just need some polish...**

Feel free to share a link (or screenshot) of what you've built. We can provide UX or design feedback for your consideration.

**If you built something and realize it needs some UX love...**

Share a link (or screenshot) of what you've built. Depending on the state of the project, we can either go back to the wireframe stage to rethink some things, or figure out a phased approach to incremental improvement.

**If you designed your own wireframes or mocks...**

Sometimes if you have domain knowledge or have been thinking about a project for a while, it might make more sense for you to start the design process. Feel free to share with us for a second opinion, or if you think certain UIs or flows are suboptimal.

**If you'd like some design help before you break ground...**

More like a typical product development process, please share the high level goals or spec, or any other documentation you have about a feature or enhancement. Be sure to specify the line between MVP and nice-to-haves.

**Need help brainstorming a flow?**

Provide as much documentation about the goals of the project. Depending on the project, we may be able to sketch out some ideas and share in the GitHub issue.

In some cases, it may make sense to jump on a Zoom to sketch out some ideas together.

## Feedback

We often use the `#design-feedback` Slack channel for soliciting specific feedback on wireframes or mockups.

We do our best to explain the type of feedback we're looking for. (Ex: Overall visual aesthetic, flow, if a design communicates to our developer-focused audience, etc.)

This Slack channel isn't limited to the design team. If you're looking for a second opinion on the UX of something you're building, we encourage anyone to share screenshots. If the design requires further collaboration, create an Issue.

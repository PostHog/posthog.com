PostHog is structured for speed, autonomy and innovation.

Traditional organizations have big, separate functions. You have a product team, an engineering team, customer support, and so on. This slows things down, which stifles innovation - you have to get your boss to talk to someone else's boss to get work done. It also means that people can't really see the impact of their work.

PostHog started off as a completely flat company with one big goal: to increase the number of successful products in the world.

As we are getting bigger, we realized that it's harder for people to see the direct impact of their work, which reduces the sense of ownership.

We have therefore introduced Small Teams. These are designed to each operate like a startup. 

# How it works

* A Small Team should never be more than ten people
* A Small Team has an Accountable Person responsible for its performance - whoever is most appropriate depending on what the team is working on. Who would make the right founder for that bit of the company?
* A Small Team must have (1) a customer, (2) a mission and (3) metrics
* There may be certain functions where at our current stage we don't need a Small Team yet.

# Small Teams list

* Core analytics
* Feature flags and a/b testing
* VPC deployment
* Website and docs
* Extensibility: plugins and APIs
* Session recording
* Event capture (SDKs, autocapture)
* Growth engineering (customer = _internal_ teams above)

# Functional teams

* Ops
* Marketing
* Customer Success

# FAQ

## Who do Small Teams report to?

Small teams _may_ be nested in future. In the short run, this isn't needed as we definitely aren't big enough.

## Who is in a small team?

Fewer than 10 people, but that's the only rule. It may be all stack engineers, there may be a single product person, there could be a customer success person.

## Will this lead to inconsistent design?

Eventually, yes. Other companies have a UX team that build components for everyone to use. Since we currently use Ant Design, we don't need this just yet.

## Can people change teams?

If urgent, although ideally if there is a gap, we'd fill it by hiring and not creating a hole somewhere else. This means people can own each area for longer than a single sprint so they can see the impact of their work longer term as it starts to add up.

## Aren't most our Small Teams way too small?

Yes. This will clarify where people will work. In fact, it'll make sure we keep the scrappy fun side of working here as we get bigger.

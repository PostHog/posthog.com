The goal of our [small teams structure](/handbook/company/small-teams) is to remain fast, innovative, and autonomous as we scale.

This means team changes should happen quickly (in less than one week) and transparently. 

We should never run lengthy consultations or meetings with all those affected by a proposed team change, but there should always be time for people to share feedback, and alternative solutions, before a decision is made.

## How to propose a team change

Follow this process whether you're proposing creating a new team, splitting up an existing team in two, or even closing down a team.

### 1. Create a team change proposal issue

You can use the template in company internal to do so, a version of which is shared below. A good proposal should:

- Tag all those **directly** affected by the change, and the Blitzscale Team member directly responsible for this area of the business.

- Include context about why you're suggesting the change and the goals you think this change will help us achieve.

- Be as concise as possible. This isn't an RFC, our goal is to make a quick decision.

```
## Summary of proposed team change

[words here, bullet points are preferred]

## Problem(s) making this change will solve

[words here, bullet points are preferred]

## Changes of feature ownership (if applicable)

[list any changes to feature ownership if they apply]

## People affected by the change

[tag everyone directly affected]

## Decision maker

[usually the Blitzscale team member responsible for this area of the business]

## Deadline for decision

[no more than three working days after the proposal is made]
```

### 2. Share your proposal widely

Please share the issue in the relevant team Slack channels, the #team-blitzscale Slack channel, and any relevant public channels, requesting feedback.

It's generally best to post once and then forward that message to other relevant channels.

Include the deadline for the decision in your message and tag the directly affected people.

Our goal is to make the best possible decision as fast as possible. When giving feedback, consider the following:

- Are there considerations the proposer isn't aware of that could impact the decision we make? Please share them and suggest solutions. Often these relate to feature ownership. 

- Is there a better or alternative solution? Disagreeing with a proposal is fine, but it's always best to propose a solution than to just disagree without an alternative.

- Be direct and clear about how strongly you feel. If you're strongly against a change, explain why and make that clear. Likewise, if you're unsure about a change, but don't feel strongly, articulate that. Consensus is not our goal and decisions being blocked by people who are less invested in the outcome will slow us down and lead to worse decision-making.

### 3. Share the final decision in Slack

The final decision should always be made by the relevant member(s) of the Blitzscale Team in a timely fashion.

Once made, they should share their decision in #tell-posthog-anything and the relevant team channels, alongside a short summary of why we're making that change.

## FAQ

### What if I want to move teams?

Individuals wishing to change teams should speak directly with their line manager. This process exists purely for making larger changes to existing teams, or forming new ones, that impact multiple people.

### What happens after a decision is made?

This is covered on the [small teams handbook page](/handbook/company/small-teams#forming-new-small-teams).

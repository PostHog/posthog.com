## Responsibilities

- **Product teams** are responsible for ensuring their docs are up-to-date. This means:
  - Documenting new features when they're launched.
  - Correcting mistakes reported by users.
  - Clarifying documentation based on user feedback and support tickets.

- **Content marketing** is responsible for improving the overall quality of the docs. This means:
  - Polishing draft documentation created by product teams.
  - Identifying and improving low quality documentation.
   - Ensuring screenshots and other visual elements are up-to-date.
  - Shipping supplementary docs and tutorials based on feedback and emerging use cases.

- **Website & Docs** is responsible for design, organization, and discovery. This means:
  - The design and content of index pages.
  - The overall layout of docs and how they're organized.
  - In-page elements and components – e.g. light and dark mode screenshots.
  - Website search and other elements that help users find the answers they need.

## Frequently asked questions

### I'm really busy, can the content team write docs for me?

No. The content team isn't big enough to own all documentation. It also lacks the context necessary to document new features. First drafts of documentation must always come from the relevant product team.

If you need help updating documentation:

- Write a draft that covers the basics, which the content team can then help review and polish.
- In the event multiple pages needed updating, create an example of changes needed and then request help to complete the rest.

**Bottom line:** It's much easier for the content team to improve a draft than write completely new documentation, especially when documenting new features. PR > Issues.

### Who should review docs updates?

For larger updates, please tag Lior and/or Ian from the content team, and Cory from the Website & Docs team, in addition to other relevant team members.

Cory and Kunal work closely to spearhead website-related projects. Cory largely focses on [general website betterment](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/13) and Kunal focuses on [growth](/handbook/people/team-structure/growth).

For both projects, Cory typically uses the following process:

## Step 1: Wireframes [Balsamiq]

If an early draft is being shared, we'll likely build a low fidelity wireframe in something like Balsamiq. At this stage, we're mostly focused on laying out content, crafting messaging, and loosely tying in a visual hierarchy and layout. (Don't look too closely at fonts, specific colors, or visualizations - those come later.)

*Note: Balsamiq uses its own Comic Sans-style font. Don't get hung up on this!*

## Step 2: Hi-fi designs [Figma]

Once a design is laid out, we'll move into hi-fidelity mockups built in Figma. This process usually takes a few rounds to perfect, and we often iterate up until the moment the design is passed off for development.

If you peek at our Figma files, we usually wrap up final mockups in a page called Deliverables.

Any mocks in pages that appear to be faded out are considered _old_ and _out of date_ and can be ignored, as there is a better replacement nearby. (We sometimes want to keep them around for easy reference (and to leave a comment trail), but they're easily identifiable because their artboards are set to 50% opacity.)

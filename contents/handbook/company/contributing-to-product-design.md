## Getting started
* Design work happens in [Figma](https://figma.com/) in the [App project](https://www.figma.com/files/project/17131046/App?fuid=987006441684352800). If you need access to a Figma project, ask [Cory Watilo](/handbook/company/team/#cory-watilo-lead-designer) but everyone on the company should have View access.
* All product design work uses the [Inter font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).
* Product does not have a design system at this time. There is some component documentation in progress in the [design system project](https://www.figma.com/file/Y9G24U4r04nEjIDGIEGuKI/PostHog-Design-System-One?node-id=576%3A308).

## Reviews &amp; critique

In order to ensure users have a good experience, we review each others' work. When requesting feedback, be sure to consider the following guidelines:
* What kind of feedback are you looking for? Be as specific as possible.
* Have you provided sufficient context for the solution you're proposing? It can be hard to measure the success of a solution if you aren't fully aware of the problem being solved. For any work we're reviewing, there should be a corresponding GitHub issue.
* Does your design use existing components? If not, do you have some justification for why you've deviated from the current patterns?
* What are the advantages of this component over alternative components?
* Is your design consistent with the visual style we have established for the product? If you're deviating, be sure to provide some details on why and on what problems you're hoping to solve.
* Have you considered pseudo states and other interaction patterns for your designs? Hover, focus, animation, etc.
* Does your design follow basic UX best practices?
* Does your design use clear language, correct grammar, and adhere to our [writing style](/handbook/company/communication#writing-style)?

## All Remote

Our [team](/handbook/company/team) is 100% remote, and distributed across over 10 countries.

### Advantages

* Hiring [amazing people](/handbook/company/team) from a global talent pool
* This encourages a deeper level of personal thought and [writing things down](/handbook/values#communication)
* We have an open core business model. This helps the community understand our decision-making.
* It allows for uninterrupted work.
* It makes results clearer, which helps us hold people to account for outcomes rather than hours spent in the office.

## Everyone is a moderator

Almost everything we do is open for anyone else to edit. This includes things like the contents of this very Handbook.

### Advantages

* This allows anyone to give direct feedback on work they think could be improved.
* People can work on what they're interested in.
* This helps increase our responsiveness to the community.

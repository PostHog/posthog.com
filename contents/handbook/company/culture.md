So, what's it like working at PostHog?

##Â A day in the life

## All Remote

Our [team](/handbook/company/team) is 100% remote, and distributed across over 10 countries.

As well as the equipment you'll need, we provide [a budget to help you find coworking space](/handbook/people/spending-money#work-space) or to cover the costs of coffees for those who prefer not to work at home.

### Advantages

* Hiring [amazing people](/handbook/company/team) from a global talent pool.
* This encourages a deeper level of personal thought and writing things down.
* We have an open core business model. This helps the community understand our decision-making.
* It allows for uninterrupted work.
* It makes results clearer, which helps us hold people to account for outcomes rather than hours spent in the office.

## Everyone is a moderator

Almost everything we do is open for anyone else to edit. This includes things like the contents of this very Handbook.

### Advantages

* This allows anyone to give direct feedback on work they think could be improved.
* People can work on what they're interested in.
* This helps increase our responsiveness to the community. 

## Write stuff down

There is power in writing things down. We see transparency as part of this.

* It creates clear and deep thought.
* It is usually clearer than a conversation, so everyone can row in the same direction.
* It is very leveraged as we grow a large community and look to hire people around the world.

## Don't let others fail

Everyone should help everyone else raise their game.

* Fatigue sets in when you complete a task. It's easier for outsiders to help those creating the work to raise their game.
* We are direct about the quality of work. That doesn't always mean work needs to be completely polished. It also concerns:
  * The speed of a task.
  * The validity of a task in helping the company move forward.
  * The impact of a task.

## Iteration

If given a choice, go live. If you can't go live, reduce the task size so you can.

* We are small, and can only win based on speed and agility.
* Going live forces a level of completion, on which you can build.

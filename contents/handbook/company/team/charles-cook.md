This guide might be helpful in working with me.

## Areas of responsibility

- Making sure all our business operations run smoothly
- Overseeing all things marketing, including managing our external paid ads agency
- All of our financial reporting and planning, including managing our external accountants
- Any legal matters, including compliance and privacy - I am the main point of contact with our lawyers
- Making sure our customer support systems (ie. Papercups) run smoothly
- I contribute a lot to our people and culture initiatives, like running BookHogs
- Investor relations and fundraising ops, supporting Tim and James and doing all the legal paperwork with our lawyers 
- I do regular 1-1s with half of the team to chat about non-work stuff (Eltje does the other half)

## Quirks

- I'm hyper responsive across any channel (email/Slack/whatever) - don't worry about interrupting me if you have a question! Always happy to take a quick call too if you prefer.
- I definitely err on the side of speed at the expense of polish. Sometimes this means I don't take enough time to bring other people on board when I should. 
- I tend towards being generous with spending money, _especially_ if it means getting something done faster. 
- I make a lot of jokes at my own expense. I encourage you to as well.
- You don't have to 'earn' my trust - I like to assume high trust with people I work with from the start and go from there. 
- I don't respond to work emails at evenings or weekends. I do have Slack on my phone if something really urgent comes up during the week - at the weekend, you'd need to text me. Please don't abuse this. 

## What I value

- [Brutal honesty, delivered kindly](https://feld.com/archives/2014/08/brutal-honesty-delivered-kindly.html). 
- Kindness generally, in fact. 
- Not taking yourself too seriously and keeping a sense of perspective.
- Speed - I can get frustrated if people don't move as quickly as I like to. 
- People who understand privilege and how it affects power dynamics.  
- Taking on something that is outside your comfort zone if no one else is available. 

## How I can help you

- I can help you figure out where X account is, what our Y number is or where we keep Z thingy. 
- I can shed more light on what our marketing strategy is and how we position ourselves. 
- I can help you unblock any legal or financial issues. Anything admin-related really. 
- I can be a listening ear any time you need, for work or non-work stuff. 
- I can provide you with general career advice, especially if you are interested in people management. 

## How you can help me

- If you need me to do something for you (rather than just answer a question), please shoot me an email instead of Slack, as it's easier for me to track. 
- Tell me what we could be doing better from a company-building perspective. I'm particularly interested in unusual ideas. 
- Give feedback on our marketing initiatives - especially if you are a developer!
- Let me know when I need to slow down and do something to a higher standard. 
- I try to make sure our ops systems for things like expenses have an absolutely minimal impact on your time. Please don't make me chase you for boring admin stuff like that. 
- If you need something from me, let me know when you need it by. Otherwise I'll probably do it immediately, which might come at the expense of something more important.

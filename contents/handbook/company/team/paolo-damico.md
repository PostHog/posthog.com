## Q4 2021 Goals

- **Product strategy.**
  - Build the _core product_ strategy for Q4-21 (particularly related to Collaboration & Experimentation).
  - Support Exec Team with context, feedback and any other activity in shaping up the product strategy for the next quarter.
- **Product execution (goals for each milestone).**
  - Clearly define what success is for each milestone.
  - Successful (*see above*) delivery of all milestones from product strategy.
  - Ensure ownership and accountability on every feature by a single engineer. Help owners improve on workflow, prioritization, solution scoping & post-delivery.
- **User experience.**
  - Measurably increase the user experience.
  - Reduce my number of **code** reviews and PRs (*to increase the depth of UX reviews*).
- **Enterprise support.**
  - Ensure the essential set of enterprise features are built in a timely fashion (including prioritization, scoping, context sharing).
  - Ensure only the essential engineering resources are used for revenue activities, making sure any major clients are unblocked.

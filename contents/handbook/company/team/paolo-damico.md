## Q1 2022 Goals
- ⭐️ Craft a clear **vision** for an ambitious goal that gets everyone **very excited**!
- ⭐️ Build the strategy for one **ambiguous opportunity** to improve a company metric or achieve a company goal (_should be ready to be worked on by end of Q1_).
- Enable Core Experience Team to plan their sprints and ship higher quality features autonomously.
- Aid Engineering Team to ensure we ship Collaboration for Launch Week.

## Q4 2021 Goals

### Planning

- **Product strategy.**
  - ⭐️ Build the _core product_ strategy for Q4-21. _Likely related to Collaboration, Experimentation and "Making more successful products". These will be very ambitious goals, that will directly impact company-level metrics (see [Product metrics](/handbook/product/metrics))._
  - Support Exec Team with context, feedback and any other activity in shaping up the product strategy for the next quarter/year. In particular, ensure we have clear company-level product metrics and we have a plan for improving them.
- **Product execution.**
  - ⭐️ Ensure ownership and accountability on every key feature by a single engineer, particularly with defining clear and ambitious goals for each epic in each sprint. _Help owners improve on workflow, prioritization, solution scoping (particularly around overscoping) & post-delivery._
  - Clearly define what success is for each milestone.
  - Successful (*see above*) delivery of all milestones from product strategy.
- **User experience.**
  - ⭐️ Develop a strong culture within Product & Engineering for the quality bar of features. Improve the bar for core shipped features, lower the bar for MVPs.
  - Improve iteration speed by removing me as a dependency for code reviews and PRs.
- **Enterprise & Growth support.**
  - Ensure the essential set of 1) enterprise and 2) revenue features are built in a timely manner (including prioritization, scoping, context sharing) to unblock customers. _Right trade-off between never blocking enterprise customers and ensuring resources are only used when needed._

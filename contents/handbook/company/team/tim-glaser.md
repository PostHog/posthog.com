This guide might be helpful in working with me.

## Bio

I've been coding since I've been 11, which isn't as long ago as I'd like it to be. Someone first paid me to write code when I was 13 (though I'm sure they regretted it) and someone else gainfully employed me when I was 16.

Originally from the Netherlands, though I quickly moved to London (I do not generally enjoy nice weather) where I joined Arachnys and shortly met James Hawkins. I went from being a software engineer, to product manager, to "leading" an R&D team, which consisted of just me.

After four years I thought it was time to go do something else and had lined up a new job. Roughly 37 seconds after it was announced James wanted to "grab a beer." While plying me with alcohol, he convinced me to give up this fancy new job and instead start a startup with him.

In my 'spare' time, I fall down snowy mountains, wrestle in the mud over an egg-shaped ball and watch a lot of Bondi beach in order to perfect my Australian accent.

##Â Areas of responsibility

- Build the engineering team
- Make sure we move fast
- Make sure the engineering team has all the context it needs
- Make sure the engineering team is happy
- Make sure we're building in the right direction
- Sounding board to James Hawkins (CEO)

## Quirks

- I come out with opinions quickly and strongly. They are actually weakly held so please push back when you disagree, I'll take it well.
- I will likely talk way too much. Please just interject/talk over me.
- A lot of what I say sounds like a definitive statement ("this is what we're going to do") when I actually mean "here's something we could do".
- I'm easily distracted in meetings and can come across as disinterested. It's something I'm working on but if you notice I'm drifting off please mention it.
- Weekends are holy to me and I'll almost never work on a weekend (and don't expect anyone else to!). I also don't like to have meetings after ~8pm my time, or before 10-11am.
- Please don't message me "hey" and then spend 3 minutes typing your question. Adding those two together is fine.
- I like my meetings clustered together.
- I can be too frugal with company money.

## What I value

- Ownership. Please don't wait for me to give the go-ahead. Bias over action.
- People who get things done without me having to chase. I love it if we mention something should get done and there's a PR for it the next day.
- Speed. It's much easier to get things right if you take more shots at goal. Let's just get something up and iterate on it.
- Receiving feedback. Please give me a ton of feedback, I still have a huge amount to go and will only improve if I get feedback.
- When I give feedback, I'd appreciate if you consider it first before defending yourself. I may have gotten it wrong and feel free to push back, but I don't like it when people start defending themselves straight away.
- I'm not a big fan of meetings. Please write your thoughts up in a GitHub issue/PR first. We can always have a meeting after that which will likely be more productive.
- I like short, to the point writing. Use short words, bullet points and screenshots.
- Directness. If you don't like something please just say so.


## How I can help you

- I can help you figure out how to build something in 1/2 the time you think it should take
- I can help you figure out what you should be working on
- I can help you figure out what to do in your career
- I can help be a rubber duck
- I can help bounce ideas around

## How you can help me

- Come to 1:1s with an agenda and clear things I can help with
- Give me feedback
- Bring up problems, don't hide them. As a startup we'll always have a million problems, it's our job to surface those and fix the important ones.

## Nomading

I currently don't have a fixed address, and tend to move places every 2-3 months. If I remember to update it, [you can see where I am and where I'm going here](https://nomadlist.com/@timgl). I'd love to meet up with anyone if it's within a reasonable distance (and sometimes even if it's not). Would love for you to reach out and organise something.

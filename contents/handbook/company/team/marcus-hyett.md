## Feedback actions
Based on feedback from the company feedback sessions during our most recent offsite, these are the main areas I'm going to focus on improving
* Feedback: Be more concise & keep going into a lot of detail
    * Action: Provide TL;DRs when I write something long so most people can get the detail at a glance and those who want to know all the nitty gritty details can read on
* Feedback: Increase transparency (e.g. don't create a doc you share with a few people first)
    * Action: Create request for comments PRs in appropriate repo over using docs - always bias for public / open repos when possible
* Feedback: Get clearer about what we're not doing
    * Action: Create an anti-strategy (e.g. what we're not doing and why, along with a deprecation strategy - for what we are doing and should stop) and align the company om this
* Feedback: Give more feedback and structure to help others grow 
    * Action: Work with Ops to create a clear progression framework, invest in preparing feedback for growth to share in 1:1s
* Feedback: Help others understand how they can help me (be less unpredictable / freeform when you need help) (e.g. what motivates me)
    * Action: I will set clearer expectations ahead of time when I'm likely to need help and I will update this readme with my goals for Q4 and my overall motivations in the next two weeks

## Goals (6 weeks until 6 Aug 2021)

*   **Strategy**
    *   Build a strong case for our next strategic milestone for after we have “Nailed funnels”
        *   e.g. should we invest in integrations with data warehouses, trends, heat-maps or something else next? What is the next big “wave” and how do we catch it?
    *   Define and chart a set of core metrics for our product to enable us to drive product growth
        *   E.g. What does our core funnel look like? What’s our 7 friends in 10 days?
*   **Execution**
    *   Achieve the ambitious goal of “Nailing funnels to get 5 reference customers in our focus segment” 
        *   Supporting the team to breakdown down complex user problems into solvable units
        *   Working closely James and (Ref Goals) with prospects / customers to ensure they’re getting the most out of our product improvements
        *   Writing / publishing articles on the value of funnels and growth product management for our target audience
    *   Nothing else
        *   Don’t get distracted

    **Personal**

    *   Hike the “Ring of Steaal” (in Scotland) - 1700m ascent, in one day via the non-death route
    *   Overcome all of the complications and admin of buying our first house

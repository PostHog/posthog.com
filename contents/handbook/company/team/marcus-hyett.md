## Goals (6 weeks until 6 Aug 2021)

*   **Strategy**
    *   Build a strong case for our next strategic milestone for after we have “Nailed funnels”
        *   e.g. should we invest in integrations with data warehouses, trends, heat-maps or something else next? What is the next big “wave” and how do we catch it?
    *   Define and chart a set of core metrics for our product to enable us to drive product growth
        *   E.g. What does our core funnel look like? What’s our 7 friends in 10 days?
*   **Execution**
    *   Achieve the ambitious goal of “Nailing funnels to get 5 reference customers in our focus segment” 
        *   Supporting the team to breakdown down complex user problems into solvable units
        *   Working closely James and (Ref Goals) with prospects / customers to ensure they’re getting the most out of our product improvements
        *   Writing / publishing articles on the value of funnels and growth product management for our target audience
    *   Nothing else
        *   Don’t get distracted

    **Personal**

    *   Hike the “Ring of Steaal” (in Scotland) - 1700m ascent, in one day via the non-death route
    *   Overcome all of the complications and admin of buying our first house

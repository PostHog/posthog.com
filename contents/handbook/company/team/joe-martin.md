# Bio

[This is my fifth start-up](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joemartinwords/). 

Before I took up Product Marketing I was a Content Marketer, a Copywriter and a Journalist. Before _that_ I was a clown, a chainsaw salesman and a cleaner in a morgue. It's been a strange life. 

I live just outside of London. I'm passionate about punk music, videogame preservation and garlic. I can't ride a bike.

### How I can help you
- I can help you figure out the right way to communicate anything, to anyone. 
- I can help you with a broad range of marketing tasks, including sales enablement. 
- I can help you understand our customers, our competitors or the press. 
- I can help with literally anything involving writing, editing or proof-reading.
- I enjoy helping others. You can ask me anything. There are no stupid questions.
- I help engineering with marketing stuff. Need content for a new feature? I'm your man.
- I can help you work with many of our customers, partners or other external parties.    

### How to work with me
- I can be over-communicative and need to be challenged on this.
- I have a very hands-on attitude and will never say 'That's not my job'.
- I'm really uncomfortable with being in the limelight. I prefer private thank yous.
- I value compassion and inclusivity above everything else. I try to put people first. 
- I struggle with anxiety and constantly feel like I am failing. Direct feedback helps me a _lot_. 

## Areas of focus - Q4 2022

Last quarter I focused on collaborating with the growth and product teams to directly contribute to product improvements (such as tutorials and activation flows), growing external communities and partnerships, and becoming more autonomous/skilled technically so that I could contribute directly to the product. These were all successful. 

This quarter I'm focusing on...

- [ ] **Onboarding:** Previously I've provided content and research to inform v1 of our onboarding flows. This quarter, I'm going to take greater ownership of onboarding by delivering improvements to our emails, as well as continuing to work with Growth on improving in-product activation. 
- [ ] **Announcements:** We have some specific things we want to announce, such as EU Cloud. We also have regular announcements, such as Array. In addition to taking ownership of the former, I'll also find ways to directly improve the latter. A static page for Array? In-app announcements for new features? Better emails? Whatever is needed. 
- [ ] **Word of mouth growth:** We're starting to get a more detailed view of where our WOM growth comes from. I'll spend time scaling this growth with the marketing team. This could involve a referral program, influencers or levelling up and/our case studies. Maybe all of the above.
- [ ] **Product design:** This is a personal goal. I'm switching from just-in-case to just-in-time technical learning and focusing on improving my knowledge of product design instead. The goal is to become more effective when providing feedback and when planning in-product proposals. Good thing [we have a generous book budget](/handbook/people/training#books). 

This list is not exhaustive and is meant to guide the sort of work I do at a high level. If something more important comes up where I'll have more impact? Pivoting is fine. 

## Feedback
In past feedback sessions I've been told that I'm an effective communicator and executor, that others recognise how I default to transparency and that I show bravery in how vulernable and direct I am with feedback. I've had especially positive feedback recently about work I do with external parties and customers, and my ability to take ownership of large projects. 

I've previously used forms to gather feedback from engineering teams. These teams have given me positive feedback on my ability to prioritize and to give thoughtful, detailed feedback on the product. PostHog team members can [read notes about this from my previous career chat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCx1FLsc8gbH4x9oML8RcoNlA-KLYS3WBcCh9eP2f88/edit?usp=sharing) for more info. 

Constructively I've had feedback that, because I generate a lot of ideas, the 'wilder' ideas can often overshadow the more thoughtful and impactful concepts. I've also had consistent feedback that I can be overcommunicative and that, when giving feedback, I default to detailed line edits rather than big picture ideas. As a result I'm currently trying to communicate more conscisely, especially when I'm between major projects and hunting for areas of focus. 

I'm always open to more feedback, from anyone. Got some? [Send it to me](https://forms.gle/UcA5FdAjZJSXiqYG6)!

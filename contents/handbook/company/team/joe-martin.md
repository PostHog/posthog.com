# Bio

[This is my fifth start-up](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joemartinwords/). 

Before I took up Product Marketing I was a Content Marketer, a Copywriter and a Journalist. Before _that_ I was a clown, a chainsaw salesman and a cleaner in a morgue. I've had a strange life. 

I'm engaged and live just outside of London. I'm passionate about punk music, videogame preservation and garlic. I can't ride a bike.

You can read more about what I'm focused on in [my goals document](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/joe-martin-goals). 

# How I can help you
- I can help you figure out the right way to communicate something, to anyone, no matter how technical. 
- I can help you with a broad range of marketing tasks, including sales enablement. 
- I can help you understand our customers, our competitors or the press. 
- I can help with literally anything involving writing, editing or proof-reading. 
- I can help you find new videogames to play.

# How to work with me
- In meetings I default to listening, rather than speaking. Its rare for me to interrupt, so you may need to ask me for my thoughts if you want them.
- I fidget constantly, often without realising it. I promise I'm still listening to you, but if it bothers you then please let me know. 
- I'll sometimes repeat things back to you ('_It sounds like..._') to make sure I understand. If I'm wrong, I need you to tell me. 
- I'm truly uncomfortable with public praise or attention. A private thanks is better than a spotlight.
- I care deeply about my co-workers and trust them by default. I'm always happy to chat, about anything.
- I'm usually fine with ad-hoc meetings, even on no-meeting days, but weekends are sacred to me. Slack is the best way to reach me. I generally work 9-6 GMT, with no break for lunch.

# What I value
- Compassion and inclusivity. Anything that puts people first, really. 
- A 'no bad ideas' attitude. I don't think there's any such thing as a stupid question, even though I ask a lot of them.
- Vulnerability, especially in leaders. It's healthy and builds trust. I'm happy to be vulnerable with you too.    
- Honest feedback. I am literally always interested in hearing how I can improve.
- A hands-on attitude. I don't think I've ever said 'That's not my job'.

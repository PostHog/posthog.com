# Bio

[This is my fifth start-up](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joemartinwords/). 

Before I took up Product Marketing I was a Content Marketer, a Copywriter and a Journalist. Before _that_ I was a clown, a chainsaw salesman and a cleaner in a morgue. It's been a strange life. 

I'm engaged and live just outside of London. I'm passionate about punk music, videogame preservation and garlic. I can't ride a bike.

### How I can help you
- I can help you figure out the right way to communicate anything, to anyone. 
- I can help you with a broad range of marketing tasks, including sales enablement. 
- I can help you understand our customers, our competitors or the press. 
- I can help with literally anything involving writing, editing or proof-reading.
- I enjoy helping others. You can ask me anything. There are no stupid questions.  

### How to work with me
- I default to listening. You may need to ask for my thoughts if you want them.
- I have a very hands-on attitude and will never say 'That's not my job'. 
- I may parrot ('_It sounds like..._') to ensure I understand. If I'm wrong, tell me. 
- I'm truly uncomfortable with being in the limelight. I prefer private thank yous.
- I value compassion and inclusivity above everything else. I try to put people first. 
- Ad-hoc meetings are fine, but weekends are sacred. I generally work 9-6 GMT.

## Current areas of focus
### Execution - Q1 2022
- [ ] **Community:** Organize the first PostHog community meet-up, with a good speaker. Retro the event and roll changes into a second event. Continue to attend and report back on other community events and meet-ups.
- [ ] **Case studies:** Secure an enterprise-level case study. Enhance the Customers section of the site and make plans to better leverage this content.
- [ ] **Content:** Support the Content team in creating a decent pipeline of good content that continues to deliver.
- [ ] **Partnerships:** Find further partnership opportunities to grow the community.
- [ ] **Internal:** Continue to advocate for less technical team members and users. Become more ambitious when it comes to shipping.

### Personal - Q1 2022
- [ ] Don't lose (another, again) mission in Pandemic Legacy: Season Zero.
- [ ] See all of my nieces at least once. And my nephew.
- [ ] Don't miss a Donut chat.

## Feedback
In our last [360 feedback session](/handbook/people/feedback#full-team-feedback-sessions-1), I received feedback on the following points. 

- I am seen as an effective and flexible executor, planner, writer and storyteller.
- I am seen as empathetic and extremely supportive of others, especially new colleagues or those with less experience than me. 
- I am seen as brave when giving feedback and stepping on toes. Others recognize that I default to transparency.
- Work I do, such as [case studies](/customers), is seen as valuable and showing a lot of insight.
- I am seen as over-cautious and too detail-orientated when planning new work. 
- I am seen as over-communicative in social discussions. I talk a lot about diversity, but fail on follow-through.
- I am seen as biased to my past experiences. This limits my potential impact.

As a result, over the next six months I will:

- Push for bigger, braver projects. I feel continuing the '[Nail Plugins](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/3265)' project is a good starting point, as well as unblocking [competitor comparisons](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/2939).
- Default to giving only high-level feedback on content, unless requested to do more. 
- Change my internal communication style to allow other voices more room. Actively seek opportunities to champion diversity at PostHog through action. 

I'm always open to more feedback, from anyone. Got some? [Send it to me!](https://forms.gle/UcA5FdAjZJSXiqYG6)

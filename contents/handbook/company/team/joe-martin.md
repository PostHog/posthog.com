# Bio

[This is my fifth start-up](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joemartinwords/). 

Before I took up Product Marketing I was a Content Marketer, a Copywriter and a Journalist. Before _that_ I was a clown, a chainsaw salesman and a cleaner in a morgue. It's been a strange life. 

I live just outside of London. I'm passionate about punk music, videogame preservation and garlic. I can't ride a bike.

### How I can help you
- I can help you figure out the right way to communicate anything, to anyone. 
- I can help you with a broad range of marketing tasks, including sales enablement. 
- I can help you understand our customers, our competitors or the press. 
- I can help with literally anything involving writing, editing or proof-reading.
- I enjoy helping others. You can ask me anything. There are no stupid questions.  

### How to work with me
- I can be over-communicative and need to be challenged on this. Tell me if you want the short version.
- I have a very hands-on attitude and will never say 'That's not my job'. 
- I may parrot ('_It sounds like..._') to ensure I understand. If I'm wrong, tell me. 
- I'm truly uncomfortable with being in the limelight. I prefer private thank yous.
- I value compassion and inclusivity above everything else. I try to put people first. 
- Ad-hoc meetings are fine, but weekends are sacred. I generally work 9-6 GMT.

## Areas of focus - Q2 2022

In Q1 I focused on our internal community, content and partnerships, among other things. Among the milestones I set were organizing our first meet-up, securing an enterprise-scale case study, launching the Apps platform and leading partnerships with other orgs. These were all successful.

In Q2, I'm focusing on the following areas:

- [ ] **Growth & Product:** Spend more time working with the Growth, Design and Engineering teams to have a direct impact on the product. Join Engineering sprints to find opportunities to collaborate. 
- [ ] **Technical skills:** Continue to [improve technical skills and become more capable of shipping changes](https://posthog.com/blog/a-non-coders-thoughts-on-everybody-codes-culture-part-two) autonomously. Make changes directly to the product.  
- [ ] **Scaling impact:** Find opportunities that, like Apps and onboarding, are especially impactful for users. Deprioritize sunk cost projects, such as Marketplace. Default to high-level content feedback over line-edits.
- [ ] **Community activation:** Focus on opportunities to grow word of mouth by activating PostHog's community outside of Slack and GitHub. Example: G2 reviews, referral programmes, partnerships.  

## Feedback
In our last [360 feedback session](/handbook/people/feedback#full-team-feedback-sessions-1), I received feedback on the following points. 

- I am seen as an effective and flexible executor, planner, writer and storyteller.
- I am seen as empathetic and extremely supportive of others, especially new colleagues or those with less experience than me. 
- I am seen as brave when giving feedback and stepping on toes. Others recognize that I default to transparency.
- Work I do, such as [case studies](/customers), is seen as valuable and showing a lot of insight.
- I am seen as over-cautious and too detail-orientated when planning new work. 
- I am seen as over-communicative in social discussions. I talk a lot about diversity, but fail on follow-through.
- I am seen as biased to my past experiences. This limits my potential impact.

A few months later, I had my [career chat](/handbook/people/career-progression) with Marcus and gathered additional feedback. PostHog team members can [read notes from this conversation and summary of the feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCx1FLsc8gbH4x9oML8RcoNlA-KLYS3WBcCh9eP2f88/edit?usp=sharing) for more info. 

I'm always open to more feedback, from anyone. Got some? [Send it to me!](https://forms.gle/UcA5FdAjZJSXiqYG6)

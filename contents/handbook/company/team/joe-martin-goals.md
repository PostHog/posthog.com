This is a non-exhaustive list of things I'm currently trying to accomplish. It's likely that ad-hoc tasks or other priorities will appear to alter these and that's OK. For information on how I like to work, refer to [my README](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/joe-martin). 


### Execution - Q4 2021
- **Content:** Get the content pipeline working properly, with a clear content calendar. Execute against the content strategy, set the Technical Content Marketer up for success. 
- **Landing Pages:** Work with Team Design to [get a usable landing page template made](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/2098) and create competitor landing pages, with further pages planned against the content strategy. Identify SEO opportunities with landing pages and hit some of the big ones.
- **Case studies:** Get [the customer stories section](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/1707) of the site live and continue to build on them with [Crypto and Healthcare content](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/2092). Bring case study content more into the forefront across PostHog documentation and webpages. 

### Strategic - Q4 2021
- **Content:** Ensure Team Marketing has a content strategy in place and a plan on how to deliver against it. 
- **Competitors & Churn:** Invest time in competitor analysis and churned customer feedback, using discoveries to influence other teams and improve messaging. Focus on up-and-coming competitors where possible. 
- **Advocate:** Continue to advocate for changes which support less technical team members and users. 

### Personal - Q4 2021
- Don't lose (another) mission in [Pandemic: Season Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_game). 
- Make basic [climate change-focused improvements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Prepare_for_Climate_Change) to the house.
- Get back into a good fitness routine with a new personal trainer.

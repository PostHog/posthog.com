This is a non-exhaustive list of things I'm currently trying to accomplish. It's likely that ad-hoc tasks or other priorities will appear to alter these and that's OK. For information on how I like to work, refer to [my README](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/joe-martin). 


### Execution - Q1 2022
- **Community:** Organize the first PostHog community meet-up, with a good speaker. Retro the event and roll changes into a second event. Continue to attend and report back on other community events and meet-ups. 
- **Case studies:** Secure an enterprise-level case study. Enhance the Customers section of the site and make plans to better leverage this content. 
- **Content:** Support the Content team in creating a decent pipeline of good content that continues to deliver. 
- **Marketing Partnerships:** Find further partnership opportunities around content, community events and other marketing activities. 
- **Internal:** Continue to advocate for changes which support less technical team members and users. Become more ambitious when it comes to shipping; help other less technical team members to ship faster. Make more mistakes in public. 

### Personal - Q1 2022
- Don't lose (another, again) mission in [Pandemic Legacy: Season Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_game). 
- See all of my nieces at least once. And my nephew.  
- Make something out of wood. Something _cool_.
- Don't miss a Donut chat.

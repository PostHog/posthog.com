## Bio

Hi, I'm Eltje (_pronounced Elt-ie_), originally from Northern Germany, I moved to the UK in 2017 and I am now based in East London.

In my previous life, I used to be a professional cyclist. This time has been hugely influential for me - from a very young age I have been around people from all over the world. I am also very driven and I usually juggle a million things at the same time (which is often to the detriment of my mental health). 

After a short identity crisis after quitting cycling, I started university with the goal to become a management consultant. That never happened, I luckily realised my skills and personality are much better suited in a people (I guess non-startup people call it HR) role.

Over the last 7 years, I had the honour to work with some of the most exciting startups and scale-ups in Europe. Before joining PostHog,  I worked in a very similar role at a startup called [Farewill](https://farewill.com/), who offer services around death (yes, you read right). Prior to that, I worked for a couple of companies later in their scaling journey, like [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/) and [Xing](https://xing.com/).

Outside of work, I am working on my [Masterchef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterChef) skills and you can usually find me outdoors - either on my bike or during a long walk.


## My role

I look after everything that has to do with the team - all hiring, people-related initiates as well as the culture here at PostHog. 

My personal goal is to scale the team in a sustainable way and create an environment where everyone feels like they belong and can genuinely be themselves, while also developing in their career. 

Also, as someone who went through a period of burnout, I made it my personal mission that none of my colleagues have to go through this. 


## What I value the most

*   Radical Candor - I always aim to give feedback straight away, and I expect the same from people around me. 
    *   I have received feedback in the past that I am intimidating to give feedback to. I am currently working on finding a better way to communicate why I might push back on certain feedback. 
*   Honesty, openness and vulnerability - [Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com/) is one of the people I look up to the most 
*   Like [Charles](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/charles-cook), I can get frustrated if people don't move as quickly as I like to. 
*   Proactiveness 
*   Transparency - obviously! 
*   I hugely value respectful discourse. Having people around me from different backgrounds, with different lived experiences and opinions, is one of the experiences I value the most. 
*   I am also someone who needs the occasional nudge, when I get too comfortable in my comfort zone. 

## Quirks

*   My attention to detail needs work. By juggling a few too many things, I often make mistakes. 
*   I do a lot of context switching, which can get very tiring. If you catch me towards the end of my working day, the chances are high that my energy levels are a bit lower. 
*   My Slack status usually indicates what I am currently doing. I am less responsive when the status is on ‘focus time’ or calls. Otherwise, I’ll usually get back to people relatively quickly. 
*   I hate unread notifications and I archive emails if there is no to do for me. If you message me, the lower the amount of individual notifications, the better.
*   I use grammarly a lot. Unfortunately, grammarly doesn’t work on Markdown. I often pre-write things on google docs and use an add-on to translate it into markdown. _If you spot a mistake, it would be great if you could just correct it, instead of writing a comment to point it out. Better use of time and headspace!_
*   I don’t have Slack on my phone, so when I’m off, I’m off!

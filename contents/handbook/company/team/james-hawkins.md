## Bio

I'm from Cambridge in the UK.

I started off as a bad professional cyclist, became a worse developer, bootstrapped an online marketing company, wound up as a VP Sales at an enterprise software company, then got into YC where PostHog was born.

I tend to work 9am to 5pm with an hour for lunch, then I have a gap to have dinner with my family, then 9pm to around 11pm ish.

## Areas of responsibility

- Make sure we've always enough money to think long term
- Make sure we have exceptional people working here
- Make sure we have a clear direction

## Quirks

- I speak really fast and hop around a lot. I've tried to fix this before but it led to me focussing more on polish than the topic at hand - a tradeoff that I felt wasn't worth it. If you leave a conversation without clarity with me, get me in written form instead. If you ever can't understand my opinion or feel a lack of clarity, ask me in written form or call me out on it verbally.
- Sometimes I can end up bottlenecking stuff by being indecisive. Call me out on this.
- I'm a little disorganized. I compensate for this by making sure the teams I work on have this skill. Often I think this actually helps me prioritize the things that really matter.
- If I haven't responded to something that you've sent me, that's probably because I've read it and don't feel particularly strongly - so just make a call on what to do if you don't hear back in a reasonable time frame.
- I'm an optimist and I'm level headed. If you've got bad news, I am never going to get mad

## What I value

- Proactivity. Do not ask me for permission to do things - I wouldn't have hired you if I didn't trust you. I'd rather 9 things get done well and 1 thing I disagree with than we don't get anything done at all. 
- People who get things done without me having to chase. I love it if we mention something should get done and there's a PR for it the next day.
- People who solve frustrations they have with other people (or with projects / tasks) directly. I won't mediate your relationship with someone else - I'll ask you to speak to them directly. 
- Iteration over analysis. Analysis is valuable but it should be _very_ quick and intense.
- Speed. It's much easier to get things right if you take more shots at goal. Let's just get something up and iterate on it.
- Directness impresses me. If you don't like something please just say so. It makes for much healthier relationships.
- I'm anti meeting by default.

## How you can help me

- Come to 1:1s with an agenda and clear things I can help with
- Ship :) Lots of things will be on fire in a startup all the time. Make sure you're moving the needle every week.

## My goals until August 6th

I'm going into tactical mode as we're working on deepening product market fit for our paid product, as part of our short term strategy to Nail Funnels.

### Strategy
- Make sure we have product market fit with our focus segment
- Do nothing else
### Execution - in next 6 weeks I want:
- Work to onboard existing users properly to turn them into 5 reference customers
  - Get meetings / build relationships with them in order to make sure they’re up and running with funnels properly (activation is defined clearly, they’re using us for the list of “jobs to be done” that we’re supposed to be enabling.
  - Clear pricing model
  - Internal guidance on what is free versus paid
- Sustain existing success
  - Get them to use funnels for the full list of jobs to be done
- Don’t get distracted outside of the above
  - Make sure that my direct reports have goals that they can focus on autonomously
- Personal
  - Do 1 bike ride a week
  - Exchange on house

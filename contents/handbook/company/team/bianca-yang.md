## Bio

San Diego > LA > SF Bay Area. Doesn't look like I'm leaving California anytime soon. 

Cook and bake a lot in phases...I had tried to sell toffee and apple cider caramels at some point. Let me know if you want samples.

Have been in startups my whole life; love working with small teams and seeing the direct impact of my work.

## Areas of responsibility

Making things [grow](/teams/growth) w/ [Raquel](/raquel).

## Quirks
- I tend to be quiet to a fault in larger groups. I contribute much more and feel more comfortable in smaller group formats. It can be effective to directly call on me to contribute in larger meetings.
- I can sometimes be too invested in figuring out things on my own and take more time than necessary on tasks. Feel free to give me a tap on my shoulder to help me reprioritize or to simply help me get a task done.
- Please don't send "hey" / "hi" Slack messages ðŸ˜¡. Try to include as much context as possible within your initial message.
- I prefer to cluster my meetings together though this can sometimes lead to bleed between meetings or meeting overload after a couple hours of consecutive meetings.
- I like pair-programming and prefer using Slack huddles over more formal meeting software like Google Meet or Zoom.
- Give me lots of feedback!!

If your team doesn't have a dedicated designer, create an [issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues), add the label `design`, and add it to the relevant team's project board. There's no need for a separate issue for the design request - just assign the relevant board. (This gives us full context of the problem.)

In the issue should be details about what you need from a product designer:

1. Have you provided sufficient context for the problem you're trying to solve?
2. Are there any technical constraints to be aware of?
3. Is there any user feedback or other qualitative data that can inform the problem?
4. How soon do you need a solution?
5. Do you have success criteria documented?

If there isn’t a clear deadline for your design request, we’ll prioritize according to our availability.

### When to loop in design

Because we hire self-starters, there is no expectation that every project should start by running through design _first_. If you are contributing design, be sure to consult the [contribution guidelines](/handbook/company/contributing-to-product-design)

Depending on your preferred workflow, there are different ways we can get involved.

_The scenarios below largely pertain to work on the main PostHog app._

**If you built something and just need some polish...**

Feel free to share a link (or screenshot) of what you've built. We can provide UX or design feedback for your consideration.

**If you built something and realize it needs some UX love...**

Share a link (or screenshot) of what you've built. Depending on the state of the project, we can either go back to the wireframe stage to rethink some things, or figure out a phased approach to incremental improvement.

**If you designed your own wireframes or mocks...**

Sometimes if you have domain knowledge or have been thinking about a project for a while, it might make more sense for you to start the design process. Feel free to share with us for a second opinion, or if you think certain UIs or flows are suboptimal.

**If you'd like some design help before you break ground...**

More like a typical product development process, please share the high level goals or spec, or any other documentation you have about a feature or enhancement. Be sure to specify the line between MVP and nice-to-haves.

**Need help brainstorming a flow?**

Provide as much documentation about the goals of the project. Depending on the project, we may be able to sketch out some ideas and share in the GitHub issue.

In some cases, it may make sense to jump on a Zoom to sketch out some ideas together.

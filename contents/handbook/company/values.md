We think of the company as a product, not just the software we're building. This is what we *currently* value in how we operate - this may evolve as we grow. 

## We are open source

Building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to [PostHog's strategy](/handbook/strategy/strategy).

We default to transparency with everything we work on. That means we make public our handbook, [our roadmap](/handbook/strategy/roadmap), [how we pay](/handbook/people/compensation) (or even [let go of](/handbook/people/offboarding)) people, [what our strategy is](/handbook/strategy/strategy), and [who we have raised money from](/handbook/strategy/investors). Internally, we go even further - providing financial information, live updates on fundraising and board slide access.

This enables the strongest community growth possible. It causes the core team to raise the bar on their work, it provides the context needed for people to work across multiple timezones, and it enables a deep work-heavy and meeting-light culture. It creates trust.

## We haven't built our defining feature yet

We will never stop iterating.

You learn faster, and thus help PostHog perform better by getting what you're working on into the real world. We expect you to ship new designs, features or whatever is needed for your role in tiny chunks, frequently, and often before you feel ready.

## Everyone codes

...although this doesn't mean everyone has to be a software developer, and not everyone needs experience in this before they join.

Our platform is built for developers, and we use GitHub to build a large community of technical users. Being able to do the basics of shipping, no matter your role, helps understand the people who we're building for and it helps empower teams outside of engineering with greater context.

Whether you're a designer or you're in operations, we will encourage and help you to be able to make basic changes to our website and docs on GitHub.

## Step on toes

PostHog is driven by context-based leadership. We'll explain what we need to achieve, but the reason we hire the best people is that they know how to get us there.

We expect you to pick out the very most important thing you can think of, and work on that. It is *not* ok to follow instructions blindly - not that you're likely to receive instructions in any case. We judge your performance based on the results you deliver overall. You'll make a lot of mistakes along the way - and that's ok! What matters is that you're making mistakes quickly, iterating, and getting better over time.

## Talent compounds

Getting into PostHog is a huge challenge. Once you're here, it stays that way. We are *extremely* demanding of performance.

In return, you get to work with others producing the best work of their careers.

We are a team, not a family. This means we have very ambitious goals, [pay top of market](/handbook/people/compensation), offer [exceptional benefits](/handbook/people/benefits), and do everything we can to provide an environment for you to do your best work. Often this means everyone, [especially managers](/handbook/company/management), getting out of your way. It's also [not ok to let your teammates fail](/handbook/company/culture/#dont-let-others-fail). We expect everyone to provide direct feedback, to help everyone perform at their best. We pay [generous severance](/handbook/people/compensation#severance) if things aren't working out.

## Bias for impact

Think a change should be made? Then make it.

Most decisions are reversible, so a (slow) consensus-building culture is suboptimal. We'll perform better by taking 2 rapid steps forward, and 1 back, then not progressing at all.

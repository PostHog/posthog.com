## We are open source

We work all remote, from all over the world.

We default to transparency and we share what we're working on, in writing.

This means that everyone has more context to help the company achieve its goals.

##Â We haven't built the defining feature yet

The stronger we make our product/market fit, then everything else will be easier.

## Everyone ships

This has a few meanings.

## Tread on toes

If you need to drop what you're doing and do something else, do it.

PostHog is driven by context-based leadership. We'll explain what we need to achieve, but the reason we hire the best people is that they know what to do.

## Talent compounds

Getting into PostHog is a huge challenge. Once you're here, it stays that way. We are *extremely* demanding of performance.

In return, you get to work with others producing the best work of their careers. We are a team, not a family - we pay top of market and give generous severance.

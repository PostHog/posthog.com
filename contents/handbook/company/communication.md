## Introduction

With team members across several countries, it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use **asynchronous communication as a starting point** and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating on GitHub through public issues and pull requests, as well as in our PostHog User and internal Slack. <!-- Are we trying to say here that we also communicate through public issues and pull requests in our PostHog User and internal Slack? The second part of this sentence "as well as... internal Slack." is a little confusing to decipher. -->

## Our Communication Values

1. **Assume Positive Intent.** Always come from a position of positivity and grace.
1. **Form An Opinion.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
1. **Feedback is Essential.** Help everyone up their game in a direct but constructive way.

## Golden rules

1. Use **asynchronous communication** when possible: pull requests (preferred) or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate Slack channels. [People should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.21t7089jk).
1. Discussion in GitHub issues or pull requests is preferred over everything else. If you need a response urgently, you can Slack someone with a link to your comment on an issue or pull request, asking them to respond there. However, be aware that they still may not see it straight away (and that's OK in our book).
1. You are not expected to be available all the time. There is **no** expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
1. It is 100% OK to ask as many questions as you have - please ask in public channels! If someone sends you a handbook link, that means they are proud that we have the answer documented - they don't mean that you should have found that yourself or that this is the complete answer. If the answer to a question isn't documented yet, please immediately make a pull request to add it to the handbook in a place you have looked for it.
1. When someone asks for something, reply back with a deadline or by noting that you already did it. Answers like: 'will do,' 'OK,' or 'it is on my to-do list' are not helpful. If it is a small task for you but will unblock someone else, consider spending a few minutes to do the task so the other person can move forward.
1. By default, avoid creating private groups for internal discussions.

## Public by default

We make things public by default because [transparency is part of Communication, one of our values](/handbook/values/#communication). The kinds of information we share falls into one of three buckets:

- _Public_ - most things, including our product, roadmap, handbook and strategy. 
- _Shared internally_ - almost everything else, such as financial performance, security, fundraising and recruitment.
- _Private internally_ - personal team information, i.e. compensation, disciplinary issues.

Information that is not publicly shared is in areas with complex signals that can impact our ability to sell, raise money or are inappropriate to share more widely for personal privacy reasons.

## Written Communication

### GitHub

#### Everything Starts with a Pull Request

Where possible, it's best practice to start a discussion with a Pull Request (PR) instead of an issue. A PR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. The nature of PRs facilitates discussions around a proposed solution to a problem that is actionable. A PR is actionable, while an issue will inevitably lead to a longer period before the problem is addressed.

Always open a PR for things you are suggesting and/or proposing. Whether something is not working right or we are iterating on a new internal process, it is worth opening a pull request with the Minimal Viable Change (MVC) <!-- For clarity's sake, it's a good idea to explain what is meant by "minimal viable change," as this could mean different things depending on who is reading it. --> instead of opening an issue encouraging open feedback on the problem without directly proposing any specific change. Remember, a PR also invites discussion specific to the proposed change, which facilitates focused decisions.

By default, pull requests are **non-confidential**. As such, please open a confidential issue with suggestions to specific changes that you are proposing for things that are not public. When possible, consider not including sensitive information so the wider community can contribute.

Not every solution will solve the problem at hand. Keep discussions focused by _defining the problem first_ and _explaining your rationale_ behind the MVC proposed in the PR. Have a bias for action and don't aim for consensus - some improvement is better than none. <!-- Could we clarify what is meant by "having a bias for action?" While it's a good phrase, it would be helpful to maybe expand on its meaning. -->

#### Issues

GitHub Issues are useful when there isn't a specific code change that is being proposed or needed. For example, you may want to start an issue for tracking progress or for project management purposes that do not pertain to code commits. Issues can be particularly useful when tracking team tasks and creating issue boards.

However, it is still important to maintain focus when opening issues by defining a single specific topic of discussion and the desired outcome that would resolve the issue. The point is to not keep issues open-ended, preventing them from going stale due to lack of resolution. For example, a team member may open an issue to track a blog post's progress with associated to-do items that need to be completed by a certain date (e.g., first draft, peer review, publish). Once the specific items are completed, the issue can successfully be closed.

### Slack

Slack is used for more informal communication or for where it doesn't make sense to create an issue or pull request. Use your judgment to determine the appropriate channel and whether you should be chatting publicly (default) or privately.

### Google Docs and presentations

Never use a Google Doc / presentation for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or this handbook. Work on these edits via commits to a pull request, then link to the pull request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out-of-date handbook.

We mainly use Google Docs to capture internal information, like meeting notes, or to share company updates and metrics. We always make the doc accessible so you <!-- It might be good to clarify who we mean by "you" in this sentence. A PostHog employee? A GitHub contributor? One of our investorys? -->can comment and ask questions.

Please avoid using presentations for internal use. They are a poor substitute for a discussion on an issue. They lack depth and don't add enough context to enable asynchronous work.

### Email

1. Internal email should be avoided in nearly all cases. Use GitHub for feature / product discussion, using Slack if you cannot use GitHub, and Google Docs for anything else.
1. The only uses we have for internal email are for:
    - Obtaining approvals for legal things
    - Sending some types of more official company documents (e.g., job offers, payroll forms)
    - Communicating with external partners

### Writing Style

1. We use American English as the standard written language in our public-facing comms, including this handbook.
1. Do not use acronyms when you can avoid them. Acronyms have the effect of excluding people from the conversation if they are not familiar with a particular term.
1. We use the [Oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/).
1. Do not create links like "here" or "click here." All links should have relevant anchor text that describes what they link to. Using meaningful links is important to both search engine crawlers (SEO) and people with accessibility issues.

## Internal Meetings

PostHog uses [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for video communications. Zoom also has useful plugins for [Google Calendar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-scheduler/kgjfgplpablkjnlkjmjdecgdpfankdle?hl=en-US) and Slack which you may wish to use.

Use video calls if you find yourself going back and forth, whether in an issue, via email, or over chat. Sometimes it is still more valuable to have a 40+ message conversation via chat as it improves transparency, is easy to refer back to, and is friendlier to newcomers getting up to speed.

1. Most scheduled meetings should have a Google Doc linked or a relevant GitHub issue. This contains an agenda and includes any necessary preparation materials.
1. Please click 'Guests can modify event' so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can configure this to be checked by default under [Event Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings).
1. Try to have your video on at all times because it's much more engaging for participants. Having pets, children, significant others, friends, and family visible during video chats is encouraged - please introduce them!
1. Use of a headset with a microphone is strongly recommended - use your company card if you need to get one.
1. Always advise participants to mute their mics if there is unnecessary background noise to ensure the speaker can be heard by all attendees.
1. Take notes of the points and to-dos during the meeting. Being able to structure conclusions and follow up actions in real-time makes a video call more effective than an in-person meeting. If it is important enough to schedule a meeting, it is important enough to take notes.
1. We start on time and do not wait for people. People are expected to join no later than the meeting's scheduled minute, and we don't spend time bringing latecomers up to speed.
1. It can feel rude in video calls to interrupt people. This is because the latency causes you to talk over the speaker for longer than during an in-person meeting. You should not be discouraged by this, as the questions and context provided by interruptions are valuable.
1. We end at the scheduled time. Again, it might feel rude to end a meeting, but you're actually allowing all attendees to be on time for their next meeting.
1. It is unusual to smoke or vape in an open office, and the same goes for video calls - please don't do this out of respect for others on the call.

For external meetings, the above is also helpful. We also have separate guidance on [how to run a great demo](/handbook/growth/sales/demos).

### Indicating Availability

1. Put your planned away time, including holidays, vacation, travel time, and other leave, in your own calendar.
1. Set your working hours in your Google Calendar - you can do this under _Settings_ > _Working Hours_. This is helpful as we work across different timezones.

### Google Calendar

We recommend setting your Google Calendar access permissions to: 'Make available for PostHog - See all event details.' Consider marking the following appointments as 'Private':

1. Personal appointments
1. Particularly confidential & sensitive meetings with third-parties outside of PostHog
1. 1-1 performance or evaluation meetings
1. Meetings on organizational changes

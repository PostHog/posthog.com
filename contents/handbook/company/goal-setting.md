## How it works

Every [small team](../people/team-structure/why-small-teams) has:

- As few objectives as possible (ideally 1)
- Motivation (explains why the objective is set)
- Key Results that show if we're en route to achieving an Objective

## Why we do this

- Sense of winning / losing - bonds teams, increases urgency and creates satisfaction when we achieve things
- Clarifies our direction

## Good goal setting

- Objectives are simple
- Objectives are ambitious - they move the needle for PostHog
- Hitting an Objective is more important than hitting any Key Results
- Key Results show we're on track to hitting the Objectives. It should be simple to know if we hit them
- Key Results are leading indicators and can be achieved quickly
- Objectives and Key Results should be timebound

Bear the following in mind:

- Don't fall into an existential crisis every time we do this exercise. Whilst Objectives and Key Results are important, they're easy to change. Iterate.
- All Key Results are bad - they have many compromisees, are fallible, easy to game or may be affected by external factors. Use the least bad Key Results
- Use counter metrics where needed (X happens, but Y shouldn't happen)
- Don't have a lot of Key Results if you can't capture everything in one. Just pick the most important one
- Don't set arbitrary Key Results that a team cannot achieve
- Don't set a Key Result that is mainly noise

## How to set goals

- James H is accountable for this happening
- Objectives are proposed by James H, supported by the Exec Team, and agreed by Small Teams
- Key Results are set by each team leader

## Goal adoption

- Exec team communicates the Objectives (1/1 with every team leader, and updates to Objectives in handbook)
- Team leaders set Key Results
- In all hands, any significant improvement/worsening of our performance against Key Results / Objectives is explained by the relevant Team Leader
- Tim and James proactively review pay every 3-4 months. **Consistently** hitting ambitious Objectives over the long term is an important factor in this process. If you miss extremely tough Objectives but still achieve great things en route, that's great.
- Goals can be changed. If a more impactful goal becomes obvious to you, you should change your goal to that.

## FAQ

### What if I don't have time to do work towards my OKRs because of X (X = customer support / urgent board reporting / something else)?

We're small. You should expect some work will fall between the cracks if you don't pick it up.

## If my team repeatedly miss objectives, what happens?

Objectives should be ambitious but achievable - we'd aim for you to hit them 50% of the time, and you should be very proud when it happens.

If your team is continuously missing objectives, they are too hard - set objectives that are possible.

> 🎨 **Need artwork?** Please request it using the [new art request template](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new/choose). Do not request artwork over Slack or email.

[Lottie](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/27881), our Illustration Lead, and [Daniel](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34810), our Production Designer, handle all requests for branding and artwork. 

They can help you with things like:

- Custom visuals for paid ad campaigns
- Blog and social media artwork
- New themed hedgehogs
- Custom CTAs and banners
- Branded merch 
- Animated UI elements

They get a lot of work requests, so they use [a request template](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new/choose) to help them prioritize. All art requests should use this template, which automatically assigns work to their project board. 

You can see what they are working on via the [Art & Brand Planning project board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/65/views/2).

To establish a clear connection between the task and the working file, designers will create a frame containing a link to the task. They should then add a link to that frame within the task for easy reference.

Lottie and Daniel usually ask for two weeks minimum notice, but can often work faster on things if needed. If your request is genuinely urgent, please share your request issue in [#team-marketing channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C08CG24E3SR) and mention Lottie, Daniel, and/or [Cory](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/30200).

## Hedgehog library

For team members we keep all our currently approved hedgehogs [in this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/I0VKEEjbkKUDSVzFus2Lpu/Hoggies?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=H3ElmuzbLMFp4qP7-0). This enables us to look through the library of approved hogs, and to export them at required sizes without relying on the design team.

Here's how:
1. Open the Figma file. You can manually browse, or use `Cmd + F` to search based on keywords such as 'happy', 'sad', or 'will smith'.
2. Select the hog you want. If needed, adjust the size using the 'Frame' menu in the top of the right-hand sidebar. 
3. At the bottom of the right-hand sidebar, select the file type you need in the 'Export' menu, choose `@2x`, then select 'Export [filename]' to download the image.

If you can't find a suitable hog, you can [request one from the design team](/handbook/brand/art-requests). 

> Non-team members can find some of the most-used hogs to download on [our press page](/media).

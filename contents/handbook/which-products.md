Providing all the tools in one is a core part of our strategy.

Shipping them in the right order is key to a fast return on investment from every new product.

Products we build into the platform should:

* Be a product that our ICP already uses, and there already is a $1bn competitor in the market.

* Improve our other products – for example, by using or adding to customer or product data.

* Help customers build more successful products. This doesn't _just_ mean writing code, it means commercial stuff too.

* Work with our SDKs so customers can switch on new functionality immediately.

* Be easy to get a lot of customers using, either new or existing

* Solve web or mobile product engineering problems

[This diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMF-MT74=/?share_link_id=847485164707) shows example products we could ship:

When deciding what to prioritize, we should consider:

* The strength of competitors

* Whether there is someone on the PostHog team passionate about building it

At earlier stage companies, technical founders will do _every_ role, so tools traditionally used by those further from engineering (i.e. support) are likely to get usage if built into PostHog's platform. In later stage companies, we need - for now - to remain closer to engineering tools

If we decide to build a product, we should build the version that gets adopted _earliest_, to avoid having to rip and replace an existing solution. For example, we are currently working on a data warehouse. We need this to work for people who have _not_ already got a warehouse set up – it needs to be inexpensive and simple.

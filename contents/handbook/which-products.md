Providing all the tools in one is a core part of our strategy.

Shipping them in the right order is key to a fast return on investment from every new product.

Products we build into the platform should:

* Be recognizable/positioned as products that our ICP already uses. We don't want to ship a new product unless it already has product market fit somewhere else. * Improve our other products - for example, by using or adding to customer or product data
* Be designed to enable us to get in first with that product (even if in practise we often rip and replace an existing product)
* Help customers build more successful products (this doesn't _just_ mean writing code, it means commercial stuff too).
* Work with our snippet, so customers can switch on new functionality immediately.

Rough and non exhaustive examples of products we could ship:

* Product stack = product tours, feedback and surveys, analytics, recordings, roadmap, beta management (self-serve feature flags), user interviewing, alerting
* Engineering stack = feature flags, error handling, APM
* Growth stack = experimentation, session recordings, funnels, lead scoring, revenue (and integration)
* Data stack = warehouse, CDP / etl / reverse etl, transformations, monitoring and observability, data governance, ML and DS tooling, headless analytics
* BI stack = notebooks, querying, visualizations, forecasting
* Marketing stack = heatmaps, scrollmaps, attribution and performance, messaging, community and referral

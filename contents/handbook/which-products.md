Providing all the tools in one is a core part of our strategy.

Shipping them in the right order is key to a fast return on investment from every new product.

Products we build into the platform should:

* be recognizable/positioned as products that our ICP already uses. We don't want to ship a new product unless it already has product-market fit somewhere else.
* improve our other products - for example, by using or adding to customer or product data.
* be designed to enable us to get in first with that product (even if in practice we often rip and replace an existing product).
* help customers build more successful products. (This doesn't _just_ mean writing code, it means commercial stuff too.)
* work with our snippet, so customers can switch on new functionality immediately.

Rough and non-exhaustive examples of products we could ship:

* **Product stack** = product tours, feedback and surveys, analytics, recordings, roadmap, beta management (self-serve feature flags), user interviewing, alerting
* **Engineering stack** = feature flags, error handling, APM
* **Growth stack** = experimentation, session recordings, funnels, lead scoring, revenue (and integration)
* **Data stack** = warehouse, CDP / ETL / reverse ETL, transformations, monitoring and observability, data governance, ML and DS tooling, headless analytics
* **BI stack** = notebooks, querying, visualizations, forecasting
* **Marketing stack** = heatmaps, scrollmaps, attribution and performance, messaging, community and referral

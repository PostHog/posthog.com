Providing all the tools in one is a core part of our strategy.

Shipping them in the right order is key to a fast return on investment from every new product.

Products we build into the platform should:

* Be recognizable/positioned as products that our ICP already uses. We don't want to ship a new product unless it already has product market fit somewhere else. * Improve our other products - for example, by using or adding to customer or product data
* Be designed to enable us to get in first with that product (even if in practise we often rip and replace an existing product)
* Help customers build more successful products (this doesn't _just_ mean writing code, it means commercial stuff too).
* Work with our snippet, so customers can switch on new functionality immediately.

At earlier stage companies, technical founders will do _every_ role, so tools traditionally used by those further from engineering (ie support) are likely to get usage if built into PostHog's platform. In later stage companies, we need - for now - to remain closer to engineering tools

If we decide to build a product, we should build the version that gets adopted _earliest_, to avoid having to rip and replace an existing solution. For example, we are currently working on a data warehouse. We need this to work for people that have _not_ already got a warehouse set up - it needs to be inexpensive and simple.

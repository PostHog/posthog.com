We have one of the coolest [changelogs](/changelog) on the internet. It's also one of the busiest. 

As a company that ships weirdly fast, it's important to share what we're working on with as many people as possible, as often as possible. The changelog is a great way to do that.

## Changelog content and ownership

Technically speaking, the changelog is a stream of content that's published across multiple channels. 

From start to finish, a changelog entry is:

1. Posted in the `#changelog` Slack channel
2. Published on the [website](/changelog) by <SmallTeam slug="docs-wizard" />
3. Produced into a [video](/changelog) by <SmallTeam slug="youtube" />
4. And then sent in an [email](/handbook/brand/email-comms) by <SmallTeam slug="marketing" />

The **engineer** is responsible for making sure their feature appears in the `#changelog` Slack channel and writing the initial draft (details below). 

This page mainly covers the first two steps. 

<CalloutBox type="fyi" title="Website team">

The changelog code and data (stored in our Strapi CMS) is mainatined by the <SmallTeam slug="website" />. To learn more about how the features work, check out their [roadmap](handbook/engineering/posthog-com/roadmap) and [changelog](handbook/engineering/posthog-com/changelog) handbook pages.

</CalloutBox>

## What gets included

New features! But changelog entries can also include beta launches, UX improvements, or performance improvements.

For engineers, here's the rule of thumb: if you think an update (small or big) is worth sharing with users, it's probably worth posting about in the changelog.

## How the publishing process works

We have an end-to-end process for moving shipped features into the website changelog.

1. An engineer merges a `feat` PR into the monorepo or rolls out a feature flag. 
2. Relay workflows are triggered, which classify and summarize the PR or flag.
3. The feature is automatically posted in the `#changelog` Slack channel if classified as "impactful" by the workflow.
4. The PR author or engineer is tagged in the Slack thread.
5. The **engineer** writes the initial changelog draft (2-3 sentences and screenshots) and replies to the thread.
6. At the end of every week, the <SmallTeam slug="docs-wizard" /> team reviews the `#changelog` channel, compiles the entries, edits them, and then publishes to the [/changelog](/changelog) page.

Anyone can manually post in the `#changelog` Slack channel if something is worth sharing but isn't captured by the automated workflow.

## How to publish changelog yourself

People are encouraged to self-serve and publish changelog entries. Here's how. 

<CalloutBox type="fyi" title="Authentication">

You must be logged into your posthog.com account. Only website moderators (a.k.a PostHog employees) are permitted to publish changelog entries.

</CalloutBox>

### Option 1: The main changelog

Go to the [/changelog](/changelog) page and click the **+** button in the top right corner. 

<ProductVideo 
  videoLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/video/upload/changelog_form_c7f3d3a351.mp4"
  alt="Changelog form"
  classes="rounded"
/>

Fill out the changelog form and click **Create** to publish. 

The changelog entry will appear on the website on the ***next website build***, which is usually when a PR is merged into the master branch.

| Field | Required | Recommended value |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Title | **Yes** | The title of the changelog entry. Keep it short and sweet. |
| Description | **Yes** | The description with native Markdown support. Add screenshots or gifs here. |
| Hero image | No | We leave this empty. We add images in the description field for more control. |
| Status | **Yes** | It must be set to `Complete` to appear in the changelog. |
| Date | **Yes** | The completed date of the changelog entry. |
| Team | **Yes** | The team that shipped the feature. |
| Author | No | We normally leave this blank because we pull in GitHub PR metadata which includes author and reviewers. |
| Product or feature | **Yes** | The category or product area of the feature. Select `Uncategorized` if nothing fits. |
| Type | **Yes** | Set to `New feature` for most changelog entries. |
| GitHub URLs | **Yes** | It's technically optional, but the GitHub URL populates the changelog entry with the feature's PR metadata. |
| Category | **Yes** | The product category of the changelog entry. |
| Show on homepage | No | Always set the toggle to off or no. |

### Option 2: The product changelogs

Each product has a dedicated changelog page in their docs that filters entries from the main changelog. You can also publish directly from these pages using the **+ Add changelog** button.

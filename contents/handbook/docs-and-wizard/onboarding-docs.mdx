Onboarding docs are special because these instructions are **shared** between the [in-app onboarding](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding) flow and the getting started pages on the [posthog.com website](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com). These are the first pieces of docs a new user will see, so they need to be up to date and accurate. 

To help keep in-app and website onboarding docs in sync, there is a **single source** of truth for the onboarding docs in the [`posthog/posthog`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) repository under the [`docs/onboarding`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding) directory. This means you only need to update the in-app onboarding docs in the `posthog/posthog` repository, and the website docs will be updated automatically.

### Which products have shared onboarding docs

This is a relatively new feature, so we're still migrating old onboarding docs to the new system. As of December 2025:

| Product | Status |
|---------|--------|
| LLM analytics | ✅ Migrated |
| Product analytics | ✅ Migrated |
| Web analytics | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Session replay | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Feature flags | ✅ Migrated |
| Experiments | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Error tracking | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Surveys | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Data pipelines | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Data warehouse | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Revenue analytics | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| PostHog AI | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Workflows | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Logs | ⏳ Not yet migrated |
| Endpoints | ⏳ Not yet migrated | 

### How to update onboarding docs

1. Find the shared content file in the [`posthog/posthog`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) repository under [`docs/onboarding`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding). For example, `docs/onboarding/llm-analytics/openai.tsx`.
2. Edit the `.tsx` file directly in the `posthog/posthog` repository. Make your changes to the component.
3. Test locally by running the app in development mode and verifying the changes in the in-app onboarding. You can trigger onboarding by navigating to `localhost:8010/products`.
4. Commit and open a PR to merge your changes into `master` in `posthog/posthog`. This will trigger a Vercel preview build of the website. Verify these changes and merge the PR.
5. If you need more confidence, verify the website locally by setting the `GATSBY_POSTHOG_BRANCH` environment variable to your PR branch and rebuilding the website locally.
6. Verify on website: The website will automatically pull the changes on its next build.

### How to create/migrate onboarding docs

**Step 1: Create the shared component in `posthog/posthog`**

1. Navigate to the product directory in `docs/onboarding/`. If it doesn't exist, create it (e.g., `docs/onboarding/your-product/`).
2. Create a new `.tsx` file (e.g., `docs/onboarding/your-product/filename.tsx`).
3. Export a named component that contains your onboarding content. Use the `useMDXComponents` hook to access shared components:

```tsx file=docs/onboarding/llm-analytics/google.tsx
import { useMDXComponents } from 'scenes/onboarding/OnboardingDocsContentWrapper'

export const GoogleInstallation = (): JSX.Element => {
    const {
        Steps,
        Step,
        CodeBlock,
        CalloutBox,
        ProductScreenshot,
        OSButton,
        Markdown,
        Blockquote,
        dedent,
        snippets,
    } = useMDXComponents()
    
    const NotableGenerationProperties = snippets?.NotableGenerationProperties
    return (
        <Steps>
            <Step title="Install the PostHog SDK" badge="required">
                <Markdown>
                    Setting up analytics starts with installing the PostHog SDK for your language. LLM analytics works best with our Python and Node SDKs.
                </Markdown>

                <CodeBlock
                    blocks={[
                        {
                            language: 'bash',
                            file: 'Python',
                            code: dedent`
                                pip install posthog
                            `,
                        },
                        {
                            language: 'bash',
                            file: 'Node',
                            code: dedent`
                                npm install @posthog/ai posthog-node
                            `,
                        },
                    ]}
                />
            </Step>
            {/* ... more steps ... */}
    </Steps>
    )
}
```

4. For reusable snippets, create them in `docs/onboarding/<product>/_snippets/` (e.g., `docs/onboarding/your-product/_snippets/example-snippet.tsx`). Export a named component.
5. Create or update a scene in the `posthog/posthog` repository to import and use your new component. See [example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/sdks/llm-analytics/LLMAnalyticsSDKInstructions.tsx).
6. Test in the app by updating the in-app onboarding scene to import and use your new component. See [example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/sdks/llm-analytics/8LMAnalyticsSDKInstructions.tsx).
7. Reference existing examples in [`docs/onboarding/llm-analytics`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding/llm-analytics) for patterns.

**Step 2: Create the website stub in `posthog/posthog.com`**

1. Run a build to pull the latest from `posthog/posthog` with the `GATSBY_POSTHOG_BRANCH` environment variable set to your PR branch:
   ```bash
   pnpm clean && pnpm && GATSBY_POSTHOG_BRANCH=<your-pr-branch> pnpm start
   ```
   This will fetch the shared content into `.cache/gatsby-source-git/posthog-main-repo/docs/onboarding/`.

2. Create the MDX stub file in the appropriate docs location:
   - For installation pages: `contents/docs/<product>/installation/<name>.mdx`
   - For other pages: `contents/docs/<product>/<path>.mdx`
   - Example: `contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/openai.mdx`

3. Add frontmatter with title, `tableOfContents`, etc.:

```mdx
---
title: Your Product Installation
showStepsToc: true
tableOfContents: [
    {
        url: 'step-1',
        value: 'Step 1 title',
        depth: 1,
    },
]
---
```

4. Add the source comment at the top (after frontmatter) to track the source of the content:

```html
<!--
This page imports shared onboarding content from the main PostHog repo.
Source: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/docs/onboarding/your-product/installation.tsx
See the docs runbook for more info: https://posthog.com/handbook/docs-and-wizard/onboarding-docs
-->
```

5. Import and render the shared component:

```mdx
import { YourProductInstallation } from 'onboarding/your-product/installation.tsx'
import { OnboardingContentWrapper } from 'components/Docs/OnboardingContentWrapper'

<OnboardingContentWrapper snippets={{ ...snippets }}>
    <YourProductInstallation />
</OnboardingContentWrapper>
```

6. If you need snippets, import them and pass to the wrapper:
   - First, create snippet stubs in `contents/docs/<product>/_snippets/` (e.g., `contents/docs/llm-analytics/_snippets/example-snippet.mdx`):

```mdx
<!--
This snippet imports shared onboarding content from the main PostHog repo.
Source: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/docs/onboarding/your-product/_snippets/example-snippet.tsx
See the docs runbook for more info: https://posthog.com/handbook/docs-and-wizard/onboarding-docs
-->

import { OnboardingContentWrapper } from "components/Docs/OnboardingContentWrapper"
import { ExampleSnippet } from "onboarding/your-product/_snippets/example-snippet.tsx" // +

<OnboardingContentWrapper snippets={{ ExampleSnippet }}> // +
</OnboardingContentWrapper>
```

7. Test locally: Run `pnpm start` and verify the page renders correctly at the expected URL.
8. Commit and merge both the `posthog/posthog` and `posthog/posthog.com` PRs.

### How changes propagate to the website

1. Content is written in the `posthog/posthog` repository's [`docs/onboarding`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding) directory. This shared directory can be imported from the `posthog/posthog` repo and used in the `posthog/posthog.com` repo.
2. Onboarding scenes ([example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/sdks/llm-analytics/LLMAnalyticsSDKInstructions.tsx)) in the `posthog/posthog` repository import the shared onboarding docs. The [wrapper component](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/OnboardingDocsContentWrapper.tsx) passes snippets and components through a context to the shared onboarding docs.
3. Because component and snippet implementations differ between the app and website, the in-app onboarding docs use a [wrapper component](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/frontend/src/scenes/onboarding/OnboardingDocsContentWrapper.tsx) that renders the shared onboarding docs with the appropriate components and snippets.
4. The website uses `gatsby-source-git` to import the shared onboarding docs from the `posthog/posthog` repository. You can find them after running build in the `.cache/gatsby-source-git/posthog-main-repo/docs/onboarding` directory.
5. The website uses aliases to map the import paths to `onboarding/*` (e.g. [`onboarding/llm-analytics/google.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/google.mdx)).
6. The website uses the same [`OnboardingContentWrapper`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/src/components/Docs/OnboardingContentWrapper.tsx) component to render the onboarding docs. This wrapper passes snippets and components through a context to the shared onboarding docs. Usage example: [`onboarding/llm-analytics/google.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/google.mdx).
7. To allow for different implementations such as front matter, different titles, and additional content, the website uses MDX stubs like [`contents/docs/llm-analytics/google.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/installation/google.mdx) and snippet stubs like [`contents/docs/llm-analytics/_snippets/embedding-event.mdx`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/contents/docs/llm-analytics/_snippets/embedding-event.mdx) with comments to indicate the source of the content.

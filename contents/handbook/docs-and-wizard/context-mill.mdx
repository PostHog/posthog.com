The [context mill](https://github.com/PostHog/context-mill) gathers up-to-date content from multiple sources, packaging PostHog developer docs, prompts, and working example code into a versioned manifest, which can be shipped anywhere as a zip file.

The PostHog MCP server currently fetches the examples repo manifest and exposes it to any MCP-compatible client as resources and slash commands. This is what currently powers the PostHog [AI wizard](/handbook/docs-and-wizard/developing-the-wizard).

The context mill repo effectively acts as an assembly line for turning disparate PostHog knowledge into something portable, something AI systems can reliably consume.

You can break its context engineering flow into three main stages.

1. **Context sourcing**: The examples repo pulls from the entire PostHog developer docs, with pages delivered from posthog.com as raw Markdown. It also includes curated, hand-crafted prompts and working example apps.

2. **Context assembly**: The examples repo transforms and packages the sourced context into a zip file manifest, which is meant to be portable and self-contained. We can structure and shape the manifest however we need.

3. **Context delivery**: The examples repo creates a versioned release for the manifest, which can be consumed by any agent or MCP server as a skill or resource.

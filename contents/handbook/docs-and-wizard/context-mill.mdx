The [context mill](https://github.com/PostHog/context-mill) repo gathers up-to-date context from multiple sources, packaging developer docs, prompts, and working example code into a versioned manifest, which can be shipped anywhere.

The PostHog MCP server currently fetches the context mill repo manifest and exposes it to any MCP-compatible client as resources and slash commands. This is what currently powers the PostHog [AI wizard](/handbook/docs-and-wizard/developing-the-wizard).

The context mill effectively acts as an assembly line for turning disparate PostHog knowledge into something portable, something AI systems can reliably consume.

You can break its context engineering flow into three main stages.

1. **Context sourcing**: The context mill can pull from the entire PostHog developer docs, with pages delivered from posthog.com as raw Markdown. It also includes curated, hand-crafted prompts and working example apps.

2. **Context assembly**: The context mill transforms and packages the sourced context into a zip file manifest, which is meant to be portable and self-contained. We can structure and shape the manifest however we need.

3. **Context delivery**: The context mill creates a versioned release for the manifest, which can be consumed by any agent or MCP server as a skill or resource.

Getting the best results requires some hand-cranking and refining. Context mill packages are created using a simple declarative YAML spec, so it’s worth spending some time experimenting and tuning things until they feel right.

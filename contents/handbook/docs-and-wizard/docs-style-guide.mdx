First, you should start with two assumptions about our users:

1. They're busy and don't have time to read long docs.
2. They're not experts and don't know what we know.

This means our docs should be:

-   As short and to the point as possible.
-   Easy enough to understand so that a new user can read it and get what they need.

This style guide helps you write docs based on these assumptions.

## Voice and tone

Address the reader directly using "you" instead of "the user" or "developers".

> **Do:** "You can create an insight by clicking **New insight**"

> **Don't:** "Users can create insights"

### Use present tense

Write in present tense. Avoid future tense unless specifically discussing future events.

> **Do:** "The insight displays your data"

> **Don't:** "The insight will display your data"

### Use active voice

Active voice makes it clear who or what performs an action.

> **Do:** "PostHog captures events automatically"

> **Don't:** "Events are captured automatically by PostHog"

Exception: Use passive voice when the actor is unknown or unimportant.

> **Acceptable:** "The data is encrypted at rest"

### Be concise

Remove unnecessary words. Every sentence should add value.

> **Do:** "Click **Save**"

> **Don't:** "Now you can go ahead and click the **Save** button to save your changes"

### Avoid jargon and explain technical terms

When you must use technical terms, explain them on first use or link to a definition.

> **Do:** "Create a [cohort](/docs/data/cohorts) to analyze behavior. A cohort is a group of users who share common properties."

> **Do:** "Create a [cohort](/docs/data/cohorts)—a group of users who share common properties—to analyze behavior."

## Product terminology

### How to refer to PostHog Cloud vs self-hosted

- **PostHog**: Use by default. This refers to our cloud product. Most users are on cloud, so don't specify "Cloud" unless differentiating from self-hosted.
- **PostHog Cloud**: Only use when explicitly differentiating cloud features from self-hosted deployments.
- **Self-hosted PostHog** or **hobby deployments**: Use when referring to self-hosted installations.

> **Do:** "Go to **Insights** in the PostHog app and click **New insight**."

> **Do:** "This feature is only available in PostHog Cloud."

> **Don't:** "To create an insight in PostHog Cloud, go to the **Insights** tab."

### Product and feature names

Always capitalize PostHog product names.

## Content structure

### Start with the most important information

Lead with what readers need to know. For instructions, start with the action. For explanations, start with the definition.

> **Do:** "Click **New insight** to create an insight. Insights help you visualize your data."

> **Do:** "Cohorts are groups of users who share a property. Use them to compare behavior across segments."

> **Don't:** "Insights are a powerful way to visualize your data. They help you understand user behavior. To create one, click **New insight**."

### Use descriptive headings

Headings should clearly describe what's in the section. Use sentence case, not title case.

> **Do:** "## How to create a feature flag"

> **Don't:** "## Creating Feature Flags"

### Use short paragraphs

Keep paragraphs to 3-4 lines maximum. Break up longer content with subheadings, lists, or visual elements as needed.

### When to use bulleted lists

Use bullets for unordered items of equal importance. Default to prose when 1-2 items would be clearer as a sentence.

> **Do:**
> PostHog offers several products:
> - Product Analytics
> - Session Replay
> - Feature Flags
> - Experiments

> **Do (prose):** "You need a PostHog account and at least one event captured to get started."

> **Don't:**
> Feature flags let you:
> - Control feature rollouts

### When to use numbered lists

Use numbered lists only when sequence matters. Numbered lists are mainly used for UI instructions.

> **Do:**
> 1. Click **New insight**
> 2. Select your event
> 3. Click **Save**

### When to use tables

Use tables for comparing multiple items across multiple attributes.

> **Do:**
> | Plan | Events/month | Team members | Price |
> |------|--------------|--------------|-------|
> | Free | 1M | Unlimited | $0 |
> | Paid | 2M+ | Unlimited | $0.00031/event |

> **Don't:**
> Our plans:
> - Free: 1M events per month, unlimited team members, $0
> - Paid: 2M+ events per month, unlimited team members, $0.00031 per event

Use tables when a bulleted list isn't easy to scan.

### Avoid excessive formatting

Don't use:

- Multiple header levels in short sections
- Bold text for general emphasis in prose
- Lists when prose is clearer
- Tables for simple two-item comparisons

### When to use bold

Use bold for structured information:

- **Callout labels:** `**Note:**`, `**Important:**`, `**Warning:**`, `**Tip:**`
- **UI elements:** Button names, menu items, keyboard shortcuts
- **Definition lists:** The term in `**Term:** Description` patterns
- **Problem/Solution labels:** `**Problem:**` and `**Solutions:**` in troubleshooting docs

## Links

### Wikipedia-style internal links

Link the first mention of a PostHog term, feature, or SDK on a page to its docs page.

> **Example:** "To create an [insight](/docs/product-analytics/insights), first [capture events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events). Then, select the data you want to see."

### Link to the PostHog app

Link directly to PostHog app pages using `https://app.posthog.com/${path}`. EU Cloud users are redirected automatically.

> **Example:** "Go to the [**Insights** tab](https://app.posthog.com/insights) and click **New insight**."

### Link text

Link text should describe the destination. Avoid "click here" or "this page."

> **Do:** "See our [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/install) for instructions."

> **Don't:** "Click [this link](/docs/getting-started/install) for installation instructions."

## Formatting UI instructions

Bold all UI elements. Use exact names as they appear in the UI. Don't use quotes.

> **Do:** Click **New insight** in the **Insights** tab.

> **Don't:** Click the "New insight" button.

For multi-step flows, use ordered lists. Use `>` within a step to show hierarchy as needed:

> 1. In PostHog, navigate to **Settings** > **API keys** > **Personal API key**
> 2. Copy your API key
> 3. Paste your key

## Code blocks

### Use backticks

- **Inline code:** Use single backticks for code elements in text: `posthog.capture()`
- **Code blocks:** Use triple backticks for multi-line code

### Follow language conventions

Use the standard style conventions for each programming language:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for functions and variables, ES modules (`import`/`export`) instead of CommonJS (`require`)
- **Python**: `PascalCase` for classes, `snake_case` for functions and variables
- **HTML**: Lowercase for elements and attributes

### PostHog event and property naming

Always use `snake_case` for PostHog event and property names:

```js
posthog.capture('user_signed_up', {
    user_id: '123',
    username: 'Jane Doe',
})
```

Never use `camelCase` or `PascalCase` for event or property names.

### Show real-world examples

Use realistic examples that demonstrate actual use cases.

> **Do:**
> ```js
> posthog.capture('purchase_completed', {
>     product_id: 'prod_12345',
>     revenue: 49.99,
>     currency: 'USD'
> })
> ```

> **Don't:**
> ```js
> posthog.capture('event', {
>     property: 'value'
> })
> ```

### Comment sparingly

Only add comments when code isn't self-explanatory:

```js
// Don't show the survey if user dismissed it in the last 30 days
if (lastDismissed > Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
    return
}
```

### Magic placeholders

Use magic placeholders in code blocks. These auto-populate for logged-in users:

| Placeholder                | Description                   | Default                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `<ph_project_api_key>`     | Your PostHog project API key  | n/a                                             |
| `<ph_project_name>`        | Your PostHog project name     | n/a                                             |
| `<ph_app_host>`            | Your PostHog instance URL     | n/a                                             |
| `<ph_client_api_host>`     | Your PostHog client API host  | `https://us.i.posthog.com`                      |
| `<ph_region>`              | Your PostHog region (us/eu)   | n/a                                             |
| `<ph_posthog_js_defaults>` | Default values for posthog-js | `2025-11-30`                                    |
| `<ph_proxy_path>`          | Your proxy path               | `relay-XXXX` (last 4 digits of project API key) |

## Screenshots and media

### Screenshot requirements

To maintain consistency and clarity:

- **No user data**: Ensure no personal information is visible
- **Focus on the relevant UI**: Exclude sidebars and irrelevant interface elements
- **Use standard viewport**: Set device width to 1000-1400px in devtools
- **Use node screenshots**: Capture DOM node elements for upscaled rendering
- **Set DPR to 3**: Use device pixel ratio of 3 for 3x upscaling

### When to use videos

Use videos for:

- Multi-step workflows
- Complex interactions
- Demonstrating UI behavior

Use Screen Studio with these settings:

- Use the preset
- Remove zoom-in for clicks
- Export: MP4, 720p, 60 fps, "web" quality

## Word choice

### Use simple words

Choose simple, common words over complex alternatives:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| utilize | use |
| leverage | use |
| implement | set up, create, add |
| initiate | start |
| terminate | end, stop |
| commence | start, begin |
| subsequent | next |
| prior to | before |

### Be specific with verbs

Use precise verbs that clearly indicate the action:

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| use the API | call the API |
| work with data | query data, analyze data |
| handle errors | catch errors, log errors |
| manage users | add users, remove users, assign roles |

### Avoid these words and phrases

- **Simply, just, easily**:
  - **Don't:** "Simply add the SDK to your project."
  - **Do:** "Add the SDK to your project."

- **Please**:
  - **Don't:** "Please click **Save**."
  - **Do:** "Click **Save**."

- **Obviously, of course, clearly**:
  - **Don't:** "Of course, this only works for authenticated users."
  - **Do:** "This only works for authenticated users."

## Grammar and mechanics

### Parentheses

Avoid using parentheses for explanations or clarifications. They disrupt reading flow and make content harder to scan. Instead, use separate sentences or en dashes.

> **Do:** "Create a cohort to analyze behavior. A cohort is a group of users who share common properties."

> **Do:** "Create a cohort – a group of users who share common properties – to analyze behavior."

> **Don't:** "Create a cohort (a group of users who share common properties) to analyze behavior."

Parentheses are acceptable for:

- **Abbreviations on first use:** "Application Programming Interface (API)"
- **Optional parameters in code:** `posthog.capture(event, properties)`
- **Version numbers:** "Available in version 1.2.0 (or later)"

### Contractions

Use contractions to maintain a conversational tone.

### Oxford comma

Always use the Oxford comma in lists:

> **Do:** "PostHog offers analytics, session replay, and feature flags."

> **Don't:** "PostHog offers analytics, session replay and feature flags."

### Sentence case for headings

Use sentence case for all headings. Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns:

> **Do:** "## How to create a feature flag"

> **Don't:** "## How To Create A Feature Flag"

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers zero through nine
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Use numerals for percentages, measurements, and technical values

> **Do:** "You can create three dashboards" or "You can create 15 dashboards."

> **Do:** "Set the timeout to 30 seconds."

## Inclusive language

Use neutral, inclusive terms:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| blacklist/whitelist | blocklist/allowlist |
| sanity check | validation, verification |
| dummy value | placeholder, sample value |

## Docs components

### Steps

Use the `<Steps>` component for sequential instructions:

```mdx
<Steps>

<Step title="Install the SDK" badge="required">

Steps are automatically numbered.

</Step>

<Step title="Call the capture method" badge="required">

Write the _content_ in **markdown**.

</Step>

<Step checkpoint title="Check for events in PostHog" subtitle="Log in to your PostHog account" badge="optional">

Add checkpoints to help readers verify their progress.

</Step>

</Steps>
```

### Decision tree

Use decision trees to help users choose between 2-6 options:

```jsx
<DecisionTree
    questions={[
        {
            id: 'platform',
            question: 'What platform are you using?',
            options: [
                { value: 'web', label: 'Web' },
                { value: 'mobile', label: 'Mobile' },
            ],
        },
    ]}
    getRecommendation={(answers) => {
        // return recommendation based on answers
    }}
/>
```

### AskMax components

Use `<AskMax>` to provide in-context help:

```jsx
<AskMax
    quickQuestions={[
        'How do I mask sensitive data?',
        'Can I enable recordings only for certain users?',
        'How can I control costs?',
    ]}
/>
```

Use `<AskAIInput>` for troubleshooting sections:

```mdx
## Have a question? Ask PostHog AI

<AskAIInput placeholder="Ask about error tracking..." />
```

## Platform logos

All platform logos are centralized in `src/constants/logos.ts`. To add a new platform:

1. Upload SVG to Cloudinary
2. Add key to `src/constants/logos.ts` in camelCase
3. Reference in MDX frontmatter: `platformLogo: myPlatform`

Use consistent naming: `stripe`, `react`, `nodejs`, etc.

## Debugging MDX issues

Common MDX parsing issues:

- Avoid deep indentation – stay at 2 spaces or less
- Add line breaks after opening JSX tags and before closing tags
- Ensure all components are imported correctly
- Empty lines must be completely empty, no spaces
- Snippets can't share file names

Run the formatter to catch issues:

```bash
pnpm format:docs
```

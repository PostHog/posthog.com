This guide outlines how to structure product documentation, based on patterns from [Error Tracking](/docs/error-tracking). Use this as a reference when building docs for new products or improving existing ones.

## Directory structure

This structure mirrors the sidebar navigation of Error Tracking docs. The hierarchy drives how users discover and navigate docs.

```

├── start-here.mdx              # Quest-log entry point

```

The sidebar sections – Getting started, Concepts, Guides, Resources – are defined in `src/navs/index.js`, not by folder structure. Files live flat in the product folder.

## Sidebar sections

Product docs are organized into these high-level sections. Each section contains specific types of pages that serve different purposes in the user journey.

## Getting started

The onboarding section. Contains pages that help new users get up and running with the product.

### 1. Start here page

The entry point for new users. These pages give readers an overview of the tasks necessary to be successful with your product, like the main quest line of a video game.

These pages are our highest converting pages, so they matter. Uses the `QuestLog` component to create a visual roadmap that guides users through adoption milestones.

Structure each quest item with: required → recommended → optional progression, platform selectors for installation, screenshots showing what they'll achieve, and links to deeper docs.

Key frontmatter for start-here pages:

```yaml
---
title: Getting started with [Product Name]
hideRightSidebar: true
contentMaxWidthClass: max-w-5xl # QuestLog component needs extra horizontal space
---
```

> **Example** - [Error Tracking start-here](/docs/error-tracking/start-here)

### 2. Installation guides

Installation docs are shared between the in-app onboarding flow and the posthog.com website. The single source of truth lives in the [posthog/posthog monorepo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/tree/master/docs/onboarding), and the website pulls the content automatically.

See the [onboarding docs runbook](/handbook/docs-and-wizard/onboarding-docs) for full details on how to create or migrate installation guides.

#### Auto-generated platform grids

The installation index page displays a grid of platform cards that's automatically generated from the sidebar navigation. This means you never manually maintain a hardcoded list of platforms.

How it works:

1. The index page imports a snippet that calls `usePlatformList()`
2. The hook reads all MDX files in the installation folder
3. It sorts them based on the order defined in `src/navs/index.js`
4. Each platform's logo comes from the `platformLogo` frontmatter field

> **Example** - [Error Tracking installation index](/docs/error-tracking/installation)

## Concepts

Foundational knowledge. Explains how things work under the hood to build mental models for complex systems.

### Concept pages

Explain how things work under the hood to build mental models for complex systems. Use diagrams and examples.

Include Mermaid diagrams for flows and relationships, definitions with context, examples of real-world scenarios, and links to implementation details.

> **Examples** - [Fingerprints](/docs/error-tracking/fingerprints), [Issues and exceptions](/docs/error-tracking/issues-and-exceptions), [Stack traces](/docs/error-tracking/stack-traces), [Releases](/docs/error-tracking/releases)

## Guides

Task-oriented how-tos. Help users complete specific actions and workflows with the product.

### Guide pages

Task-oriented how-tos that help users complete specific actions. In general, one page per major task or workflow.

On each page, include a brief intro explaining what the guide helps you do, screenshots showing the feature in the UI, step-by-step instructions with links to relevant app pages, and tables for comparing options. Integrate links naturally throughout the content rather than in a separate section.

> **Examples** - [Capture exceptions](/docs/error-tracking/capture), [Manage and resolve issues](/docs/error-tracking/managing-issues), [Send alerts](/docs/error-tracking/alerts), [Set up integrations](/docs/error-tracking/integrations)

## Resources

Reference material and support. Contains utility pages that users reference when needed.

### Troubleshooting page

Common issues and solutions that unblock users who are stuck. Keep this updated based on support tickets and community questions.

Start with the `<AskAIInput>` component, then use searchable headings with numbered solutions. Each section should be scannable and actionable.

> **Example** - [Error Tracking troubleshooting](/docs/error-tracking/troubleshooting)

### Pricing page

Explain the product's pricing model, free tier limits, and how usage is calculated. Link to the main pricing page for full details.

> **Example** - [Error Tracking pricing](/docs/error-tracking/pricing)

### Changelog page

Auto-generated list of product updates using the `<ProductChangelog>` component. Requires `hideRightSidebar: true` in frontmatter.

> **Example** - [Error Tracking changelog](/docs/error-tracking/changelog)

### Tutorials page

Curated list of tutorials and guides for the product. Links to blog posts and community content.

> **Example** - [Error Tracking tutorials](/docs/error-tracking/tutorials)

### References page

Links to SDK reference docs and API documentation filtered by product.

> **Example** - [Error Tracking references](/docs/error-tracking/references)

## How revops works
Revops at PostHog combines data from marketing, sales, product usage, and customer success to show 
what's working and what isn't. While individual teams deeply understand their specific areas, we 
provide insights about how different parts of the business affect each other. Similar to how product 
managers support engineers, we support go to market teams by helping them see these connections and 
make better decisions.

## Revops values
1. Make data simple
2. Build for self service
3. Automate relentlessly

### 1. Make data simple
PostHog has data everywhere: product usage, sales pipelines, support tickets, revenue numbers. 
With this wealth of data comes complexity. We turn this scattered data into clear insights 
teams can use.

This means:
- Creating reliable, unified views that combine data from multiple sources
- Building clear abstractions that hide unnecessary complexity
- Maintaining source of truth definitions for key metrics
- Finding useful patterns in customer behavior
- Showing how each team's work affects our customers

### 2. Build for self service
Teams should get the data they need without waiting for revops. Like engineers ship without 
PM approval, go to market teams should be able to analyze data without asking us.

This means:
- Making all our data and processes visible by default
- Helping teams answer their own questions

### 3. Automate relentlessly
Manual work wastes time and doesn't scale. If someone has to do something twice, we automate it. 
If a team at PostHog struggles with revenue operations, we've probably:
- Not automated enough tasks
- Tried to automate something we shouldn't
- Made data too hard to access
- Miss important customer data

We rely on teams to tell us what's not working because they see the problems first.

## Revops vision

### Things we want to be brilliant at
**Connect the dots:** Help teams understand how their work impacts others, 
things like how marketing activities influence sales metrics, how product usage affects expansion, 
or how support interactions relate to customer health.

**Rapid insights:** Anyone should be able to quickly spot trends, identify problems, and understand what's working. 
This means having clear dashboards, alerts for issues, and easy ways to analyze customer and revenue data.

**Automation mindset:** Manual, repetitive work should be rare so all teams can focus on acting
and improvements rather than routine tasks.

### Things we want to do next
**Revenue attribution:** Understand how customers move from free to paid, including what features 
they use, how long it takes, and what influences faster conversions. When a customer upgrades or 
buys more, know exactly why: was it reading docs? using a specific feature? talking to support?

**Predictive analytics:** Build on our work around identifying expansion signals to get ahead of 
customer behavior, find customers likely to buy more before they ask, and identify unhappy customers 
before they leave.

### Things we don't want to spend time on
**Being the "data police":** We don't want to spend time enforcing data formats or policing how teams 
use tools. We focus on making it easy to do the right thing, not enforcing rules

**Running reports for people:** If someone regularly needs data, we should teach them how to get it themselves.

**Clean up projects:** If we're constantly cleaning up data problems, we've built the wrong systems, and should 
fix the source problems instead.

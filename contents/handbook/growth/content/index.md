Regularly publishing useful content helps to:

* build awareness of PostHog in the developer community
* convert people who are aware of us into users
* convert users into power users

## Content personas

We tailor content to specific audiences.

### Awareness

Many developers have no idea who we are, and do not have a current need for PostHog at this time. However, they may develop a need in future. These people are interested in broader content:

* Syndicating content about how to make your product successful - being a pundit.
  * New and useful open source libraries to build / understand user behavior
  * Syndicating content aboout talking to users and how to do product for engineers
  * Running an engineering team that ships
  * Big new releases in popular libraries that people use to ship with
  * Useful new products that are released
* 1st hand content about building an open source company
  * Building in the open

There are also developers that have no idea who we are, but with a specific need that we could solve:

* Tutorials explaining the use cases of our product

### Known but not using

There are thousands of developers who are aware of us, but who are *not* using us, yet! This could be people who have starred our repo, people who have made a demo / sales or startup scheme enquiry, people that our own team knows like other founders, and potentially even users that have churned.

With this group, we need content that demonstrates the product's use cases, and highlighting what is changing as the product's capabilities expand.

* Monthly wrap ups that contain the headline new features and any new tutorials

### Using

Once people start using PostHog, we've seen we get word of mouth growth when we really impress people, which has so far come from shipping fast. Our content can reinforce this, and to make these users clear how to get the most use out of the product. We also want to encourage people to take place

PostHog helps engineers understand the impact of their work. PostHog also believes in product led growth - we aim to provide a playboook that is relevant and helps engineers implement product led growth principles into their own products.

## What is Product led growth?

Product led growth is the idea that you should use your product not a sales team as the main driver of user acquisition and beyond (in that this model flows through the whole user lifecycle).

Ultimately it is imperative that you have a **great** product - without this you won’t have users with which to drive further acquisition. All of our examples will focus on “great” products.

### Funnels - The old fashioned way

Traditional User Lifecycles have assumed funnel led growth as a way of increasing the users of your product.

This would mean **marketing** to your potential user base so they could become aware and interested in your product, a **sales** team to help that decision process by demonstrating or walking users through the product and then some form of after care once a user became a “customer”\*.

\*(A customer in this case can mean anything from a user who has deployed your product to making an actual purchase of your product)

It would look something like this:

![Sales Funnel](../images/04/Sales-funnel-1.png)

This approach means to grow, you can focus on getting more potential users into the top of the funnel or getting a greater percentage of prospects through the various stages.

If you have no reference point for what that efficiency should be you might not ever optimize hence why qualitative tactics would be used to optimize that funnel - scaling a sales team, collaborating with marketing to work out why people drop out.

This itself led to the idea of commercial analytics software that would help marketing and sales professionals work out how to improve the ratio of people entering and exiting the funnel. 

Ultimately this model can lead to cognitive bias - it leads to a single result at which point the process must begin again. 

### The new way - a circular user lifecycle

Product led growth reimagines the user lifecycle as a circle with users at the center. 

![Sales flywheel](../images/04/Events_Log-1-1.png)

Growth tactics will tend to work regardless of whether you follow the old fashioned way or a circular user lifecycle. However because your actions don’t aim to just move a user in a single direction and take into account continuous operation you can reduce friction in your onboarding process, and increase the speed at which you grow. 


Those funnel stages instead become:

Awareness / Traditional Marketing →  **Understand / Attract / Acquire Users**

Interest / Sales outreach and closing →  **Communicate / Engage / Activate Users**

Decision / Account Management or Customer success →  **Deliver / Delight / Retain Users**

And by repeating this process you will increase user acquisition as retained users will help you attract new ones.

|   	|   Circular lifecycle	|   Sales funnel	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
|   Pros	|   Places customers at the center - forces strategic changes on your product to massively increase growth.	|  Focuses tactical changes to user acquisition process to increase conversion. 	|
|   Cons	|   Strategic focus requires organizational buy-in.	|   Can be transactional, creates a lot of effort for 1 purchase or sale that must be repeated.	|

## Airtable is excellent at Understanding / Attracting / Acquiring Users 

![Airtable logo](../images/04/airtable.png)

The first segment is attracting new users of your product - in doing so you need to understand why they use your product - ideally not “people use my product because x” but identifying the root causes of this.

[Think about the 5 whys used in Toyota's manufacturing process now used within Kaizen,lean manufacturing and Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)

Airtable did not start out believing the world needed improved spreadsheets. Howie Liu (Airtable's CEO) recognised that the vast majority of spreadsheets were being used for data storage.

"*Spreadsheets are really optimized for numerical analysis and financial calculations. But almost 90% of spreadsheets don’t have formulas. Most are used for organizing purposes.*"

Understanding this led Airtable to develop in effect a database with a spreadsheet front-end - a product that did data storage well without it's user having to be an engineer.

As Howie Liu mentioned in a HN [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13669281).

"*We think Airtable is to spreadsheets/Access/Filemaker what Slack is to email*"

With this understanding Airtable could build features that would encourage more user acquistion and the marketing / sales tactics that go with them.

### 1. No code

![Drag n drop](../images/04/airtablednd.gif)

Airtable was founded in 2012 but didn't launch it's first database till winter 2015, that's because it was very important that Airtable could be used without writing a single line of code. 

Understanding that people were using spreadsheets in lieu of databases because the required skills were lower albeit missing their core value:

|   	|   Spreadsheet	|   Database	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|
|   Key value	|   Complex numerical capability	|  Storing different types of data 	|
|   Required knowledge	|  Mathmatical skills to write formulas	|   Server-side scripting or SQL	|

Understanding that users should be able to replicate what an engineer would use a databse for without knowing SQL allowed for the mass adoption or 'virality' that marks many product led growth successes. If someone who had struggled with spreadsheets before and received this experience Airtable created situations in which Airtable users would tell their friends.

We don't have clear data on how many users adopted Airtable from their launch in 2015 but being able to raise $8 million a few months later hints at very strong user acquisition.

### 2. iOS at launch

![iOS Airtable](../images/04/airtable-ios-e1587742106987.png)

Given the user that Airtable wanted to reach out to (and the time they were prepared to put in to get it right) it was just as important to allow users to access Airtable in mobile as well as desktop versions. 

The decision to launch with mobile is understandable given Airtable's knowledge of their users, this [review](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/better-mobile-organization-with-airtable/) from 2016 emphasies the shallow learning curve. This aids virality and user acquisition by also creating a stark contrast with the existing usage of spreadsheet tools - not too many people use Excel on mobile. Even a [post-mortem](https://medium.com/the-fieldbook-blog/what-happened-at-fieldbook-d70bf25b3968) on Fieldbook the closest competitor when they shut down focussed on Airtable's emphasis on mobile experience and collaboration over data modelling 

"*with more emphasis on mobile experience and collaboration features than on data modeling or formulas. These aren’t the features that were most important to the users we talked to, but they’re easier to understand*"

### 3. Product customization > pre-built templates

![Kanban airtable](../images/04/kanban-airtable.gif)

A standard product led growth tactic is to get your own users to encourage their friends or colleagues to begin using your product, think Dropbox's referal program or shared folders.

Airtable went one further, by sharing custom functionality as pre-built templates. 

As their blog mentioned in 2015 3 months after their launch "*We’re seeing people using our tools in ways we never could have imagined—preserving ancient languages, tracking scientific equipment, managing construction projects, and even planning a U.S. presidential campaign*"

The most popular tools built with Airtable became their pre-built templates, tracking what was used most, shared and adopted allowed Airtable to present these to new users, tightenting a feedback loop that also supported their knowledge that ease of use drove adoption best.

Airtable users in effect determined the product roadmap and Airtable knew how to "listen" to them.

### 4. API Builder & Zapier Integration

![API Zapier](../images/04/airtablezapier.png)

If a product led growth mindset focuses on users having the easiest onboarding experience, integrations tend to come at the top of a growth engineers focus. If our product integrates with other apps people will naturally use our app more? 

*But* it is also important as Airtable have shown to focus on the right integrations. More integrations doesn't necessarily equal more usage, and better adoption.

They began with an API builder, users could pull data from their underlying databaes - usage is not bottlenecked if you can easily take data from where you had been storing it. The second was integrating with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/home) which itself automates the process of integrating web applications.

In 2015 this meant Airtable users could connect 450 apps via Zapier with Airtable Integrations. The importance of this integration can be viewed from 3 perspectives:

#### 1. Users had access to a vast number of integrations.
	
Rather than integrate with Slack, Google apps, or GitHub one at a time Airtable saved it's own technical overhead **AND** allowed users could pick and choose what apps they needed for their tools in Airtable, encouraging more customization as above creating the chance of more feedback loops.

#### 2. No code.
	
Airtable is already dedicated to making it easier for users to gain the benefits of relational databases without knowing SQL - this integration aided the No code feature approach. Increasing the chances that users whould be able to share this integration with others.

#### 3. It benefited Zapier as well as Airtable

Airtable wasn't taking functionality to help their own growth - this integration prompted growth on Zapier's side - meaning Airtable took advantage of increased use of Zapier. So much so Zapier's own blog [hyped](https://zapier.com/blog/how-zapier-uses-airtable/) Airtable more than [once](https://zapier.com/blog/airtable-automations/), and even Slack's own [twitter noting](https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/708396388246286336) this integration.

### 5. Airtable Universe 

![airtable universe](../images/04/airtable-universe-e1587986405828.png)

This feature came along a little later than the others in 2017 as Airtable's primary learning resource center, you could think of it as part community showcase, part docs, part training program. It takes product customization to another level.

However it applies learnings from the features above:

* No Code: As a learning center, users didn't have to code anything to learn from it's articles and docs
* Product Customization: Users could now see those customizations created not only from seeing pre-built templates, in addition to this bases here could immediately be cloned to and customized by the new user
* Created a place where users could share their own Airtable content - a branded shared folder of how to get value out of Airtable

Airtable universe in effect generated new ideas on how use Airtable, increasing user acquisition whilst also helping define the Airtable roadmap at the same time as being predominantly user generated.

------


Airtable didn't build these features because all product led growth strategies should, they built the features because they understood those features would lead to increased user adoption.

And it got reveneue to jump 400% in 2018 to $20 million mostly via word of mouth. The way users interacted with those features in turn led Airtable to refine or improve those features. This is the second segment activating those users.

## Zoom is excellent at Communicating / Engaging / Activating Users 

![Zoom logo](../images/04/zoom-logo.png)

Once you understand the value of your own product - how do you communicate this to your own users? 

This should also ensure you’re building the right features, something looks cool but if it doesn't attract or activate your users it won’t increase the number of users gaining direct value from your product.

Zoom’s stock price has recently jumped again but its initial activation strategy was excellent. In this stage it is important to communicate that value to your users - so that they can begin to get the benefits of your product soon. 

In our old model this would be done in sales demonstrations, relying on a sales person to effectively communicate how the product matched the perceived problems the users faced. In product led growth the product is expected to do this itself. 

For the most part this requires some sort of free trial / demo / freemium model so that users can test that value themselves. Zoom’s method was very successful because (as might become apparent with these examples) it attracted and in turn activated users - this was done through letting any users host a 40 minute meeting or less free - analytics suggested 45 minutes was the ideal meeting time.

![zoom example](../images/04/zoomexample.jpg)

The underrated part of this is that the freemium offering is very simple - ensuring customers understand what a paid version would include without limiting their ability to solve the initial problem is key to removing friction. 

Zoom had 3 millions meeting participants in 2013 - this was 30 million in 2014 and 100 million in 2015

## Typeform is excellent at Delivering / Delighting / Retaining Users

![Typeform logo](../images/04/typeform-logo-e1586796641495.png)

To keep the momentum of the wheel model - retaining the energy put into attracting and engaging your users to your product now must deliver on the promises you made when attracting them. 

This can be somewhat aligned with a “build it and they will come” idea but the key is to tie together the understandings you made when building the features to continue to delight your customers.

Typeform’s value proposition is simple - an easy way to build forms online, the idea stemmed from some design project work the founders had done. The idea had inherent virality - sharing forms means that your initial users will expose your product to other users and as such can grow organically. 

BUT this is a really crowded space - Survey Monkey, Google forms, Cognito etc, most people in this situation following a traditional sales funnel would look to shout the loudest / sell the hardest to make space. 

But with a focus on delighting users and making the product speak for itself Typeform retained them because it built the product for continued delivery of the value they initially understood. 

[The CEO himself focused on the "unique experience" of the user](https://saasclub.io/podcast/typeform-a-case-study-in-product-led-saas-growth-with-david-okuniev-230/)

*“We were much more differentiated in the early days because everyone was just doing the plain vanilla forms. 
These companies doing feedback as...data collection will always be very focused only on the analysis of data, the actual collection through the form was just a means to an end. No company ever thought of actually making that into a great experience.”*

![typeform gif](../images/04/typeform-example.gif)

Virality isn’t enough - the continued focus on developing something that will delight your users is key too.
 
Typeform ran in beta for 12 months to get this right - that product led growth approach did mean they jumped to $1m in annual recurring revenue 12 months after introducing a paid plan.

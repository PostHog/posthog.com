##Self-serve

We believe this approach will lead to the best product for end users, which is how we'll build the best company.

[Adam Gross](https://twitter.com/adam_g?lang=en) has given some excellent [talks on this topic](https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/self-serve-go-to-market/), that we've borrowed from.

#1-2-3 framework

## Product

This means the path to revenue starts with adoption of a Free version, then working out how to get teams (whether a small team at a big company or a 20 person startup) onto a paid version, and ultimately how to get departmental adoption at large enterprises.

| | 1 - Free | 2 - Team (Self Serve) | 3 - Enterprise (C-Level) |
|---|---|---|---|
|Value|Creation|Collaboration|Compliance|
|GTM|Free/Adoption|Self-serve|Enterprise|

### Examples of other companies following (part) of this

#### Postman

As an individual, it is useful for organizing your own API creation activity.

In team mode, it is a way for multiple teams to organize distributed development effort. If you're building across multiple teams with different services, how you coordinate these teams is a big, strategic business problem. By using the same tool with modifications, you can orchestrate this.

#### LaunchDarkly

As an individual, you can view as a pure utility for launching feature flags. I can write myself or use this thing off the shelf to save time. Interesting but limited value proposition.

In team mode, it becomes a way for a team to organize its business process between Product Managment and Engineering. It becomes a product management process tool on rails.

## Our structure

As we grow, it'll get important to work out which teams in PostHog own different functions.

# How to do discovery at PostHog 

## The discovery mindset

Discovery isn't just about presenting PostHog's features - it's about actually becoming someone your customer can trust by deeply understanding their business and helping them figure out whether PostHog is a good fit. Your goal is to uncover the real problems, understand their current state, and identify who potentially can champion PostHog internally.

This is meant to be a guide, not a rule-set. Individuals at PostHog are just that, individuals. Each person has their own unique style, delivery, tone, cadence. The goal here is to surface the right insights, by providing a framework for how to go about _asking the right questions_ vs. a talk-track for how to run discussions with customers. 
  
**Core principles:**

- **Curiosity over pitching** - Be genuinely interested in their challenges
- **Find the pain** - People buy solutions to problems, not features
- **Identify champions** - Someone needs to sell internally when you're not there

Discovery isn't one-sided questioning - it's give and take. You learn something, you show something, you ask questions, repeat. The goal is understanding what customers are trying to accomplish so we can focus on relevant features rather than discussing everything PostHog can do.

## Why discovery matters at PostHog
PostHog is a broad product suite with many nuances depending on the use case. Discovery helps us provide customers with a better experience by understanding their specific needs so we can:

- **Conduct a demo that actually matters** - No one wants to sit through features they'll never use
- **Draw connections between their problems and our products** - There are 10+ products (and counting), we want to help them find the right combination
- **Skip the irrelevant stuff and get to the good bits** - Customers' time is valuable, and generic sales calls aren't
- **Reduce time & effort needed for them to make a confident decision** - By understanding requirements upfront, we can address concerns early and focus on what matters most to stakeholders

This isn't about qualifying customers through a rigid framework - it's about delivering value through understanding what they actually care about. 

## Timeline for discovery

Discovery isn't about peppering customers with questions - it's about making sure we actually understand what they're looking to achieve. Depending on the context, there is normally no pressure to get all of your discovery questions answered on the first call. Discovery happens over the course of your engagement with the customer and isn't a 'box' you can check off of your to-do list. Beyond your first interaction with a customer, there will be other opportunities + mediums for which you can do deeper discovery and build a relationship over a longer time-horizon. 

Sometimes this can work to your benefit as, like with most relationships, they are not often built overnight. 

### Other channels

Beyond the 1st call, there are other channels which you can use for discovery:

- Zoom / Phone
- Email
- Shared team Slack channel
- DMs in Slack / LinkedIn / X
- Text / SMS

Leverage these wisely by using your best judgement in combination with asking yourself the question "What would PostHog do?"

## Before your 1st call

### Prep work

There is a bare minimum of preparation recommended prior to speaking with any new customer interested in engaging further with PostHog. Below are some recommendations around where and how you can prepare prior to said meeting: 

- Cross-reference Vitally, PostHog, Slack and Salesforce for any prior engagement or current activity/status. 
- Learn more about who you're speaking with by visiting their LinkedIn page or X profile (our ICP is often more active here). 
- Visit the company's website, learn about their product, who they are marketing/selling to, language they are using. Familiarize yourself with what may be important to them.
- Use ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, etc. to help research the company, their industry, and potential use cases for PostHog. 

## Market & industry intelligence

In addition to doing discovery with the aim of learning more about the customer's business, there are also macroeconomic factors at play that may impact the decision-making process. Before your first call, it may prove valuable to understand the broader business context that may influence their decision-making. These types of questions are not necessarily best answered by the customer you're working with, but rather by researching the vertical/segment they are working in. 

#### A. Industry landscape 

**Market pressures and trends that affect their space**
- What's happening in their industry that's creating pressure right now?
- Any regulatory changes that might be shaking things up?

#### B. Competitive positioning

**Understanding their position in the market**
- How do they stand out from competitors?
- Where's the market heading and how are they preparing for it?

#### C. Economic environment

**Business climate**
- How's the current economic environment affecting their business?
- What's making them feel urgent (or cautious) about new tools like PostHog?
- How has their approach to new investments shifted lately?

## What makes PostHog different

### The demo

Demoing PostHog is an important part of our sales process and how we first introduce PostHog to customers. It brings immediate value to a call, is consistent with other messaging and builds credibility with technical customers. Discovery during an initial call isn't designed to get in the way of demoing PostHog, but rather - be complementary. In other words, the demo itself should create opportunities to ask questions. 

This approach:

- Leverages PostHog's technical credibility through showing vs. telling
- Uses the demo as a conversation starter rather than a monologue
- Maintains a successful pattern while adding strategic depth

##### Examples:

- Demo of Product Analytics: _Showing a funnel analysis_ 
  - Questions: "Is there a conversion flow you're currently struggling to understand?"
- Demo of Session Replay: _Showing user session with errors_
  - Questions: "How do you currently know if users are struggling with your product?"
- Demo of Web Analytics: _Showing UTM sources breakdown_
  - Questions: "How are you currently attributing conversions across channels?"
- Demo of Autocapture: _Showing retroactive insight creation_
  - Questions: "How much dev time do you currently spend on instrumentation?"
- Demo of Error Tracking: _Showing error dashboard_
  - Questions: "How do you currently prioritize bugs to fix first?"

### Strategic feedback during the demo

Demoing also provides an opportunity to get strategic feedback from the customer in real-time on what they are most excited about. 

##### Examples:

- "Who else would find this valuable?"
- "How does this compare to how you're handling this today?"
- "Of what was covered, what did you find most valuable?"

The demo itself can become a great discovery tool. A customer's reactions, questions and engagement levels can provide you with insights on their priorities, pain points and team dynamics much more organically vs. direct questioning alone. 

Almost all objections that come up during a demo can be turned into discovery opportunities with phrases like "tell me more," "how do you handle this today," or "how would you use that." 

## How to ask better questions

Discovery is about understanding the real problem through natural conversation. The goal is to be genuinely curious about their situation, not to interrogate them.

**Question principles:**

- Use "what" and "how" to signal curiosity rather than judgment
- Start questions with "tell me...", "explain to me...", or "describe to me..." to avoid yes/no answers
- Focus on understanding their current state and challenges
- Ask about consequences and impact naturally as the conversation flows

**Questions that feel natural:**

- "Why the urgency to get this done now?"
- "What would happen if you did nothing?" 
- "What might derail this project?"
- "How does this compare to how you're handling it today?"
- "Who else would find this valuable?"
- "What questions should I be asking that I haven't asked yet?"

These questions feel conversational rather than like an interview, and they help uncover the real drivers behind their interest in PostHog.

## Using questions to identify your champion

### Identifying potential champions

Champions aren't just customers you're friendly with - they're people who will actively sell your solution internally. Look for these signals as you ask questions during discovery:

**Questions to identify champions:**

- "Who else is affected by this problem?" (Look for advocacy in their response)
- "How do you typically evaluate new tools at [Company]?" (Champions know the process)
- "What would need to happen for this to get approved?" (Champions understand internal politics)
- "Who would be most excited about solving this?" (Champions will often name themselves)

**Characteristics to listen for:**

- Using "we" and "us" language (ownership)
- Asking for detailed technical / instrumentation questions
- Mentioning budget or approval processes prior to you asking
- Referencing internal stakeholders by name
- Expressing personal frustration with their current state
- Have a vision for what future state needs to look like

**Follow-up questions for potential champions:**

- "What's your role in making this decision?"
- "How have you handled similar evaluations in the past?"
- "What concerns might others have about changing tools?"
- "Besides you, who else would we need to win over?"

### Building champion relationships

**Create mutual investment:**

- "What questions should I be asking that I haven't asked yet?"
- "If you were me, how would you go about positioning PostHog?"
- "What's the best way to position this to [insert stakeholder here]"
- "How can I help you build the internal case for this?"

While you should start identifying potential champions early in your sales process, building these relationships is an ongoing effort that strengthens as the evaluation progresses.

## Discovery call structure with question flow

**Note:** If this is a first call, you'll want to leave enough time for the demo (see the demo section above). This means you really only have roughly 5-7 minutes (if that) for discovery before jumping into showing PostHog - use that time wisely.

### 1. Opening & understanding their situation (5-7 mins)

**Goal:** Get rapport, learn about their setup, and uncover any frustrations

**Natural questions to flow between:**

- "What prompted you to reach out to PostHog?"
- "What are you using for analytics today and how's it working?"
- "What's your experience with tools like this?"
- "Who on your team uses this data and for what?"
- "What decisions are you trying to make that you can't make today?"
- "How does your team typically evaluate new tools?"
- "Is there anyone else who should be part of these conversations?"

**When you get surface-level answers:**

**If they say:** "We're using Google Analytics and it's okay" 
**Follow with:** "What would make it better than okay?"

**If they say:** "We need better user tracking" 
**Follow with:** "What's not working with your current tracking?"

**If they say:** "Our current tool is too expensive" 
**Follow with:** "What's driving the cost - volume, features, or something else?"

### 2. Understanding impact (during or after demo)

**Goal:** Learn how these challenges affect their business

**Natural questions:**

- "How often do these issues come up?"
- "Who else feels this pain?"
- "What's the cost when you can't get the data you need?"
- "Tell me about a recent example where this was a problem"

The key is keeping it conversational - if you're genuinely curious about their situation, this should come naturally. Remember, the demo itself creates lots of opportunities for discovery questions. 

## Summary

Good discovery helps you address gaps in your knowledge about a customer and makes efficient use of both your time and theirs. By understanding their actual needs, challenges, and decision-making process upfront, you can:

- Focus conversations on what matters most to them
- Avoid wasting time on irrelevant features or solutions
- Build trust through genuine understanding
- Identify the right internal champions
- Move deals forward more efficiently

Remember: discovery isn't a checkbox to complete - it's an ongoing process of understanding that makes every subsequent interaction more valuable for everyone involved.

## Closing thoughts

A lot of this is context dependent, right? The goal here isn't to pepper customers with incessant questions or be formulaic in how you run calls; the goal is to be genuinely curious about what their current state looks like in an effort to properly prescribe how PostHog will solve it.

If you get the feeling that the customer isn't open to sharing more, don't push or prod. Use good judgment when approaching discovery and dig deeper if/when appropriate.

At the end of the day, this is a human to human interaction and the hope is that many of these insights are organically surfaced by virtue of asking the _right questions_ vs. having all the right answers while in conversation with a customer. The operative word here being _conversation_ vs. interview/interrogation. 

This isn't a new thread you've started with your LLM of choice, it's a discussion, a conversation with a fellow human. Put yourself in the customers shoes - what type of person would you look to be working throughout the sales process?

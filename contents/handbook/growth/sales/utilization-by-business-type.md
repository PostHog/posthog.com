### Key metrics & PostHog

#### Patient Outcomes
**Importance:** This is the core metric for any healthcare product, measuring the actual health impact on patients. Demonstrating positive patient outcomes is crucial for clinical validation, provider adoption, regulatory approval, and building patient trust. It is the ultimate measure of product value and efficacy.
**PostHog approach:** Track key events in the patient journey, such as `treatment_plan_started`, `outcome_measured`, and `follow_up_completed`. Use properties to segment by treatment type, patient demographics, and specific outcome metrics. Cohort analysis can track how outcomes trend over time for different patient groups. Dashboards can visualize progress towards clinical goals, and correlation analysis can help identify which product features are linked to better outcomes. Non-technical users, like clinicians, can use dashboards to monitor patient progress without writing code.

#### Compliance Metrics
**Importance:** Healthcare is a highly regulated industry (e.g., HIPAA in the US). Compliance metrics track adherence to these regulations, particularly around data privacy and security. Failure to comply can result in severe penalties, loss of trust, and legal action, making it a foundational requirement for any MedTech product.
**PostHog approach:** Track all compliance-related events, such as `hipaa_audit_trail_accessed`, `data_access_logged`, and `patient_consent_obtained`. Properties should include the user role, type of data accessed, and audit results to create an immutable log. Dashboards can provide a real-time view of compliance activities, and alerts can be set up for any unauthorized access attempts or compliance failures. Non-technical compliance officers can use these dashboards to monitor activity and generate reports.

#### User Adoption
**Importance:** Measures how effectively healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, etc.) are integrating a new tool into their daily work. Low adoption by clinicians can undermine the intended benefits of a technology, regardless of its potential. High adoption is key to realizing efficiency gains and improving patient care at scale.
**PostHog approach:** Track user interactions such as `feature_used`, `workflow_completed`, and `training_module_completed`. Segment by user role (e.g., doctor, nurse) using properties. Adoption funnels can show where users drop off during onboarding. Session recordings are invaluable for understanding how clinicians use the product in a real-world context. Alerts can flag low adoption in specific departments. Non-technical training teams can analyze session recordings to improve their training materials.

#### Clinical Workflow Efficiency
**Importance:** Measures the time and effort required for clinicians to complete tasks using the product. In the high-pressure healthcare environment, time is a critical resource. Improving workflow efficiency can reduce clinician burnout, lower operational costs, and allow more time for direct patient care.
**PostHog approach:** Track workflow events from start to finish: `workflow_started`, `step_completed`, `workflow_completed`. Use properties to capture the duration of each step and the user role. Funnel analysis is perfect for identifying bottlenecks where users get stuck or take too long. Dashboards can monitor average completion times for key workflows. Non-technical managers can use these funnels to identify areas for process improvement without needing technical assistance.

#### Data Accuracy
**Importance:** In healthcare, critical decisions are made based on patient data. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to misdiagnosis, incorrect treatment, and serious patient harm. This metric tracks the integrity and reliability of the data within the system, which is fundamental to patient safety.
**PostHog approach:** Track data entry and validation events like `data_entered`, `data_validated`, and `error_detected`. Use properties to specify the data type, validation method, and error type. Create dashboards to monitor data quality trends and error rates. Correlation analysis can help identify if specific user roles or workflow steps are associated with higher error rates. Alerts can notify teams of spikes in data entry errors, allowing for swift investigation.

### Key metrics & PostHog

#### Engagement Rate
**Importance:** Measures how actively users are interacting with content beyond just viewing it (e.g., likes, shares, comments, time spent). It's a key indicator of content quality and audience resonance. High engagement suggests that the content is valuable, which is crucial for building a loyal audience and driving retention.
**PostHog approach:** Track engagement events like `content_viewed`, `time_spent_on_page`, `video_played_to_75%`, and `article_shared`. Use properties to segment by content type and user segment. A custom "engagement score" can be created using formulas in PostHog to weigh different interactions. Cohort analysis can track how engagement evolves for different user groups. Non-technical editors can use dashboards to see which articles are most engaging to inform their content strategy.

#### Content Performance
**Importance:** Provides a holistic view of how individual pieces of content contribute to business goals, from views to conversions. Understanding what content performs well is essential for optimizing content strategy, allocating production resources effectively, and maximizing the ROI of content creation.
**PostHog approach:** Track the content lifecycle with events like `content_published`, `content_viewed`, and `content_shared`, enriched with properties like category, author, and format. Use correlation analysis to identify the attributes of successful content (e.g., "how-to" articles over 1500 words drive the most shares). Dashboards can rank content by performance, and alerts can notify teams when a piece of content starts trending. Non-technical content teams can use these insights to double down on what works.

#### User Retention
**Importance:** Measures the percentage of users who return to the platform over time. For media companies, retention is the lifeblood of the business, as it's far more cost-effective than acquisition. High retention indicates that users find ongoing value in the content, which is key for long-term growth and subscription revenue.
**PostHog approach:** Track retention by monitoring `user_returned` or `session_started` events. Use PostHog's retention cohorts to analyze how retention differs by acquisition source or first content consumed. Correlation analysis can identify behaviors (e.g., subscribing to a newsletter) that are leading indicators of retention. Churn prediction models can help proactively identify at-risk users. Non-technical marketers can use cohorts to understand the long-term value of users from different campaigns.

#### Ad Revenue
**Importance:** For ad-supported media companies, this metric directly measures financial performance. Optimizing ad revenue involves balancing user experience with monetization, making it crucial to track metrics like impressions, click-through rates (CTR), and revenue per user.
**PostHog approach:** Track ad-related events like `ad_impression`, `ad_click`, and `ad_revenue_generated`. Use properties to segment by ad type, placement, and user segment. A/B test different ad placements and formats to see what generates the most revenue without harming engagement. Dashboards can monitor ad performance in real-time, and alerts can flag underperforming ad units. Non-technical revenue teams can use these dashboards to track progress against revenue goals.

#### Subscription Metrics
**Importance:** For subscription-based media companies, metrics like conversion rate, subscriber LTV, and churn are the ultimate measure of business health. They track the ability to convert casual readers into paying subscribers and retain them, directly reflecting the perceived value of the premium offering.
**PostHog approach:** Track the entire subscription funnel with events like `paywall_hit`, `subscription_started`, `subscription_renewed`, and `subscription_cancelled`. Use funnel analysis to identify drop-off points in the conversion process and properties like plan type to segment subscribers. Cohort analysis is essential for tracking subscriber LTV and churn over time. Non-technical product managers can use funnels to optimize the checkout flow and A/B test different paywall strategies.

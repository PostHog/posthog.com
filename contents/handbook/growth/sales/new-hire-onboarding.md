## Your first few weeks

Welcome to the PostHog Sales and Customer Success team!  We only hire about 1 in 400 applicants, so you've done well to make it here!  Unlike a lot of companies, we don't have a super-long onboarding process and would prefer you to be up and running with your customer base as quickly as possible.  Here are the things you should focus on in your first few weeks at PostHog to help you achieve that.

Ramping up as an AE is self serve - we won't sit you down in a room for training for 2 weeks. If you're not sure who is supposed to make something below happen, the person responsible is almost certainly you!

## How to fail

But first...

Sales at PostHog isn't like most other software companies! These are some of the things that you _shouldn't_ do:

- Wait til you're ready to talk to customers. Jump in sooner than you feel comfortable - it is by far the fastest way to learn. A great, low-risk way to practise is chat to inbound leads who you think aren't going to be high paying customers - the cost of doing badly is very low!
- Lazily forward customer questions to engineering teams without any context. That's super annoying. Instead:
  - Try to solve the problem yourself, read the Docs etc.
  - Try asking #max-ai in Slack
  - Ask the rest of the Sales and CS team
  - _Then_ forward to the relevant engineering team _and add context_ - are they a huge oppo, evaluating or already paying, technical/non-technical etc.? Help them help you
    - Bonus points for: 'I think [this] is the answer, am I on the right track?'
- Execute your previous company's playbook. We're trying to do things differently from 90% of the industry. But please do tell us what has _and_ hasn't worked at previous places. 
- Keep information to yourself - share openly and frequently the things you are learning, what you've got right or wrong. We don't do lone wolfing here. PostHog is a huge product, so it's ok to ask dumb questions - so long as you've tried to figure it out yourself first! 
- Use sales BS language - if you don't know the answer that's fine! Don't promise features. Don't use vague, non-specific language. Talk to our customers like real human beings, not 'prospects'. And don't be discouraged if they say 'can we talk to someone more technical'!

## Technical Account Executive ramp

### Day 1

- Meet with [Simon](/community/profiles/28895) who will run through this plan and answer any questions you may have.  In addition, come equipped to talk about any nuances around how you prefer to work (e.g. schedules, family time etc.).
- [Mine](/community/profiles/29862) can help you out:
  - [Salesforce](https://posthog.lightning.force.com/)
  - [Vitally](https://posthog.vitally-eu.io/) - use Google SSO
  - [Zendesk](https://posthoghelp.zendesk.com/agent/dashboard) - use Google SSO
  - PostHog [US](https://us.posthog.com/) and [EU](https://eu.posthog.com/) instances (and our production project on the US)
  - [Jimminy](https://app.jiminny.eu/dashboard)
  - [PandaDoc](https://app.pandadoc.com/)
  - Metabase [US](https://metabase.prod-us.posthog.dev/) and [EU](https://metabase.prod-eu.posthog.dev/) - use Google SSO
- If you start on a Monday, join your first PostHog All Hands (at 4.30pm UK/8.30am PT) and be prepared to have a strong opinion on whether pineapple belongs on pizza.
- If you start on a Monday, join your first Sales and CS standup.
  - We fill in a GitHub issue every week before this meeting so we are prepared for the discussion topics.  Simon will add your GitHub handle to the template.

### Rest of week 1

 - Ask team members in your region to be invited to some customer calls so you can gain an understanding of how we work with customers.
 - Check out some [Jimminy](https://app.jiminny.eu/dashboard) calls and add yourself to a bunch of Slack channels - get immersed in what our customers are saying. 
 - Learn and practise a [demo](https://youtu.be/2jQco8hEvTI) of PostHog.
 - Read all of the Sales and CS section in the Handbook, and update it as you learn more.
 - Meet with [Charles](/community/profiles/28625), the exec responsible for Sales and CS. 

### Week 2

- During your first week, Simon will figure out your initial book of business (around 12 accounts).  We will review these at the start of your second week, and make sure you understand how your targets are set. 
- Shadow more live calls and listen to more [Jiminny](https://app.jiminny.eu/dashboard) recordings. There is [a Jiminny playlist with sub-folders containing Sales calls and PostHog knowledge calls](https://app.jiminny.eu/playlists#playlist-355cdc2a-1326-4ea6-97e3-e7749800fc8a), add to it as you listen! 
- Towards the end of the week, schedule a demo and feedback session with Simon.  We might need to do a couple of iterations over the next few weeks as you take on board feedback, don't worry if that's the case!
- Prioritize your current book of customers, and start reaching out!
- Get comfortable with the PostHog [Docs](/docs) around our main products. 
- Consider attending the Onboarding Intros meetings [via this Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_25ceb28129b44d3e9c558c361cc565fde75c95ccf8298857c4c59f9c1f1539f8%40group.calendar.google.com) on Monday and Wednesday, to meet the product teams and learn about the current state of each product/feature. 
- We'll start routing new Salesforce Leads to you at the end of week 1.  Start to review these and reach out, using a shared booking link with someone else from your region so they can back you up in the first few weeks. This is a great option to practise and fail. 

### In-person onboarding

Ideally, this will happen in Week 3 or 4, and will be with a few existing team members (depending on where we do it) and will be 3-4 days covering:

- Demo practice session with the team.
- The data we track on customers in PostHog and some hands-on exercises to get you comfortable using PostHog itself.
- Deep dive on Vitally tracking.
- No stupid questions session.

### Weeks 3-4

- Focus on taking more and more ownership on calls so that team members are just there as a safety net.  
- Continue to meet with your book of customers and inbound leads.

### How do I know if I'm on track?

By the end of month 1:
 - Be leading customer calls and demos on your own
 - Have evaluations in flight (with support from the team if needed)
 - Successfully made contact with _everyone_ in your book of business

By the end of month 2:
 - Have closed your first annual deal of any size (net new or conversion to annual)

- On track to hit 100% quota by the end of month 6

 - Be leading customer calls and demos on your own
 - Converting high value opportunities to Leads in Salesforce

By the end of month 2:

## Tools that you may find useful

- [Cal.com](https://app.cal.com/) for shared meeting booking links

- [LinkedIn Sales Navigator](https://www.linkedin.com/sales/home) for account intelligence
- [Clay](https://www.clay.com/) for account and contact enrichment
- [Scratchpad](https://www.scratchpad.com/) for AI agents and a friendlier SFDC UI (sign up as part of your software budget)

## New hire frequently asked questions

### How does support work at PostHog?

- Generally, you're expected to be able to be the first line of support for customers at PostHog. You should be able to answer _most_ yourself - that's why we hire _Technical_ AEs and CSMs after all! #max-ai in Slack can often help too. 
- If you can't solve a customer's problem (it happens) then follow our [standard support process](/handbook/support/customer-support).

### Can I login as a customer?

- Visit the /admin/ endpoint on the cloud they are on.  You can then search for them via email and log in.  Be careful clicking around here as you can accidentally delete a person/organization! You need to get their permission first unless it's an emergency, i.e. to resolve an incident. 

### Are there any influential folks in our space I should read/listen to?

- Join the `#newsletters` channel in Slack for updates from a curated collection of influential folks in our industry.

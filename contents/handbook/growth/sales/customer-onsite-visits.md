Most of our sales process happens remotely through Slack channels, Zoom / Google Meet calls, and async communication. This works brilliantly for our product-led motion and keeps us efficient. But sometimes it is worth visiting our customers where they are. 

This page covers when face-to-face visits make sense and how to make them count. These are guidelines and you should tweak them to your particular customer.

## When should you visit your customer

- **They ask you to come onsite**; when they ask you to come onsite, that's usually a good signal
- **Large deals** and / or customer with big expansion opportunities ($100K+)
- **Multi-product expansion** where you're getting multiple teams onboard
- **Technical complexity** that's easier to solve in person
- **Multi-team stakeholders** where building deeper relationships create more value

If you find yourself asking why you should visit a particular customer and cannot come up with a good reason, it's probably not necessary visiting them.

**Tip:** If you're travelling to see a customer, check if there are other accounts nearby worth visiting on the same trip.

## Planning the visit

The difference between a productive visit and an unproductive one is in the preparation.

### Understand the scope

Before booking flights, get clear on what type of visit this is:

- **Strategic/expansion discussion** for understanding their roadmap, pain points, and how PostHog can help across multiple teams or products
- **Technical enablement** for hands-on training, architecture reviews, or implementation workshops
- **Hybrid** combining both (common for larger accounts)

Ask the customer directly: "What would make this visit valuable for you?" Their answer will shape your approach.

### Logistics and attendees

**From their side:**
- Who needs to be there? (Get names, roles, and what they care about)
- How much time do they have? (Full day? Few hours? Multiple days?)
- Are key stakeholders available all day or dropping in for specific sessions?
- Do they have a room booked, or do we need to sort that?

**From our side:**
- Do you need engineering support for technical deep-dives?
- Would having someone from CS/support help for training sessions?
- If it's a large account, should leadership (James H, Charles, etc.) join for part of it?

Get everyone briefed beforehand. Share context on the customer, their use case, what success looks like. 

### Do your homework

Before you arrive, you should know:
- **Current PostHog usage** including which products, volume, spend, growth trajectory
- **Gaps and opportunities** for where they aren't using PostHog but could be
- **Technical setup** with implementation details, any known issues or limitations
- **Business context** like company stage, team structure, who owns the budget
- **Previous conversations** covering what we've discussed and what commitments were made

The goal isn't to sell them more stuff. It's to understand how we can genuinely help them get more value from PostHog.

### Agenda

Share a proposed agenda at least a few days before. Make it collaborative: "here's what I'm thinking, but happy to adjust based on what's most useful for you."

Example structure for a full-day visit:
- Morning: Current state review, challenges, roadmap discussion
- Lunch: Relationship building 
- Afternoon: Technical deep-dive, training, or implementation planning
- End: Clear next steps and commitments

If it's a training-focused visit, scope it properly:
- Which products are we covering?
- What's the skill level of attendees?
- Do they want hands-on workshops or demos?
- What should they be able to do independently after this session?

## During the visit

Your job is to listen to the customer, not to present. If you find that you are doing most of the talking, it's probably a good idea to take a different approach.

### Let them talk

You're there to understand:

- What's working well with PostHog?
- What's frustrating or blocking them?
- Where are they heading as a business?
- What problems are they trying to solve that we might help with?

This isn't a formal QBR with slides and decks. Keep it conversational. We're engineers helping engineers, not account managers running through a playbook.

### Closing off and follow-up

Before you leave, make sure everyone agrees on:
- What happens next
- Who owns what
- When you'll speak again

Our customers appreciate a follow-up on Slack or an e-mail the same day / next morning while it's fresh. You can keep it short: recap the key points, confirm next steps, and thank them for their time. If you promised to find something out, make it your priority.

Share what you learned with the rest of the PostHog team. What went well? What didn't? What feedback did you get? This helps everyone improve and means other people can benefit from what you picked up on the visit.

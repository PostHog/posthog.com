We firmly adhere to laws in countries where we do business, and welcome everyone abiding by those legal restrictions to be our customers - paid or free, in all but a few very exceptional circumstances:

* The customer is engaging in illegal or unlawful behavior.
* The customer is encouraging violence or discriminating against legally protected groups.

In these cases, we may choose not to do business with the customer.

#### Sanctioned countries and companies

US laws mean we may also be prohibited from working with certain companies, due to ongoing US sanctions. In this case we do not have discretion - we are banned from working with these companies entirely. 

If you need to check if a particular company appears on a US sanctions list, you can use the [US Treasury's Sanction Search](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/). In particular, you should be mindful of companies that sign up which are based in the following territories:

- Balkans
- Belarus
- Burundi
- Central African Republic
- Crimea
- Democratic Republic of the Congo
- Iraq
- Libya
- Lebanon
- Myanmar (formerly Burma)
- Russia
- Sudan
- South Sudan
- Somalia
- Ukraine
- Venezuela
- Yemen
- Zimbabwe

US sanctions mean that we are not allowed to offer services [at all](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/sanctioned-destinations#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Industry%20and,United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolutions.) to _any_ companies based in:

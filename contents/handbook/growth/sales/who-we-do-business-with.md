We firmly adhere to laws in countries where we do business, and welcome everyone abiding by those legal restrictions to be our customers - paid or free, in all but a few very exceptional circumstances:

* The customer is engaging in illegal or unlawful behavior.
* The customer is encouraging violence or discriminating against legally protected groups.

In these cases, we may choose not to do business with the customer.

Here's how to respond to common customer requests. These usually arrive in the form of new contact form submissions but may also be asked by existing customers too.

## Can you increase my rate limits?

We are working on a charging model for this, but in the interim you can opt customers into the beta by sharing their region (EU or US), organization and project IDs into the [#project-query-api-scheduler](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C0895LZRFQS) channel.  You should also make them aware that whilst this is free whilst in beta, it will become billable when we roll out pricing (current ETA is mid 2025).

## Do you have plans to add more hosting options outside of the US and EU?

Right now, no. The vast majority of our customers are happy to host on one or the other, with EU being the preferred domain for GDPR compliance. This is not a "never", just not in the near future.

## Do you have a dummy account we can mess around with?

No, the best way to trial PostHog is to start sending your own data into it. When a trial is filled with dummy data, which isn't relevant to the specific team, the overall engagement and success of the trial is lower.

## Does PostHog follow the MEDDPICC sales methodology?

Yes! But like everything we do here, it's not what you would expect. At PostHog, MEDDPICC means "Make every deal a delightful PostHog implementation - Charles Cook"

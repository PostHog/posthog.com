Here's how to respond to common customer requests. These usually arrive in the form of new contact form submissions but may also be asked by existing customers too.

## Can you increase my rate limits?

We are working on a charging model for this, but in the interim you can opt customers into the beta by sharing their region (EU or US), organization and project IDs into the [#project-query-api-scheduler](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C0895LZRFQS) channel.  You should also make them aware that whilst this is free whilst in beta, it will become billable when we roll out pricing (current ETA is mid 2025).

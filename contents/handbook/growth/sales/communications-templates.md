We've put together suggested communications templates that TAMs can draw on for various situations like startup plan roll off, incidents, churn risk increase, or new feature rollouts.

These templates are not meant to be restrictive, but a general idea of how we communicate with customers.

## Available templates

- **[Communication templates for incidents](/handbook/growth/sales/communications-templates-incidents)** - How to communicate with customers during service disruptions, from minor issues to critical outages
- **[Communication templates for funding and exits](/handbook/growth/sales/communications-templates-fundraising)** - How to celebrate customer milestones like funding rounds, acquisitions, or IPOs in a genuine, human way
- **[Communication templates for new feature adoption](/handbook/growth/sales/communications-templates-feature-adoption)** - How TAMs can drive adoption of new features with targeted, consultative outreach to specific customers

# AKA our Value Proposition

## A single place to view all of your user data

With disparate tools, it's hard to get an understanding of your users both individually and at an aggregate level.  By integrating a range of products into one platform we provide a greater picture of our customer's users.  Common cross-product use cases are:

 - When looking at a conversion funnel, click a dropped off segment of users to view their session replays.  This helps you understand potential friction/interface issues. 
 - After launching an experiment, click to see the session replays of users experiencing a specific variant, showing you whether your users are experiencing it as intended.
 - Create a survey tied to an experiment (via the feature flag), letting you gather qualitative feedback from users who are experiencing this new feature for the first time.
 - Attach revenue data stored in our data warehouse from Stripe to product analytics to see behaviors which drive revenue acquisition and growth.

## Consolidated pricing

As we have a low price point and can help replace a number of disparate tools they may be running customers are highly likely to save versus the cost of running multiple tools in parallel:

 - We are competitive for each of our individual products
 - You only need to pay for 1 Teams or Enterprise plan versus 5 or 6

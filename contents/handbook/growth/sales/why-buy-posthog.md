AKA our Value Proposition, these are some of the things we've found useful to share when chatting to customers about why PostHog is different and better than our competitors. 

## A single place to view all of your user data

With disparate tools, it's hard to get an understanding of your users both individually and at an aggregate level.  By integrating a range of products into one platform we provide a greater picture of our customer's users.  Common cross-product use cases are:

 - When looking at a conversion funnel, click a dropped off segment of users to view their session replays.  This helps you understand potential friction/interface issues. 
 - After launching an experiment, click to see the session replays of users experiencing a specific variant, showing you whether your users are experiencing it as intended.
 - Create a survey tied to an experiment (via the feature flag), letting you gather qualitative feedback from users who are experiencing this new feature for the first time.
 - Attach revenue data stored in our data warehouse from Stripe to product analytics to see behaviors which drive revenue acquisition and growth.
 - Use Heatmaps to identify potential dead zones on your website, roll out a [no-code experiment](/docs/experiments/no-code-web-experiments) with your conversion funnel as a goal.

## Consolidated pricing

As we have a low price point and can help replace a number of disparate tools they may be running customers are highly likely to save versus the cost of running multiple tools in parallel:

 - We are competitive for each of our individual products
 - You only need to pay for 1 Teams or Enterprise plan versus 5 or 6
 - We make it easy to buy from us, and once you're done you don't need to run multiple vendor procurement processes for additional tools

## A great buying _and_ product experience for large enterprises

It’s easy to fall-back on the magic we create when using multiple products, but positioning for startups and enterprises can be _very_ different. For some enterprises, anything other than the single product they have come in for would be project-killing, scope creep. Our typical, multi-product talk track doesn’t always work here, so it's worth focusing on the more [philosophical points](/why) such as:

- Everybody codes
- Transparent pricing
- Engineers talk to customers
- We ship any missing features fast

That being said, there are still individual product and feature nuggets that enterprises in particular like:

- HoqQL
- Group analytics
- Debug mode
- Annotations
- Event & property correlation analysis
- Edit SQL directly
- Subscriptions
- Notebooks
- Direct access to underlying data (SQL & API)

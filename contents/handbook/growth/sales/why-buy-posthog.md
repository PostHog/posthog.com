AKA our Value Proposition, these are some of the things we've found useful to share when chatting to customers about why PostHog is different and better than our competitors.

# In short

Our messaging varies depending on whether our users have a data engineering team and warehouse already.  If they don't

> PostHog is an all-in-one data warehouse providing the only tools you need to understand and work better with your customers.

If they already have a data engineering team and warehouse already:

> PostHog provides the tools you need to understand and work better with your customers, and integrates seamlessly with your data stack.

## Everybody needs a data warehouse, not everybody needs a data team

For teams of all sizes, it's important to have your product, revenue and operational data available in a single place.

- We allow you to connect a plethora of data sources for revenue, customer and other operational data.
- It's easy to join data from multiple source to add context.
- Visualizing the data is self-serve and doesn't require a data team.
- This level of data accessibility means that your warehouse won't become a dumping ground.

## An integrated place to view all of your user data

With disparate tools, it's hard to get an understanding of your users both individually and at an aggregate level.  By integrating a range of products into one platform we provide a greater picture of our customer's users.  Common cross-product use cases are:

 - When looking at a conversion funnel, click a dropped off segment of users to view their session replays.  This helps you understand potential friction/interface issues. 
 - After launching an experiment, click to see the session replays of users experiencing a specific variant, showing you whether your users are experiencing it as intended.
 - Create a survey tied to an experiment (via the feature flag), letting you gather qualitative feedback from users who are experiencing this new feature for the first time.
 - Attach revenue data stored in our data warehouse from Stripe to product analytics to see behaviors which drive revenue acquisition and growth.
 - Use Heatmaps to identify potential dead zones on your website, roll out a [no-code experiment](/docs/experiments/no-code-web-experiments) with your conversion funnel as a goal.

## Consolidated pricing

As we have a low price point and can help replace a number of disparate tools they may be running customers are highly likely to save versus the cost of running multiple tools in parallel:

 - We are competitive for each of our individual products
 - You only need to pay for 1 Teams or Enterprise plan versus 5 or 6
 - We make it easy to buy from us, and once you're done you don't need to run multiple vendor procurement processes for additional tools

## A great buying _and_ product experience for large enterprises

It’s easy to fall-back on the magic we create when using multiple products, but positioning for startups and enterprises can be _very_ different. For some enterprises, anything other than the single product they have come in for would be project-killing, scope creep. Our typical, multi-product talk track doesn’t always work here, so it's worth focusing on the more [philosophical points](/why) such as:

- Everybody codes
- Transparent pricing
- Engineers talk to customers
- We ship any missing features fast

That being said, there are still individual product and feature nuggets that enterprises in particular like:

- HoqQL
- Group analytics
- Debug mode
- Annotations
- Event & property correlation analysis
- Edit SQL directly
- Subscriptions
- Notebooks
- Direct access to underlying data (SQL & API)

# Vibes and personas

You should apply different messaging to companies at different stages, and the role you're speaking with.  The broad messages we can take to customers are:

1. **You need a data warehouse** and PostHog can be it, helping you follow best practice from the start.
2. **You need a better data warehouse** because yours has no ownership, and is likely not well-structured.
3. **You can self-serve data** as opposed to rely on a data engineering team.
4. **You can capture everything you need to understand about your users** and send it to your existing warehouse.

## Applied by company type

### Startups

Normally they don't have anything in place, and the pitch is (1) - You need a data warehouse.  In the unlikely event that they have a data team already, it's (4) - we integrate with their warehouse.  YC and other startups will be concerned with what metrics they need to capture and demonstrate for their first/next funding round.  PostHog helps you capture and show those all in one place.

### Scaleups

- If they have a warehouse and data team in place already it's difficult to displace, so we should offer the coexistence story (4).
- If they have deployed a warehouse but don't have a data team, we should pitch (2) - implement a better data warehouse.
- Otherwise, we should focus on the role of the person we are speaking with:
  - For **Engineers** and **Leadership** e.g. CTO, its (1) You need a data warehouse, and (3) can self serve rather than building a data team.
  - For **Product** and **Growth**, it's (3) - You can self serve a lot more with us.

### Larger companies

- They will typically be interested in one or two products and have a data team in place already so stick with (4) - we coexist with your existing tools.

Some potential customers either expect to pay for professional services to help them get set up. There are others who don't ask for this, but where we can tell it would be helpful for them. 

> For now this is only a service we offer to potential customers by default, so this will mainly be of interest to the [New Business](/teams/sales-cs) team.

## Who we can offer professional services to

A good candidate for this probably has some combination of the following:

- ARR in the $100k+ region, either today or in the next 12 months (actual spend, not credit)
- Large-ish company with complex needs
- Have explicitly asked about paid implementation services and training
- The team adopting PostHog work in person at a single location
- They are not set up with PostHog yet, ie. we would be helping them implement PostHog in their codebase
- They are able and willing to give our team access to their codebase
- We are helping them get set up with session replay, feature flags, LLM analytics, and/or error tracking

If you are working with someone where this might be applicable, ping Charles and Simon first, as we can offer to send a forward deployed engineer to work with them to help get set up. **Please don't just offer this to anyone without checking in**, as we don't have unlimited capacity. 

For ongoing training, this is something that we are solving for separately, but is not within the scope of professional services at the moment. 

## What work is included

Typically we will send a forward deployed engineer to work with a customer for a week in person. What we charge depends heavily on the nature and scope of the implementation, but in any case starting at $10k. Simon will work with you to figure out the relevant scope of work and contractual terms.

We don't offer this for free, because it is a valuable service that customers expect to pay for. We also don't offer it as a freebie negotiation tactic, because that devalues it for all other customers. 

The specific checklist of what will be implemented depends on the customer, but [this page](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/health-checks) is a good starting point and the [onboarding section](/handbook/onboarding/onboarding-program) of the Handbook is a good starting point, as well as obviously the relevant [docs](/docs).

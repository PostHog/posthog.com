## Purpose

When a customer is coming to the end of their startup credits, this is a prime time to get connected and see if they are interested in pre-purchasing credits. The below examples are good starting points to initiate contact and demonstrate both helpfulness and an opening for commercial discussions. You should personalise these messages to the customer, their needs, and your own personal style.

## Startup plan roll off

### Intro Email
**When:** 1 month before roll off

**Who:** Active users in the company + Stripe email

**Subject:** Hi From PostHog | Startup Plan Roll Off {Date}

You will be rolling off our startup plan on Date. If your current usage continues, you can expect your first invoice to be in the $XXXX a month range.


|Example recommendation| PostHog looks well instrumented with custom events. I did notice you may be [calling identify / set more than once per session](/docs/product-analytics/cutting-costs#only-call-identify-once-per-session), which can lead to an increase in cost. Reducing that would cut your bill down a bit. 


We are also offering two months free to startup plan roll offs that pre-purchase credits. You could save almost $XXK ($XXk from annual discount and $XXK from the two free months) with an |upfront credit purchase|. 


I'll send over a couple more reminders as we get closer to your roll off date.


Cheers,

### Invoice Email
**When:** 2 weeks before first invoice

**Who:** Active users in the company + Stripe email

**Subject:** Hi From PostHog | Upcoming Bill


I wanted to offer you a courtesy notification that you are currently on track for your first ~$XXXX invoice (link to billing page). It looks like your usage has been increasing, due to increased traffic to your site and mobile app.


We offer a slack channel for better comms / support that I'll add you to shortly. Feel free to add anyone else on your team who would benefit.


Finally, I wanted to let you know we offer discounts on pre-purchased credits. You are right in the sweet spot to get XX% and save almost $XXk (link to quote). 


Let me know if you have any questions, happy to help out with anything implementation related.


Cheers,



## Burned Through all Credits

### Intro Email
**When:** Month before first invoice

**Who:** Active users in the company + Stripe email

**Subject:** XXXX$ Posthog Bill | Startup Credits Now Exhausted

Hey Team,


I wanted to let you know that you are on track to burn through your startup credits next month. Your current usage is totalling about $XXk / mo, and you have ~$XXk credits left, so you can expect your first invoice on |DATE| for $XXk.


|Example recommendation| One thing I noticed about your implementation is that you are [calling identify / set more than once per session](/docs/product-analytics/cutting-costs#only-call-identify-once-per-session). We recommend only calling it once.


Finally, as a part of rolling off our startup plan, we are offering 2 months free if you decide to |pre-purchase a bucket of credits|. This would end up saving you almost $XXK over the next year ($XXk on a XX% discount + $XXk on the free months).


Let me know if you have any questions.

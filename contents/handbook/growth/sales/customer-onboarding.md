So, you just sold a deal. How do you onboard the customer so they can make their product(s) more successful?

- If they paid via license.posthog.com, billing will be set up automatically. If not, manually add the client to our billing system (check with Kunal how to do this)
- Ask if you can be added to their team in the app to do account reviews
  - If so, set up recurring task to do this (base on the size of the account)
- Create a private channel for them in Slack (so it's easy to get hold of each other).
  - If they work at a small company, add them to our internal Slack. The advantage of this is that they're going to be logged into it all day, so are likely to be more responsive.
  - If they work at a huge company, they are unlikely to get a channel approved - so use PostHog Community Slack. Check with them if this is likely to be the case.
  - If they don't want to use Slack at all, then you should get them to email hey@posthog.com with any issues.
- Book a setup call and ask the client to invite product/engineering stakeholders
  - Cover how to do product led growth (AARRRR) so they get their events in properly
  - Make sure everyone has seen a demo of the main functionality
  - Get a sense of how quick/slow the implementation will be - so you know what to expect
  - Check how the deployment is going and if any help needed
- Expand the account
  - If they're a large client, they may have multiple product teams. Book Quarterly Business Reviews with the customer - this is a run through of their setup, and our roadmap. You should encourage stakeholders from other products or wider parts of their business to attend too - they may be interested in rolling PostHog out.
  - Work with the client to make sure they:
    - (i) track product performance (they've got events coming in, they are measuring AARRR and they've got a dashboard that breaks down each high level metric)
    - (ii) diagnose performance
    - (iii) release changes with our platform. Often customers may be using just one of the three areas at first.
    - file issues for feature requests if we're missing something / talk to our product team about these

There are regular checks you should do in bulk across all paying accounts:

- Weekly check of usage/invoice amounts
  - do any paying customers have unexpectedly large or small usage?
  - any issues collecting payments?
  - any cancellations? (gulp)
- Every two weeks do a check of latest features - share cool stuff 1/1 with every customer in Slack.
- Every month, get our product team to discuss potentially relevant roadmap features with them, or consider if our product marketing team should run a case study with our clients (free or paid). This helps deepen the relationships we have with them.

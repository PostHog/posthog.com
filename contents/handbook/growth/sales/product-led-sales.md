A large proportion of our paying customer base self-serve and sign up to a paid plan without ever talking to Sales.  For this type of customer we don't want to force them through a sales funnel if they don't need it, however we also realise that having a human to help them through the process on hand is likely to maximize the chances of retaining them as a paying customer long term.

## Product-led lead generation

Product-led leads can be generated in different ways:

1. Customers who have an active subscription in Stripe, and are forecasted to pay a first time bill of $500 or more.
2. Customers who have a high [lead score](/handbook/growth/sales/lead-scoring) (>=20), and have more than 1 user in the organization but haven't yet subscribed.

They follow the [normal territory assignment rules](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales/crm#how-we-do-lead-assignments) in Salesforce. 

## Working with the customer

Just as with the inbound sales process it's on you to decide how you handle the lead.  If you think they have potential to end up paying more than $20K a year then you should reach out to introduce yourself and offer help.  As they have likely done a lot of research themselves they may not need a demo so a 30-minute discovery is the norm here.

If it's a viable opportunity then you should convert the lead to an [opportunity](/handbook/growth/sales/crm#opportunities) and then follow the [New sales process](/handbook/growth/sales/new-sales), bearing in mind that you can join it at any point depending on where the customer is at in their buying journey (e.g. you might skip product evaluation if they are ready to buy).

Even if after speaking with them, you think they may end up at $20K you should educate them on how to get help, as well as the value of adding our Teams and Enterprise plans.

## Getting recognized on the deal

As they have already shown intent by signing up/subscribing then you need to demonstrate that you have actively worked on the opportunity to include it in your book of business.  We will use a common sense approach here but sending a couple of emails and 1 call won't be classed as 'actively working'

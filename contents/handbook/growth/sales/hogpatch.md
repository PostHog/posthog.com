# Hogpatch: Our SF Home for YC Founders

Hogpatch is our dedicated coworking space in San Francisco for YC founders in the current batch - a lofty, airy, light-filled warehouse just around the corner from YC. It's invite-only and open 24/7, giving you a reliable place to work whenever you need it. We've set it up because we know how valuable a quiet space is when you're bouncing between office hours, customer calls, and late-night sprints.

Hogpatch is a free space to help your batch experience a little easier. There's no catch! We're not here to sell you PostHog. We hope that this becomes a dependable home base in the Dogpatch neighborhood for when you need one.

## What's Inside

* **24/7 coworking space:** bring your cofounder and get heads-down in deep product work or last-minute demo day prep.
* **10 Gbps fiber internet:** the fastest wifi in the neighborhood to help you build at lightning speed.
* **Private desks and high-res monitors:** space to work comfortably and focus without distraction.
* **Comfortable phone booths:** quiet spots for user feedback or investor meetings (and perfect for quick calls).
* **Limited edition merch:** free, exclusive PostHog gear you won't find anywhere else.
* **Events space:** occasionally used for founder-focused gatherings, but most of the time open as extra room to spread out.
* **Snacks, coffee, and extra comforts:** endless caffeine on tap.

## Getting Started

### Access

Hogpatch is invite-only, and isn't open to the whole batch. We keep numbers low so it stays calm, focused, and actually useful. When space opens up, we handpick a few YC companies to join. If we want to tap you on the shoulder with an invite, you'll hear from us directly.

* We do maintain a waitlist, but you can't apply - we handpick founders when there's room to welcome more.
* Each invite lasts 3 months. If you join at the start of your batch, that'll usually cover you through demo day. If you join later, you're still welcome to keep using Hogpatch after your batch ends.

### Passes

Once you've been invited, Judy (our [office manager](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/36433)) will send you and your cofounders a digital wallet pass. The pass gives you 24/7 self-service access to the space, ideal for late-night sprints or weekend hacking sessions. You can come in anytime, day or night. There's no check-in or reservations needed.

### Location

Hogpatch is just 100 yards from YC's office, with the nearest Muni stop at 20th Street. You'll find us behind a discreet door off 3rd Street - the exact location is listed on your digital wallet pass. Scan your pass on the front door QR reader to get in, or buzz the intercom for help.

### Support

You'll bump into our product engineers from time to time. They're in the space because they enjoy chatting with founders, and they're happy to give product feedback or help set up your dashboards ahead of demo day.

Judy, our office manager, keeps things running smoothly 9am–5pm, Mon–Fri. Outside those hours, treat the space like it's your own. If anything urgent comes up, Judy's your go-to. Her details are in your welcome email.

### Workspots & hangouts

* **Desks & phone booths** - no booking system, no hassle. Just grab a spot when you arrive.
* **Visitors:** you're welcome to bring in customers, investors, or anyone else you need to meet with but the space is dedicated to working so we ask you not to bring friends or un-invited YC founders. The space is yours to use - just don't host a house party here.
* **Events:** every few weeks we'll host something in the space. You're welcome to stick around or join in, but we'll always do our best not to disrupt your focus.

## Are you trying to sell me PostHog?

Not at all. Hogpatch is a perk for select YC founders who already know us through the Bookface deal. We know you're focused on building your company, not listening to pitches - so think of this space as a convenient homebase whilst you're hopping around the Dogpatch area, not a sales funnel. We went through YC too, and wanted to create a space that takes off some of the stress whilst you're going through a batch.

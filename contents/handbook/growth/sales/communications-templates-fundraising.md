### **Purpose**

When a PostHog customer raises a new round of funding, gets acquired, or goes public, it’s a major moment for their team. Our goal is to celebrate the milestone in a way that’s *genuine, brief, and human*, not transactional or opportunistic. We avoid product pitches, feature plugs, or follow-up asks in the initial message.

### **1\. Communication principles**

**Keep it human, not salesy**
The first message should feel like a note from one person to another—not a brand announcement. Congratulate them sincerely, acknowledge their achievement, and stop there.

*Example:*
“Massive congrats on the Series C\! I imagine this is a huge moment for you and the team — hope you’re all taking time to celebrate.”

**Timing matters**

* **Day-of:** Congratulatory message (no CTA).
* **\~3–4 weeks later:** Follow-up that references specifics from the company’s press release, interviews, or roadmap to open a thoughtful, relevant conversation.

**Personal \> Personalized**
We avoid template-like phrasing. If we can’t find something personal to say about the customer or their journey, it’s better to say less.

**Channels**

* Slack (preferred, if shared).
* Email (if Slack unavailable).
* Optionally LinkedIn comment/like from company handle (but no DM from AE unless relationship exists).

### **2\. Follow-up framework (3–4 weeks later)**

Use their own public statements as the hook. Reference their goals, product direction, or challenges expressed in press coverage or announcements, and connect them meaningfully to where PostHog can help.

**Structure:**

1. Open by referencing their recent announcement and one or two specifics (quote, metric, or goal).
2. Briefly connect that to how PostHog can support those goals.
3. Ask a question or offer to share something relevant (not a demo or pitch deck).
   *Example:*
   “Hey — congrats again on the Series B\! I read about Heidi’s plans to scale your AI work globally and tackle latency head‑on. We’ve been working on similar challenges at PostHog around speed and reliability for teams deploying AI at scale. Let’s talk about what’s worked for other customers in keeping things fast and cost‑efficient as usage grows — when’s a good time to connect?”

### **3\. Key takeaways**

* **Don’t sell in the moment.** Celebrate authentically.
* **Follow up with relevance.** Use their words, not ours, to frame the value.
* **Keep the tone human, concise, and professional.**
* **When in doubt:** err on the side of sincerity over specificity.

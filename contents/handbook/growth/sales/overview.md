This section of the Handbook covers customers who are interested in our paid cloud or self-hosted [plans](https://posthog.com/pricing). We also have detailed guidance on how to manage sales day-to-day under [Sales Operations](/handbook/growth/sales/sales-operations) and [CRM](/handbook/growth/sales/crm). 

## Strategy

We currently follow a 100% inbound sales model - our approach to [product-led growth](/handbook/strategy/strategy) means that we do not do outbound sales or cold outreach.

Our primary commercial focus is on customer success, not pushing sales through. We work with a smaller number of leads, but we know that the leads we receive are already pre-qualified and genuinely interested in potentially using PostHog. 

## Target customer for hands-on success

We believe that PostHog has the greatest value for the following Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):

- Need to excel at product led growth to remain competitive
- Have budget and savvy engineers are the decision makers
- Have achieved product market fit
- Have products aimed at businesses

In addition, people looking at self-hosting will:
- Need to control their user data
- Want Enterprise features such as SSO Integration or Project permissioning

## Our values

- No sales-y talk - we are direct, open and honest with customers. We share as much as possible publicly, rather than hiding it behind a mandatory demo call. We are honest when we don't know the answer, or if we're not sure that PostHog is the right solution for a customer. 
- Speed - we are frighteningly responsive. If a customer is in a rush, we do our best to work at their pace. We are clear about expectations, and do not promise what we cannot deliver to close a deal. 
- Engineers helping engineers - there is nothing more frustrating than talking to a salesperson who can't give you all the answers. We keep 'let me find out from the team' to an absolute minimum.

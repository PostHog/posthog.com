## We aim to delight

You can build a good company by focusing on getting lots of customers. To build a great company, you must delight your existing customers. This means that the journey doesn't simply end once we sign up a user - even more important is to ensure that PostHog is consistently delivering value for them.

## How we ensure customer delight at PostHog

### It's easy for customers to reach us

We have a few different routes for users to contact us. As an open source company, our bias is towards increasing the bandwidth of communication with our users and making it easy for them to reach us. We do not believe in putting up barriers by saying they can only reach us through a dedicated support email address, for example.

These are the ways in which customers can currently reach us, in order of popularity:

- **Slack** - our active [PostHog Users Slack](https://posthog.com/slack) community frequently post questions, and for [Scale](/pricing#scale) and [Enterprise](/pricing#enterprise) customers, through a dedicated channel on our main company Slack
- **Email** - a user may email hey@posthog.com with a specific support query
- **GitHub** - sometimes users ask about the progress of [certain issues](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) that are important to them

### Tutorials and workshops

Product analytics are only as valuable as the questions you ask. We’re committed to helping teams of all sizes learn how to ask the right questions to grow their product. To this end, we’re constantly producing new content in the form of [tutorials](https://posthog.com/docs/tutorials), [blog posts](https://posthog.com/blog), and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn4mJ4kK5KVSvozJre645LA).

#### Product analytics worksheet
We've created a [Product Metrics Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mXKS08ngcJlbJdaYihikHO7RDY8dbxyChmsUneOwrfw/edit?usp=sharing) that systematically lays out how to define, implement, and track core product and business metrics (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue) all within PostHog.

This worksheet is available for everyone to use and is designed to help all teams (even ones that aren't using PostHog! *yet*).

For [Scale](/pricing#scale) customers, we include a complimentary workshop where we work with all the stakeholders to go through this worksheet, define these metrics, and create dashboards in PostHog.

### No dedicated support people

We intentionally have not hired a single person dedicated to customer support. The direct interaction between our engineering team and our users is _hugely_ valuable, and an important part of building trust in our community is the ability for users to talk directly with the people who are actually building the product.

Providing support is a responsibility shared across our team - we expect everyone to jump in and help a user if you see they have a question or problem (though obviously not at the same time!) Once you have made the initial contact or response, it is your responsibility to see it through or explicitly hand over to someone else if they are better-equipped to help.

This does mean sometimes that, especially when we are particularly busy, customer success can take a bit of a back seat.

This is why, in addition, one person takes on the **[Support Hero](/handbook/engineering/support-hero)** role each two week sprint. This is a rotating responsibility, where the person involved spends a significant chunk of their time responding to support queries across Slack, email and Zendesk, and sharing that feedback with the team and/or building features and fixes in response. We have found that each stint as Support Hero has thrown up a lot of really valuable feedback. 

### Simple, lightweight tools

We go to where our users are. That means **we respond in the same channel that they reached out to**, rather than trying to funnel them somewhere else.

We use [Zendesk Support](https://zendesk.com/) as our internal ticket management platform to get an overview of our support requests. We also use [Help](https://www.atlassian.com/software/halp) to easily create and manage Zendesk tickets straight from the PostHog Users Slack. This ensures that we don't miss anyone, especially when their request is passed from one person to another at PostHog, or if they message us over the weekend. If customer success is part of your role, you should have received an invite to join as part of your onboarding - if you didn't, ask Charles. 

The first time you sign into Zendesk, please make sure you include your name and [profile picture](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team) so our users know who they are chatting to!

There are a few different ways that support tickets can be created in Zendesk:

#### Slack

_User Slack_

- Support requests posted in #community-support are monitored by the [Support Hero](/handbook/engineering/support-hero), who then creates tickets in Zendesk by reacting to the message with the :ticket: trigger emoji. Once created, the Support Hero will triage the request in either Zendesk or directly in Slack via Help, and assign it a priority and owner.

_Dedicated Support Channels_

- Our Customer Success team monitors these channels and creates tickets in Zendesk via a direct Slack integration, and will prioritize and assign them accordingly.

#### Email

- Emails sent to [hey@posthog.com](mailto:hey@posthog.com) automatically create tickets in Zendesk, which are prioritized and delegated by the Support Hero.

#### Zendesk Features

Here are some key features in Zendesk to help you get acquainted:

- _Home page_: From this screen, you can see all open tickets assigned to you that have not yet been replied to. From here, you can edit tickets to add an assignee, a priority, or tags.
- _Views_: Here you can cycle through different lists of tickets including all unassigned and unsolved tickets.
- _Analytics_: 'Reporting' in the left hand panel shows some interesting analytics, such as how many queries we're receiving, average response time, as well as a leaderboard tracking the performance of each Support Hero. We don't report on these yet as we're still figuring out the best way for us to do support.

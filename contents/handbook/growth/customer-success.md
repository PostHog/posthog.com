## We aim to delight

You can build a good company by focusing on getting lots of customers. To build a great company, you must delight your existing customers. This means that the journey doesn't simply end once we sign up a user - even more important is to ensure that PostHog is consistently delivering value for them. 

## How we ensure customer delight at PostHog

### It's easy for customers to reach us

We have a few different routes for users to contact us. As an open source company, our bias is towards increasing the bandwidth of communication with our users and making it easy for them to reach us. We do not believe in putting up barriers by saying they can only reach us through a dedicated support email address, for example. 

These are the ways in which customers can currently reach us:

- **Slack** - our active [PostHog Users Slack](posthogusers.slack.com) community frequently post questions
- **Email** - a user may email hey@ with a specific support query
- **In-app** - we provide in-app support chat via the [Papercups](https://papercups.io/) widget (more on this below)
- **GitHub** - sometimes users ask about the progress of [certain issues](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) that are important to them

### Simple, lightweight tools

We go to where our users are. That means we respond to the same channel that they reached out to, rather than trying to funnel them somewhere else. 

This can result in a bit of inefficiency trying to monitor multiple channels, which is why we use [Papercups](https://papercups.io/) as our internal platform to collate and manage user requests. This ensures that we don't miss anyone, especially when their request is passed from one person to another at PostHog.  

Papercups has some really nice integrations which help us run things more smoothly:

- You can reply directly to PostHog app questions either in Papercups itself or in the _customer_support_ channel in our internal Slack - both work!
- In the users Slack, the _general_ and _feedback_ channels are also synced with Papercups - this means you can reply to users in Slack _or_ Papercups and the two will stay synced. Please make sure you _reply in a thread_ to any questions. This makes it easier for our users to navigate, and also prevents Papercups creating a new conversation for each response (as Papercups treats each thread in Slack as a conversation). 
- You can leave a 'Private Note' in the right hand pane in Papercups if you need to make a note of something for future reference, e.g. a relevant GitHub issue.
- If you click 'Share Conversation' at the bottom of the right hand pane, you can link directly to a conversation.
- 'Reporting' in the left hand panel shows some interesting analytics, such as how many queries we're receiving, average response time etc. 

Papercups are an open source company, so if there are any additional features you'd like to see then you can check out their [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/papercups-io/papercups/issues). They are building new features quickly, so it's worth checking in to see what new functionality is available from time to time.  

### No dedicated support people

We intentionally have not hired a single person dedicated to customer support. The direct interaction between our engineering team and our users is _hugely_ valuable, and an important part of building trust in our community is the ability for users to talk directly with the people who are actually building the product. 

Providing support is a responsibility shared across our team - we expect everyone to jump in and help a user if you see they have a question or problem (though obviously not at the same time!) Once you have made the initial contact or response, it is your responsibility to see it through or explicitly hand over to someone else if they are better-equipped to help. 

This does mean sometimes that, especially when we are particularly busy, customer success can take a bit of a back seat. 

This is why, in addition, one person takes on the Support Hero role each two week sprint. This is a rotating responsibility, where the person involved spends most-to-all of their time responding to support queries across Slack, email and Papercups, and sharing that feedback with the team and/or building features and fixes in response. We have found that each stint as support hero has thrown up a lot of really valuable feedback. 

## Some useful questions to ask

The below questions are evolving so please add more as they come up!

### Set up

- Has the customer logged in?
- Has the customer added their team?
- Are events coming into the platform on a recurring basis?
- Are identify calls being made so user profiles are being created?
- Are additional relevant user properties being sent?
- Has the customer set up actions?
- Has the customer set up funnels?
- Has the customer created or modified a dashboard?
- Has the customer used the toolbar?
- Has the customer gotten PostHog into production?
- If applicable, has the customer removed any test data?
- If applicable, is the customer using feature flags?

### Training and support

- Does their team have enough general product analytics experience?
- Has their team received a demo of the product?
- Has everyone on the team used the product at least once?
- Does the customer's team know where to find our use case guides?
- Have we told the customer where to get support?
- Have we set up a joint Slack channel with the customer?

### Providing more value over time

- Have we added their whole team to our email newsletter?
- Are we monitoring the customer's usage on a dashboard at a team level?
    - Is the customer generally above 80% usage for their current plan?
- Have we set up a quarterly catchup with the customer to talk about roadmap/issues/expansion?
    - Has their team had a good experience asking for help or reporting issues to us?
- Is the customer using PostHog on a weekly / monthly basis?

<br />

We aim to regularly publish content in the form of videos and articles as part of providing value to our community. 

As a result, we have formulated a loose strategy for how to approach publishing the content produced once it is ready to be exposed to the world.

#### Suggested Workflow

0. Make sure the content is actually live: If it is an article, ensure that the changes are reflected on the website following the merge of the pull request, which might take 10 to 30 minutes.
1. Post a link to the article/video on our `#editorial` channel in the PostHog Users Slack group. This group should always the first to hear about new content.
2. Include the article in the **body** of an email and schedule it to be sent the next day via Mailchimp to people in the 'PostHog Newsletter' audience. 
3. Schedule a tweet to be posted 1-2 days later with a link to the content.
4. Consider making a post on HackerNews on the same day as the content goes live on Twitter. Not all posts should go on HN, only the ones that make sense for that specific audience. Videos generally do not do well on HackerNews, for example.
5. Evaluate if the content can also benefit from being published in other mediums, such as LinkedIn, Reddit, or Medium. If unsure, you're generally better to publish it and see what happens.
6. Create an annotation on [app.posthog.com](https://app.posthog.com) about the content release, so that we can determine if it was the cause of any changes in our metrics.

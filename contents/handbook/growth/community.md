## A happy and healthy community is key

Before we do anything else, we must have a thriving community.

## Tools

We use [orbit](https://app.orbit.love) as a way of pulling all our community data into one place.

PostHog Users Slack is the primary hub and is the first place [we put out content](/releasing-content).

We also have people interacting with us in GitHub, over email, and over social media - Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn to a certain extent.

## Giving out merch

### When

We give out free stuff from the PostHog [merch store](https://merch.posthog.com) when we see community members maing a contribution.

This can mean:

* Creating a pull request to the docs or product
* Helping other people in the community out, in GitHub issues or Slack
* Creating a very well thought out issue that helps us improve the product
* Consistently improving the conversations we have in GitHub or Slack over time
* Spreading the word about PostHog.
* People who've gone above and beyond for us generally - contractors or candidates we perhaps didn't hire but could hire eventually.

We are quite limited on who has access. James, Yakko and Paolo currently have logins.

### How

Multiple people can give out stuff. It's important that we can all see what's going on so we don't accidentally give stuff out twice, and so we can work out how effective our spending here is in future.

* Make sure they have an Orbit profile - create one if it doesn't exist.
* Create a gift voucher in [Shopify](https://shopify.com), since this powers our store.
* Add a note in the gift voucher itself saying who it is for - link to their profile in Orbit in the note.
* Add a note to Orbit saying you sent them a voucher and why.
* Tell the community member. It's best to treat this like a gift - you wouldn't give $30 to a friend, but you would give them "a mug". Give a voucher that represents enough for the item and around $15 extra so they'll be able to ship it. Bear in mind shipping costs increase with more stuff as we have lots of suppliers.
* It is up to you to pick how much to give. Anything from $20 to $100 seems reasonable.

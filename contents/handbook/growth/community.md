## A happy and healthy community is key

Before we do anything else, we must have a thriving community.

## Responding to users

* Everyone is a moderator. That includes you! If you see something unanswered, please answer it if you can. If you can't, tag in someone else that is around and can answer.
* Be as specific as possible with answers. "This is coming soon" isn't helpful, whereas "Here is a relevant pull request, you can see we are still working on some merge conflicts next, feel free to follow along" is a good response.
* Assume good intent. Remember that for every user who raises a problem, it's likely that dozens or hundreds of users also had the same problem but didn't take the initiative to ask for help.
* It's common to get asked for when certain features may be available. **Do not** promise delivery dates. As a general practice we don't do this at all since it leads to late nights, stress, and a harder time prioritizing things sensibly. However, **do** give specific information on progress thus far.
* If asked for a specific feature and you aren't immediately sure of its impact, ask the user to create a GitHub issue requesting it, and drop them a link to the right place to do this. That way we can canvas opinions in the community better.

## Tools

We use [Orbit](https://app.orbit.love) as a way of pulling all our community data into one place.

PostHog Users Slack is the primary hub and is the first place [we put out content](/releasing-content).

Within Slack, we use a [Papercups](https://papercups.io/) integration to reply to questions from users who messaged from within the app asking for support.

We also have people interacting with us in GitHub, over email, and over social media - Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn to a certain extent.

## Giving out merch

### When

We give out free stuff from the PostHog [merch store](https://merch.posthog.com) when we see community members making a relevant contribution.

This can mean:

* Creating a useful pull request to the docs or product in line with our contribution guidelines
* Helping other people in the community, in GitHub issues or Slack
* Creating a descriptive, thoughtful, and relevant issue that helps us improve the product
* Consistently improving the conversations we have in GitHub or Slack over time
* Spreading the word about PostHog
* People who've gone above and beyond for us generally - contractors or candidates we perhaps didn't hire but could hire eventually

We are quite limited on who has access. James, Yakko, and Paolo currently have logins.

### How

Multiple people can give out stuff. It's important that we can all see what's going on so we don't accidentally give stuff out twice, and so we can work out how effective our spending here is in future.

* Make sure they have an Orbit profile - create one if it doesn't exist.
* Create a gift voucher in [Shopify](https://shopify.com), since this powers our store.
* Add a note in the gift voucher itself saying who it is for - link to their profile in Orbit in the note. Avoid including personal information and opt to add a link to their profile.
* Add a note to Orbit saying you sent them a voucher and why.
* Tag them on Orbit with the `received merch` tag
* Tell the community member. It's best to treat this like a gift - you wouldn't give $30 to a friend, but you would give them "a mug". Give a voucher that represents enough for the item and around $15 extra so they'll be able to ship it. Bear in mind shipping costs increase with more stuff as we have lots of suppliers.
* It is up to you to pick how much to give. Anything from $20 to $100 seems reasonable.
* We should maximize giving merch to a whole lot of different people instead of a ton of merch to the same group of people.

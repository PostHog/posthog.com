## Press enquiries

Any press-related enquiries should be directed to press@posthog.com. Only James, Tim or Charles should be talking to the press on PostHog's behalf. If someone from the press approaches you, please raise with one of them in the first instance. 

## Managing press releases

From time to time, we may have significant company news that we want to release via the press, in addition to our usual channels. This is usually for significant company milestones such as funding rounds.

We have a simple process to ensure that any press releases go smoothly. 

### First steps

- [ ] Write up objectives and comms strategy - what is the purpose of the press release? What key message(s) are we trying to get across? 
- [ ] Set an approximate target date

### Two weeks before release

- [ ] Confirm key messages and write first draft press release
- [ ] Finalize target date
- [ ] Pitch and secure a media exclusive - our investors can help with this
- [ ] Secure approval for any third party involvement, e.g. quotes we want to use

We currently prefer working with a single media partner on an exclusive basis, as we believe a single, high-quality story is more impactful than taking a broad approach, given our current early stage. 

### One week before release

- [ ] Finalize press release and share with exclusive media partner
- [ ] Any media prep if interviews have been scheduled

### On the day of release

- [ ] *Wait for the media partner's story to go live first!* Check it carefully and ask for any errors to be amended before proceeding with the below...
- [ ] Push out the press release via BusinessWire
- [ ] Submit via YC's social media request from
- [ ] James to post on his personal LinkedIn (and tag all relevant people)
- [ ] Post in our PostHog Users Slack
- [ ] Post in YC Slack
- [ ] Write post on our blog about the news
- [ ] Post on PostHog Twitter (and tag all relevant people)
- [ ] Share links to all of the above to the PostHog team so they can share

## Basic press release guidance

The purpose of a press release is to present our key messages in a clear and understandable way for any interested media to be able to pick up the story. 

A few basic tips:

- [ ] The title and opening couple of sentences are by far the most important sections of the press release. You should spend a disproportionate amount of time writing these.
- [ ] It is tempting to try and cram in lots of messages - don't! Keep it simple - 2 or 3 key messages at the most. A press release does not need to 
- [ ] We will usually want a quote from James or Tim in there, depending on the content. It is also good to include a quote from relevant third parties, e.g. an investor participating in a new round of funding. 
- [ ] Include a press contact at the end - press@posthog.com
- [ ] All press releases should include our boilerplate (this will change over time) - usually this section is titled 'About PostHog':

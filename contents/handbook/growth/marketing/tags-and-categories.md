Note, there are other tags we've used in the past here, but they're largely optional.

## Creating new tags

Creating a new tag is as simple as adding the text to a post – it also means typos can generate new tag pages, so please be observant.

It's best to avoid a proliferation of tags, so please raise an issue before creating a new one.

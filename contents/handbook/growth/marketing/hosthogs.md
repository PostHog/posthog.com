HostHogs are our global series of meetups. The mission of HostHogs is to create an opportunity for the PostHog community to meet like-minded members and benefit from deeper conversations with our team and the community - and to influence our product roadmap with their ideas!

Specific product metrics that this supports (in order):
1. Retention
2. Referral
3. Awareness

## Target audience

We think HostHogs will be of particular interest to people in the following roles at our [target companies](/handbook/strategy/strategy):

- Product Engineer
- Senior/Lead Engineer
- Tech Lead
- Technical Product Manager

## How do we make these valuable for attendees?

- The more specific the content, the better
- Make the content practical and actionable
- Give attendees an avenue for feedback and an ability to influence our roadmap
- Enable them to directly speak to PostHog team members

## Format

Each meetup is ~3 hours long and follows the same format:

1. Talk from a PostHog team member - typically a deep dive into how we're solving a problem or using technologies to do so
2. Guest talk from a member of the community
3. Free time for attendees to chat and meet the PostHog team

We're aiming for 20-40 guests, with around 5 members of the PostHog team also attending.

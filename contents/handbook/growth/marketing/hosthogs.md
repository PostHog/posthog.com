HostHogs are our global series of meetups. The mission of HostHogs is to create an opportunity for the PostHog community to meet like-minded members and benefit from deeper conversations with our team and the community.

Specific product metrics that this supports (in order):

1. Retention
2. Referral
3. Awareness

We expect to organize at least four HostHogs each year, one per quarter. We are still experimenting with the format for HostHog and trying a variety of approaches in different locations, so this page provides guidelines rather than a prescriptive set of tasks. 

## Who to invite to an event

Anyone is welcome to attend a HostHog and we welcome both active users and those who are not yet using PostHog at all. We think HostHogs will be of particular interest to people in the following roles at our [target companies](/handbook/strategy/strategy):

- Product Engineers
- Senior/Lead Engineers
- Tech Leads
- Technical Product Managers
- Software Engineers

## How to make events valuable for attendees

HostHogs give attendees an opportunity to learn more about best practices in their industry, but also to socialize and give feedback to our team. We are still experimenting with the format of HostHogs and some events focus more on education and knowledge sharing, while others may focus more on the social occasion. 

In general, the following principles apply:

- Make the event something our target audience would be interested in attending
- Make and educational content practical, specific and actionable
- Enable attendees to directly speak to PostHog team members

## How to host a HostHog

Each event is ~3 hours long. We aim for 20-40 guests, with around 5-10 members of the PostHog team also attending. PostHog attendees should wear lanyards or badges to clearly identify them as members of the team.

Each event should always start with at least 30 minutes of open time, during which attendees can get a drink and network. This allows for attendees who are running late to arrive. 

Before the main event, there should be an introduction from a PostHog team member who can explain the format of the event and welcome guests. This can be extended to include other content, such as a product demo, if desireable. 

The main event should follow, typically either an interview with a guest speaker or a social event such as a pub quiz. 

Once all events are finished we should allow at least an hour for further networking time, as well as food and drinks. PostHog team members are encouraged to circulate with attendees during this time, gathering feedback and building relationships with the community.

## How to plan a HostHog

Each event is different, however the following deliverables can act as a guide. It is recommended to begin planning at least six weeks before you plan to host the event and to allow at least three weeks for promotion and marketing. 

Where possible, we try to use local suppliers and source merch from sustainable sources which use recycled material and do not involve single-use plastics. 

You will typically need:

- [ ] An event landing page. [We have a template for this](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/developing-the-website#hosthog). 
- [ ] A sign-up page. Eventbrite works well for creating a place where attendees can RSVP. 
- [ ] A venue. Be sure to consider AV requirements. In the UK, [TT Liquor](https://ttliquor.co.uk/) works well. 
- [ ] Some venue signage. Floor signs work well and [we have a template for them.](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues/558)
- [ ] Lanyards for PostHog team members. Check with Team Marketing to see what may already be available. 
- [ ] Merch. Check with Team Marketing to see what merch may already be available and what has historically worked well. 
- [ ] A host. This should someone from the PostHog team who can give an introductory talk.  
- [ ] A main event. Typically this is either a hosted interview (you need a host and a guest) or a social event, such as a pub quiz (you need questions and prizes).
- [ ] Food and drink. Alcoholic drinks are fine. It can be helpful to choose venues which provide food and drink as a package.
- [ ] Internal briefing document. See below.

### The internal briefing document

We strongly recommend writing a short briefing document which can be shared with PostHog team members ahead of the event, to make sure events run smoothly. 

This document should typically explain:

- [ ] A detailed agenda for the event, including when you expect team members to arrive. 
- [ ] Any specific responsibilities for team members, such as recording interviews or transporting merch. 
- [ ] Brief talking points for any talks by PostHog team members
- [ ] Emergency information, including any designated first aiders and fire safety information.
- [ ] Covid-19 guidelines. 
- [ ] Contact information for the organizer on the day. 

### How much to spend

Venue costs can vary depending on locations and capacity required. To control costs, we recommend only booking food and drink packages after the event has been announced and you have some sense of the attendance. 

In addition to venue and food/drink costs, expect to typically spend:

- [ ] Travel and accommodation expenses for PostHog members - up to $500 per person
- [ ] Travel and accommodation expenses for guest (if needed) - up to $500
- [ ] Signage and lanyards - up to $500 if no existing assets are available from Team Marketing
- [ ] Merch - up to $100 per attendee, plus shipping. 

We do not currently expect to organize paid-for guests for our events. 

### What to do after the event

- [ ] Create a new GitHub issue to gather feedback from PostHog attendees.
- [ ] Relay feedback from guests to the entire team via the internal #PostHogFeedback Slack channel.
- [ ] Offset the carbon of any travel by PostHog team members and guests via [Wren](https://www.wren.co/).

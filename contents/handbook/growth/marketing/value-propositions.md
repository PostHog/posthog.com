# Value propositions

Value propositions are the promises we make to our prospective customers about what PostHog does and the value it offers to them.

Value propositions are not intended to be used verbatim, but to be interpreted, referred to and expanded upon. They're useful for checking and creating paid ads or for writing site copy, for example.

PostHog has several value propositions. Each is structured like a story: 

- The **proposition** we make (e.g. _Have more fun at the arcade_)
- The **challenge** before PostHog (e.g. _Most arcade games are for one player_)
- The **experience** of this challenge (e.g. _It's not fun to play on your own_)
- The **solution** PostHog offers (e.g. _Our arcade game has a two-player mode_) 
- The **result** of the solution (e.g. _You'll have twice as much fun_)

Our value propositions also call on our messaging pillars, which map to specific functionality that reinforce the proposition (e.g. _full-size controls for player two_). 

### 1. An all-in-one platform

PostHog offers a suite of product analysis tools, including funnels, heat maps, session recording and more, all in one easy-to-use platform. This enables data and engineering teams to get information faster, without writing any SQL, while less technical teams are also able to self-serve and get answers without needing support.

- **Proposition:** Get all the analysis you need in one place.
- **Challenge:** You have to go between many different tools, often making requests of other teams to get information.
- **Experience:** You aren't able to progress quickly and even simple requests can take a lot of time.
- **Solution:** PostHog is the only product analytics solution that combines tools such as funnels, session recording and feature flags into a single self-serve platform.
- **Result:** Now you can get answers faster and focus on improving your product, rather than writing SQL.


### 2. Retain control & compliance

PostHog is the only analytics platform which enables users to self-host on their own infrastructure. This means they have greater control over who has access to their data and regulatory compliance is a breeze because information never leaves existing systems.

- **Proposition:** Retain control of your data and simplify regulatory compliance by self-hosting on existing systems.
- **Challenge:** You can't understand user behaviour while remaining compliant without sharing data with third-parties.
- **Experience:** You face an increased risk of data breaches, or else are forced to cope without product analytics.
- **Solution:** PostHog's open-source software is entirely transparent and can be deployed to your own infrastructure. 
- **Result:** Now you can get trustworthy product insights without worrying about compliance issues or data breaches. 


### 3. Integrate with data warehouses

PostHog's plugin system works seamlessly with tools such as data warehouses, both for importing and exporting data. This means even non-technical users can analyse data from across their infrastructure with ease and develop a conclusive understanding of user behaviour.  

- **Proposition:** Connect your analytics platform to the rest of your stack, including your data warehouse. 
- **Challenge:** You're unable to fully leverage the potential of your data warehouse, or to run analytics on more than one data source at a time.
- **Experience:** You never see the big picture, just fragments of user behaviour. Your data team becomes a bottleneck for others. 
- **Solution:** PostHog's open-source plugin framework can push and pull data to any tool, including data warehouses. 
- **Result:** Better leverage your data team and get insights from across your entire data infrastructure.

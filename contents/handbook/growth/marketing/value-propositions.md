PostHog's main value proposition, outlined below, is structured like a story: 

- The **proposition** we make (e.g. _Have more fun at the arcade_)
- The **challenge** before PostHog (e.g. _Most arcade games are for one player_)
- The **experience** of this challenge (e.g. _It's not fun to play on your own_)
- The **solution** PostHog offers (e.g. _Our arcade game has a two-player mode_) 
- The **result** of the solution (e.g. _You'll have twice as much fun_)

## An all-in-one platform for product engineers

PostHog offers a suite of product tools for engineers, including analytics, session replay, feature flags, experimentation, data warehouse, and more, all in one easy-to-use platform. This enables engineers on product and data teams to get information faster, while less technical teams are also able to self-serve and get answers without needing support.

- **Proposition:** We help engineers build better products. 
- **Challenge:** You have to go between and integrate many different tools, often making requests of other teams to get information.
- **Experience:** You aren't able to progress quickly and even simple requests can take a lot of time.
- **Solution:** PostHog is the only product solution that combines several useful tools into a single, self-serve platform.
- **Result:** Now you can get answers faster and focus on improving your product. 

That's it. We no longer include our old value propositions for self-hosted (now for hobbyists only) nor integration with data warehouses (as we're building our own).

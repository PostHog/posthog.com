PostHog has 3 value propositions, outlined below in order of importance. Each is structured like a story: 

- The **proposition** we make (e.g. _Have more fun at the arcade_)
- The **challenge** before PostHog (e.g. _Most arcade games are for one player_)
- The **experience** of this challenge (e.g. _It's not fun to play on your own_)
- The **solution** PostHog offers (e.g. _Our arcade game has a two-player mode_) 
- The **result** of the solution (e.g. _You'll have twice as much fun_)

## 1. An all-in-one platform

PostHog offers a suite of product analysis tools, including funnels, heat maps, session recording, feature flags, experimentation, and more, all in one easy-to-use platform. This enables data and engineering teams to get information faster, while less technical teams are also able to self-serve and get answers without needing support.

- **Proposition:** Get all the analysis you need in one place.
- **Challenge:** You have to go between many different tools, often making requests of other teams to get information.
- **Experience:** You aren't able to progress quickly and even simple requests can take a lot of time.
- **Solution:** PostHog is the only product solution that combines several useful tools into a single, self-serve platform.
- **Result:** Now you can get answers faster and focus on improving your product. 

## 2. Integrate with data warehouses

PostHog's app system works seamlessly with tools such as data warehouses, both for importing and exporting data. This means users can analyse data from across their infrastructure with ease and develop a conclusive understanding of user behaviour.  

- **Proposition:** Connect your analytics platform to the rest of your stack, including your data warehouse. 
- **Challenge:** You're unable to fully leverage the potential of your data warehouse, or to run analytics on more than one data source at a time.
- **Experience:** You never see the big picture, just fragments of user behavior. Your data team becomes a bottleneck for others. 
- **Solution:** PostHog's open-source product OS can push and pull data to any tool, including data warehouses. 
- **Result:** Better leverage your data team and get insights from across your entire data infrastructure.

## 3. Retain control & ensure compliance

PostHog is the only product platform which enables users to self-host on their own infrastructure. This means they have greater control over who has access to their data, and makes regulatory compliance is a breeze because information never leaves existing systems. If a customer chooses to host their data with us, we also offer the choice of hosting in the US or Germany. 

- **Proposition:** Retain control of your data and simplify regulatory compliance by self-hosting on existing systems.
- **Challenge:** You can't understand user behavior while remaining compliant without sharing data with third parties.
- **Experience:** You face an increased risk of privacy issues, or else are forced to cope without product analytics.
- **Solution:** PostHog's open-source software is entirely transparent and can be deployed to your own infrastructure. 
- **Result:** Now you can get trustworthy product insights without worrying about privacy issues.

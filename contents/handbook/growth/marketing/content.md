Content is the main pillar of our marketing strategy. Our strategy is to go _deeper_ and create better content as we grow. We don't rely on AI. We don't take content in exchange for links. We don't have arbitrary volume goals.

## Who is our audience?

- **Founders:** Technical and non-technical founders seeking advice on how to run a successful startup. We share what we've learned and curate the best startup advice in our [founders hub](/founders).

- **Product engineers:** Software engineers who want to improve their product skills, understand users, and build successful new products. We share what we've learned and curate useful advice in the [product engineers hub](/product-engineers).

- **PostHog users:** Existing PostHog users who want to develop their skills and learn how to get the most out of PostHog.

- **B2B SaaS companies:** Our ideal customers are B2B SaaS companies who need reliable user data and a simplified data stack. Most of our output is tailored toward B2B use cases.

## What kind of content do we produce?

1. **Opinionated advice** – Articles where we offer a strong point of view on a topic that impacts our audience. Examples include [The Product-Market Fit Game](/founders/product-market-fit-game), [Burning money on paid ads for a dev tool](/founders/dev-marketing-paid-ads), and [How to design your company for speed](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-to-design-your-company-for-speed) 


2. **High intent SEO comparisons** – Articles for people actively considering PostHog, or searching for a product like ours. Examples include comparisons between [PostHog and competing products](/blog/tags/comparisons), guides on the [best alternatives to popular tools](/blog/best-heap-alternatives), and guides to [most popular tools in our segments](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

3. **Helpful evergreen guides:** Articles on topics of interest to our users and potential users. They generally target popular search terms. Examples include [How to measure product-market fit](/founders/measure-product-market-fit), [The AARRR pirate funnel explained](/product-engineers/aarrr-pirate-funnel), and [8 annoying A/B testing mistakes every engineer should know](/product-engineers/ab-testing-mistakes).

4. **Engineering tutorials:** – Guides on how to do specific things in PostHog. These can be for existing PostHog users, or aimed at potential users who are trying to solve a specific problem. Some, like [How to set up Python A/B testing](/tutorials/python-ab-testing) are SEO focused. Others, like [How to show a survey after a delay](/tutorials/delayed-survey), focus on specific PostHog user pain points.

5. **Newsletters:** – Our newsletter, [Product for Engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com), is both a distribution channel and its own content category. Issues often curate or summarize our existing content, or that of others, into an easy to digest, snackable format. 

### Good to knows

- The marketing team is responsible for all the above – mostly Andy, Ian, and Lior, but James Hawkins, Joe and Charles also contribute. The Website & Docs team owns our [reference documentation](/docs). 

- You can view planned content on the [Marketing project board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/8?card_filter_query=label%3Acontent) using the "content" label filter. All planned content should have an issue.

- Join our [#content-ideas Slack channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C015CRUQR7Y) to share ad-hoc ideas.

Content is the main pillar of our marketing strategy. Our strategy is to go _deeper_ and create better content as we grow. We don't rely on AI. We don't take content in exchange for links. We don't have arbitrary volume goals.

## Who is our audience?

- **Founders:** Technical and non-technical founders seeking advice on how to run a successful startup. We share what we've learned and curate the best startup advice in our [founders hub](/founders).

- **Product engineers:** Software engineers who want to improve their product skills, understand users, and build successful new products. We share what we've learned and curate useful advice in the [product engineers hub](/product-engineers).

- **PostHog users:** Existing PostHog users who want to develop their skills and learn how to get the most out of PostHog.

- **B2B SaaS companies:** Our ideal customers are B2B SaaS companies who need reliable user data and a simplified data stack. Most of our output is tailored toward B2B use cases.

## What kind of content do we produce?

1. **Opinionated advice** – Articles where we offer a strong point of view on a topic that impacts our audience. Examples include [The Product-Market Fit Game](/founders/product-market-fit-game), [Burning money on paid ads for a dev tool](/founders/dev-marketing-paid-ads), and [How to design your company for speed](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-to-design-your-company-for-speed) 

2. **High intent SEO comparisons** – Articles for people actively considering PostHog, or searching for a product like ours. Examples include comparisons between [PostHog and competing products](/blog/tags/comparisons), guides on the [best alternatives to popular tools](/blog/best-heap-alternatives), and guides to [most popular tools in our segments](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

3. **Helpful evergreen guides:** Articles on topics of interest to our users and potential users. They generally target popular search terms. Examples include [How to measure product-market fit](/founders/measure-product-market-fit), [The AARRR pirate funnel explained](/product-engineers/aarrr-pirate-funnel), and [8 annoying A/B testing mistakes every engineer should know](/product-engineers/ab-testing-mistakes).

4. **Engineering tutorials:** – Guides on how to do specific things in PostHog. These can be for existing PostHog users, or aimed at potential users who are trying to solve a specific problem. Some, like [How to set up Python A/B testing](/tutorials/python-ab-testing) are SEO focused. Others focus on specific PostHog user pain points.

5. **Newsletters:** – Our newsletter, [Product for Engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com), is both a distribution channel and its own content category. Issues often curate or summarize our existing content, or that of others, into an easy-to-digest, snackable format. 

## Content distribution

So you've written a great piece of content. Now what? Here are various ways to spread the word:

### 1. LinkedIn

Share a post using either your own account or the company account, but note that the company account will have dramatically less reach than your personal one. To post using the company account, use [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) (ask <TeamMemberLink squeakId="andy-vandervell" /> to add you to it if you don't have access).

Tips for writing a good post:
- Don't just share the link. Write out an intriguing summary or introduction of the post. Here's a [good example](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257340218159116289).
- Keep in the link in the main post, and don't do that annoying thing of saying "link is in the comments".
- Attach a compelling image to the post. [Example](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7256742630804307968).
  - You can create nice images when clicking **Add entry** in the [changelog](/changelog/). It's under the **Social sharing** header.

### 2. Twitter / X

Again, use Buffer to post from the company account.

Tips for writing a good post:
- Write a brief summary of the post while sharing as much content as possible in it. [Good example](https://x.com/posthog/status/1851571551314825375).
- Attach an image to the post (don't really on the link's social graph preview). Again, you can use **Add entry** in the [changelog](/changelog/) to create a nice image.
- Do your best not to sound "corporate" or serious. Authenticity is appreciated on Twitter. Have fun with it!

### 3. Paid ads + newsletters

You can promote your post by buying sponsored slots in newsletters. <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" /> has a list of newsletters and booked slots we can use to promote content. See [sponsorships](/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship) for more.

If you want to run a paid ad campaign on Reddit, Google, or Twitter, see the [paid ads page](/handbook/growth/marketing/paid-ads).

It's a good idea to create an issue highlighting what you'd like to achieve in your campaign. Here's an [example](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/9646)

## Good to knows

- The marketing team is responsible for all the above – mostly Andy, Ian, and Lior, but James Hawkins, Joe, and Charles also contribute. The Website & Docs team owns our [reference documentation](/docs). 

- You can view planned content on the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/8?card_filter_query=label%3Acontent">Marketing project board</PrivateLink> using the "content" label filter. All planned content should have an issue.

- Join our [#content-ideas Slack channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C015CRUQR7Y) to share ad-hoc ideas.

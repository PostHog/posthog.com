We do three types of sponsorships - commercial, charitable, and open source. Our objectives with commercial sponsorships are to:

- Enhance word of mouth - this is our most effective acquisition channel
- Reach more relevant communities, especially those users that are not active on social media
- Make more effective use of our budget in less popular channels 

Measuring attribution directly is basically impossible with sponsorship activities, so we try hard to make sure we are targeting the right channels by validating opportunities properly first. One way we do this is to ask engineers on the team who are close to our target user for their personal recommendations for content they know and like. 

## Commercial sponsorship

We currently sponsor a mixture of newsletters and podcasts. We do these sponsorships ad hoc, e.g. if we have a particular product launch to support, or if we are trying to drive more newsletter signups. We've tried YouTube a couple of times but they were extremely expensive and the audience isn't technical enough. 

Where possible, we default to an audience we know is as close to 100% engineers as possible, rather than a massive audience where engineers are a smaller %.  

Current list of partners that we like working with:

- [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/)
- [Pointer](https://www.pointer.io/) (ongoing - we publish blog content there)
- [Bytes](https://bytes.dev/), [React newsletter](https://reactnewsletter.com/) (same publisher for both)
- [Tech Lead Digest](https://techleaddigest.net/), [Programming Digest](https://programmingdigest.net/) (same publisher for both)
- [Software Lead Weekly](https://softwareleadweekly.com/)
- [Architecture Notes](https://architecturenotes.co/)

Smaller newsletters that we also have supported:

- [Level Up](https://levelup.patkua.com/)
- [Console](https://console.dev/)
- [FOSS Weekly](https://fossweekly.beehiiv.com/) (same publisher as Console) 

Expensive podcasts we've done one-off which we'd do again:

- [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/)
- [Data Engineering podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/)

Charles and Ian have the contacts for these people if you want to email them. 

### Copy bank

We maintain [a sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOwyDs8qmXw38KgCiPeJMIGS-SedSAZLXfb2zvB_1jE/edit#gid=0) of various types and lengths of copy that we use for our campaigns - if you end up creating new copy, please add it to this sheet!

## Charitable sponsorship

We are looking to partner with charities who are aligned with our mission of increasing the number of successful products in the world. These partners are likely to focus on giving greater access to under-represented groups in tech.  

We currently sponsor:

- [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/) - $500/month
- [Transtech](https://transtechsocial.org/) - $390/month

## Open source sponsorship

PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform built on top of many other amazing open-source projects. We believe in open-source and the [open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model). However, many open-source projects go underfunded.

We are investing in open-source, not just as a business, but directly via sponsorship in key projects we benefit from every day. We're doing this for three reasons:

1. We want valuable open-source projects to continue to be maintained and enhanced
2. We fundamentally rely on some open-source projects, and it's essential they continue to be maintained and enhanced
3. We believe the PostHog brand will benefit from the sponsorship

In addition to sponsoring key projects, we also provide a $100/month budget for [every team member to sponsor projects](/handbook/people/spending-money#open-source-sponsorship-for-individuals) that have helped them.

### Request sponsorship

If you know of a project that is fundamentally important to PostHog, add the project to this page via a PR and tag Charles. If we decide to sponsor, we can set up the sponsorship via either Open Collective or GitHub. To get an invite to Open Collective, create an account first with your posthog.com email address and then ask Charles to invite you. 

Anyone on the PostHog team can do this!

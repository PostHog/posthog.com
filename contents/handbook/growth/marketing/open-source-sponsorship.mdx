We do three types of sponsorships - commercial, charitable, and open source.

Measuring attribution directly is basically impossible with sponsorship activities, so we try hard to make sure we are targeting the right channels by validating opportunities properly first. We like to make sure their target audience is in [our ICP](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for) and test with smaller amounts when possible.

## Commercial sponsorship

Although we've done a variety of commercial sponsorships, including [newsletter ads](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter), podcasts, and billboards, we're mostly focused on sponsoring [influencers](/handbook/growth/marketing/influencers) to drive awareness and signups to PostHog.

We track these sponsorships in our <PrivateLink url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MmNUd9fFlZM3-SDk-HQ9cOmBY8XtqT7F97JFOAehxh8/edit?gid=702711155#gid=702711155">marketing budget and spending spreadsheet</PrivateLink>.

<TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" /> has the contacts for these people if you want them.

### Influencers

See [influencers](/handbook/growth/marketing/influencers).

### Podcasts

We've sponsored podcasts one-off in the past, but have no plans to do them again at the moment. They include:

- [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/)
- [Data Engineering podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/)

### Newsletter ads

We sponsored a variety of newsletters to drive subscriptions for our newsletter, [Product for Engineers](/handbook/content-and-docs/newsletter), but have put that on pause as we revaluate the quality of the subscriptions we're getting.

## Charitable sponsorship

We are looking to partner with charities who are aligned with our mission of increasing the number of successful products in the world. These partners are likely to focus on giving greater access to under-represented groups in tech.  

We currently sponsor:

- [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/) - $500/month
- [Transtech](https://transtechsocial.org/) - $390/month

## Open source sponsorship

PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform built on top of many other amazing open-source projects. We believe in open-source and the [open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model). However, many open-source projects go underfunded.

We are investing in open-source, not just as a business, but directly via sponsorship in key projects we benefit from every day. We're doing this for three reasons:

1. We want valuable open-source projects to continue to be maintained and enhanced
2. We fundamentally rely on some open-source projects, and it's essential they continue to be maintained and enhanced
3. We believe the PostHog brand will benefit from the sponsorship

In addition to sponsoring key projects, we also provide a $100/month budget for [every team member to sponsor projects](/handbook/people/spending-money#open-source-sponsorship-for-individuals) that have helped them.

### Request sponsorship

If you know of a project that is fundamentally important to PostHog, add the project to this page via a PR and tag Charles. If we decide to sponsor, we can set up the sponsorship via either Open Collective or GitHub. To get an invite to Open Collective, create an account first with your posthog.com email address and then ask Charles to invite you. 

Anyone on the PostHog team can do this!

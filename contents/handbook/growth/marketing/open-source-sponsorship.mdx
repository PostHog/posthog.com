We do three types of sponsorships - commercial, charitable, and open source.

Measuring attribution directly is basically impossible with sponsorship activities, so we try hard to make sure we are targeting the right channels by validating opportunities properly first. We like to make sure their target audience is in [our ICP](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for) and test with smaller amounts when possible.

## Commercial sponsorship

Our current objectives with commercial sponsorships are to:

1. Drive subscriptions to our [newsletter](/handbook/content/newsletter) [Product for Engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com/)
2. Create awareness, enhance word of mouth, and drive signups to PostHog

To do this, we sponsor a mixture of newsletter and influencer sponsorships. Where possible, we default to an audience we know is as close to 100% engineers as possible, rather than a massive audience where engineers are a smaller %.

We track these sponsorships in our <PrivateLink url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MmNUd9fFlZM3-SDk-HQ9cOmBY8XtqT7F97JFOAehxh8/edit?gid=702711155#gid=702711155">marketing budget and spending spreadsheet</PrivateLink>.

<TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" /> has the contacts for these people if you want them.

### Influencers

We sponsor influencers to drive awareness and signups to PostHog. We look for ones who are already PostHog users and have large, engaged audiences (on social, Discord, YouTube comments). 

We find that spending more money on larger influencers converts better than sponsoring many smaller ones. We experimented with short-form video, but it was difficult to measure and didn't convert well.

Some of the influencers we sponsor include:

- [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xXSsu0YXWo). He is a great partner for us. His audience is ideal, he is doing YouTube right, and he's a PostHog user.

- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)

- [Chris Raroque](https://www.youtube.com/@raroque)

We measure impact by looking at clicks on the custom link as well as <PrivateLink url="https://us.posthog.com/project/2/insights/jdJgByZC">where people hear about us on signup</PrivateLink>. This is tracked between PostHog and our <PrivateLink url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MmNUd9fFlZM3-SDk-HQ9cOmBY8XtqT7F97JFOAehxh8/edit?gid=702711155#gid=702711155">marketing budget and spending spreadsheet</PrivateLink>.

#### Influencer sponsorship content

As guidance for what the ad should look like, we ask the following:

- Be at least 45 seconds long
- Be included in the first 2 minutes of the video
- Custom link that redirects to UTM URL in the top 3 lines of the description
- Mention you heard about PostHog from them

Beyond this, we are flexible and suggest that influencers talk about how they use PostHog.

### Podcasts

We've sponsored podcasts one-off in the past, but have no plans to do them again at the moment. They include:

- [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/)
- [Data Engineering podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/)

## Charitable sponsorship

We are looking to partner with charities who are aligned with our mission of increasing the number of successful products in the world. These partners are likely to focus on giving greater access to under-represented groups in tech.  

We currently sponsor:

- [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/) - $500/month
- [Transtech](https://transtechsocial.org/) - $390/month

## Open source sponsorship

PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform built on top of many other amazing open-source projects. We believe in open-source and the [open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model). However, many open-source projects go underfunded.

We are investing in open-source, not just as a business, but directly via sponsorship in key projects we benefit from every day. We're doing this for three reasons:

1. We want valuable open-source projects to continue to be maintained and enhanced
2. We fundamentally rely on some open-source projects, and it's essential they continue to be maintained and enhanced
3. We believe the PostHog brand will benefit from the sponsorship

In addition to sponsoring key projects, we also provide a $100/month budget for [every team member to sponsor projects](/handbook/people/spending-money#open-source-sponsorship-for-individuals) that have helped them.

### Request sponsorship

If you know of a project that is fundamentally important to PostHog, add the project to this page via a PR and tag Charles. If we decide to sponsor, we can set up the sponsorship via either Open Collective or GitHub. To get an invite to Open Collective, create an account first with your posthog.com email address and then ask Charles to invite you. 

Anyone on the PostHog team can do this!

Accessible content with jokes, memes and gifs have done well.

## Successful Hacker News topics

A successful post on Hacker News can currently increase traffic by 5-10%.

## PostHog Array

The PostHog Array is our product release series.

It's named the PostHog Array, because hedgehogs are collectively known as an *array* of hedgehogs.

Yakko adds new items to the Array ;) by gathering changes and highlights from PRs and the engineering team.

Each array includes:
- a community MVP
- a summary of new features, improvements and fixes
- important announcements e.g. deprecations
- detailed overview of each change with an image/video
- community shoutout for other contributors
- open roles
- complete list of PRs included

Before merging and distributing the release post, check with Tim that the new version has been released.

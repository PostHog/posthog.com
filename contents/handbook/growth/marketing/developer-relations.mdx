As a developer-focused company offering a product that, in most cases, will require at least *some* developer involvement (and sometimes a lot of it!), Developer Relations is an important area to us.

Beyond being a developer-focused product, an appropriate PostHog setup requires that the customer, at a minimum, integrate a PostHog library into their codebase. Additionally, engineers may also step in to:

- Deploy and maintain a self-hosted instance of PostHog
- Configure integrations with other services
- Export data from PostHog (e.g. via API)
- Add data into PostHog from third-party services
- Build a plugin for PostHog
- Run queries directly against the PostHog database (when self-hosting)

Finally, as an open core company with a large and well-established MIT-licensed offering, we are also in close contact with developers via:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Pull requests

As a result, developers/engineers are a core part of our userbase and community, making them a key component of our success. 

Thus, this page will provide some insight into what Developer Relations at PostHog entails, with a particular focus on Developer Experience, the only subsection of DevRel that we currently have a specific role for.


## Making Sense of DevRel

Developer Relations is a confusing space, with a lot of controversy and disagreements about taxonomy.

For us, the most important thing is that we have our own structure for conceptualizing this, rather than seeking an absolute truth - at the end of the day, every company approaches DevRel differently.

At PostHog, we see "Developer Relations" as the overarching field encompassing most of our interactions with developers as a company, be it via our product, direct contact with our team, or even an ad.

### Where we're at today

Here are some general areas at PostHog that fall under the umbrella of "Developer Relations", and who currently performs them:

|                Area                 |   Team(s) currently responsible   |
| :---------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
|   Core Product (Developer Tools)    | Engineering, Developer Experience |
|             Deployments             |            Engineering            |
|              Libraries              | Engineering, Developer Experience |
|          Technical Support          | Engineering, Developer Experience |
|      Integrations (+ Plugins)       | Developer Experience, Engineering |
|            Documentation            |       Developer Experience        |
|              Tutorials              |       Developer Experience        |
|         Developer Education         | Not really done beyond tutorials  |
|         Developer Marketing         |             Marketing             |
| Top of funnel content (dev-focused) |      Marketing, James (CEO)       |
|               Events                |        Marketing, Founders        |
|             User demos              |       Developer Experience        |
|        Community Management         | Developer Experience, Engineering |
|           User Interviews           |       Product, Engineering        |


A lot of the roles that are linked to "Developer Relations" are actually performed by "other teams" - and that's not only fine, it's encouraged. 

Ultimately, for a dev-focused company, Developer Relations is bound to be a responsibility of everyone - albeit to largely varying degrees.

At PostHog, we also have [engineers throughout the company](/handbook/company/values#everyone-codes) - our CEO, Lead Designer, and Marketing Lead are all developers. This means that these responsibilities can comfortably be shared around teams instead of falling specifically under a Developer Relations team.

### Names and stuff...

However, as we grow, a DevRel team might make sense for us. As such, it's useful to think about some of the roles that would fit into this team.

To do so, let's borrow a definition from a [blog post from Slack](https://slack.engineering/defining-a-career-path-for-developer-relations/), which says:

*"Developer Relations (DevRel) is an interdisciplinary role that sits in a border space between product, engineering, and marketing."*

This definition may not be the exact truth, but it gives us a framework to conceptualize how some common DevRel roles might fit *at PostHog*:

![Developer Relations Matrix](../../images/handbook/devrel-matrix.png)

Here, Engineering was added just for context, and there are also some notable omissions, such as Developer Educator, Developer Community Manager, Technical Writer, among others.

But let's make sense of this diagram:

#### Axes

On the Y-Axis we have "Product" at the top and "Periphery" at the bottom. "Periphery" encompasses everything that isn't necessarily the *core* product but is also a key component of our offering. This includes stuff like libraries, plugins, integrations, etc.

On the X-Axis we have "Engineering" on the left, which is rather self-explanatory: it encompasses the actual process of building things. On the other hand, we have "Marketing / Non-Engineering", which is an extension to the Slack definition to encompass non-Engineering tasks that also aren't Marketing, such as support, demos, and documentation.

#### Roles

##### Engineering

Pretty straight forward - the team building our core product.

##### Developer Experience

This will vary a lot based on the type of company. Depending on the type of company, the line between UX and DX can become increasingly blurry (e.g. when **all** users are developers), and so Developer Experience might go deeper into product than it does at PostHog, for example. 

For us, DX relates to improving the end-to-end experience for an engineer using (and/or building) our product. More on this later.

##### Developer Advocacy and Evangelism

The terms "Developer Advocate" and "Developer Evangelist" are often used interchangeably to refer to the external-facing developers that do things like:

- Speak at events
- Create demos
- Run workshops
- Interact with the community 
- Write technical content
- Maintain documentation
- Building integrations

These are the roles that are often described as an intersection of Engineering and Marketing, composed of individuals that are "developers with great soft skills".

Here, we've placed Evangelism a step further from Engineering than Advocacy, which is in line with how others view this. However, the line between these roles is certainly blurry.

##### AAR

At PostHog we [tread on each other's toes](/handbook/company/values#tread-on-toes). But having an idea of areas of responsibility is important.

As such, here's how the DevRel roles might fit into the first three steps of the AARRR framework, which we use for our growth metrics:

![DevRel AAR](../../images/handbook/aar.png)

_Please note that this diagram excludes all the other teams at play here, such as Engineering, Product, Growth, and Marketing. It is specific to roles within DevRel._

With this framework we are able to get a better sense of how to divide up responsibilities, deriving that, for example, tasks related to acquisition should probably be the responsibility of a Developer Advocate, while retention-related work is most likely to fall to a DX Engineer.

### Developer Experience

Out of the roles mentioned above, the only one we currently have (on paper) is Developer Experience. The role is currently rather broad - are as most of our roles at this stage, given our scale.

We do have developer advocacy efforts, but these are mostly led by our Marketing team (which is nevertheless led by a developer).

#### Responsibilities

Today, our DX Engineer (yours truly), is responsible for the following areas, being the primary person responsible for some and an additional contributor to others:

|                  Area                  | Is primary person responsible? |
| :------------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|                  Docs                  |              Yes               |
|               Tutorials                |              Yes               |
|           Demos/Onboardings            |              Yes               |
|         Open Source Community          |              Yes               |
|              New Releases              |              Yes               |
|         Plugins (Integrations)         |              Yes               |
|           Plugins (Tooling)            |               No               |
|       Product Improvements/Fixes       |               No               |
|               Libraries                |               No               |
|           Technical Support            |               No               |
| Feeding user feedback into the product |               No               |
| Building/maintaining marketing website |               No               |

As someone who uses and develops on PostHog daily, I am primarily concerned with PostHog having an excellent end-to-end experience for:

- Users (who are developers)
- Contributors (including our own team)

#### Sprint Structure

DX sprints follow our Engineering schedule and happen every 2 weeks. They will often focus on one specific theme like "Plugins" or "Community".

The time is split roughly as follows:

##### Demos: 10-30%

Inbound demo requests and YC company onboardings.

##### Building: 50-80%

- Building plugins
- Fixing bugs and adding features to the core product and libraries
- Updates to the website
- Tooling
- Lending a hand where needed

##### Support: 5-10%

- General user support
- Support for onboarded companies
- Enterprise support
- Community support
##### Writing: 10-20%

- New tutorials
- Docs for new features
- Updating documentation

#### Measuring Success

Measuring the success of DX is hard to quantify, similarly to UX.

However, there are metrics we can and should keep track of. Here are some examples:


|       Area        |                                        Example Metrics                                        |             Is this currently tracked?             |
| :---------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
|       Docs        | "Was this page helpful" survey results, aggregate usage metrics (search, autofill, dark mode) |                        Yes                         |
| Demos/Onboardings |                                     Conversion, Retention                                     | Retention is tracked, conversion is tracked poorly |
|     Community     |   [Love](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model), aggregate contribution metrics, stars    |           Yes, but could be done better            |
|      Plugins      |                                         Plugin usage                                          |                        Yes                         |
|     Tutorials     |                 Aggregate metrics, conversion (e.g. to discovered learnings)                  |                      Somewhat                      |

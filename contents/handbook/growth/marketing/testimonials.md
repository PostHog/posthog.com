We speak to our users regularly and are often fortunate enough that they say nice things about our product or our way of working. Other times users talk about us in public, such as on social media or on review platforms and forums. 

Not all of the feedback we receive can be used publicly. We don't assume that comments from [product feedback calls](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/user-feedback) can be used without explicit approval, for example, though [approved customer stories](https://posthog.com/customers), public reviews and social media comments certainly can. 

If feedback can be used publicly then we collect it here, so that we can use it elsewhere to enhance our website or docs.

We’ll often share information that’s important with each other directly. Our biggest power user is probably Brandon, the CEO, who is sort of addicted to PostHog - but it’s also popular with the developers too." |

They very valuable though, because you can often use feature flag data to make other product decisions." |

It lets you use your own database and it was really easy to deploy and get going." |

We can enable feature flags per instance,  dark launch features for a specific instance, or implement kill switches or ops flags. Group Analytics also give us more detailed insight into user behaviour between instances. We love it!" |

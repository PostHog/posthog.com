We speak to our users regularly and are often fortunate enough that they say nice things about our product or our way of working. Other times users talk about us in public, such as on social media or on review platforms and forums. 

Not all of the feedback we receive can be used publicly. We don't assume that comments from [product feedback calls](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/user-feedback) can be used without explicit approval, for example, though [approved customer stories](https://posthog.com/customers), public reviews and social media comments certainly can. 

If feedback can be used publicly then we collect it here, so that we can use it elsewhere to enhance our website or docs.

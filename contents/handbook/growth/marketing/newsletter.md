Our newsletter is called Product for Engineers. It's owned by Andy. 

Sent and managed via [Substack](https://newsletter.posthog.com/), we put together an issue planning content for each installment of the newsletter. One person writes it and Andy edits and publishes it.

The newsletter is long-form, original copy, often based on blog posts we already wrote. It focuses on product and business lessons and information for engineers. 

We are currently testing new advertising channels to drive subscriptions for this newsletter.

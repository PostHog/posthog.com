We are in the process of putting together an updated regular newsletter. This is sent via Mailchimp. The Growth team use email for onboarding and other email flows, but this page covers marketing only. 

## Lists

We currently grow our general email list from three sources:
- Newsletter signups from the website
- PostHog users who opt-in
- Event attendees

We send a newsletter called the PostHog Array after every product release (2-4 weeks) and include a summary of the new version and any recent news or blog posts.  

## Newsletter format

Our current newsletter structure looks roughly as follows:
- Title/Heading
- Array's `featuredImage` used in the blog post for the update
- List of #New and #Improved features
- Screenshot of one of the new/improved features - ideally the same image used in the array post
- List of new blog posts or other news, with blurbs and links
- Roles we're currently hiring for
- Social media links

Feel free to use a few emojis and 1-2 images.

For reference, here's an [example](https://us19.campaign-archive.com/?e=__test_email__&u=292207b434c26e77b45153b96&id=a60742692b) of a previous newsletter.

Note: Within the Mailchimp dashboard, users are automatically tagged to indicate where they came from e.g. Newsletter Subscribers, Deployed PostHog, Eventbrite, etc.

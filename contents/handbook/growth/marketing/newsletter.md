We publish two newsletters:

1. PostHog Array, a product announcement email published every four weeks
2. HogMail, a marketing and content email published every two weeks

Both emails are sent via Mailchimp. We plan to move HogMail to a weekly schedule once we're confident we can produce it to a high standard at that higher frequency. It's primarily aimed at existing users as a means to improving engagement with our content and aid product discovery through sharing tutorials, tips and ideas, not user acquisition.

## Lists

We currently grow our general email list from three sources:

- Newsletter signups from the website
- PostHog users who opt-in
- Event attendees

Note: Within the Mailchimp dashboard, users are automatically tagged to indicate where they came from e.g. Newsletter Subscribers, Deployed PostHog, Eventbrite, etc.

## PostHog Array format

Our current newsletter structure looks roughly as follows:
- Title/Heading
- Array's `featuredImage` used in the blog post for the update
- List of #New and #Improved features
- Screenshot of one of the new/improved features - ideally the same image used in the array post
- List of new blog posts or other news, with blurbs and links
- Roles we're currently hiring for
- Social media links

Feel free to use a few emojis and 1-2 images.

For reference, here's an [example](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-32-0) of a previous newsletter.

## HogMail format

HogMail roughly follows this format:

- Featured content comprising at least one blog post and one tutorial
- Curated third-party content we think will interest our users 
- PostHog news, feedback requests and community updates
- The Needle comic / cartoon from Lottie

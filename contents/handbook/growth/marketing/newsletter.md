Speak to James, Yakko, or Mo for access to our Mailchimp dashboard.

## Lists

We currently grow our general email list from three sources:
- Newsletter signups from the website
- PostHog users who opt-in
- Event attendees

We send a newsletter after every product release (2-4 weeks) and include a summary of the new version and any recent news or blog posts. 

We aim to include at least one new blog post in every newsletter - ideally 2-4 per edition.

## Newsletter format

Our current newsletter structure looks roughly as follows:
- Title/Heading
- List of #New and #Improved features
- Screenshot of one of the new/improved features - ideally the same image used in the array post
- List of new blog posts or other news, with blurbs and links
- Roles we're currently hiring for
- Social media links

Feel free to use a few emojis and 1-2 images.

For reference, here's an [example](https://us19.campaign-archive.com/?e=__test_email__&u=292207b434c26e77b45153b96&id=a60742692b) of a previous newsletter.

Note: Within the Mailchimp dashboard, users are automatically tagged to indicate where they came from e.g. Newsletter Subscribers, Deployed Posthog, Eventbrite, etc.

### Investors

We regularly send two emails. 

1. What's New In PostHog?, a product announcement email sent every month. Sent via Customer.io.
2. HogMail, a marketing and content email published every two weeks.

We plan to move HogMail to a weekly schedule once we're confident we can produce it to a high standard at that frequency. It's primarily aimed at existing users as a means to improving engagement with our content and aid product discovery through sharing tutorials, tips and ideas, not user acquisition.

### What's New In PostHog

The What's New In PostHog? email is part of [the new release process](/handbook/engineering/release-new-version) and is used for [product announcements](/handbook/growth/marketing/product-announcements).

Every month, on the last Wednesday/Thursday of the month, we use Customer.io to share a broadcast titled 'What's New In PostHog?'

## HogMail

HogMail roughly follows this format:

- Featured content comprising at least one blog post and one tutorial
- Curated third-party content we think will interest our users 
- PostHog news, feedback requests and community updates
- The Needle comic / cartoon from Lottie

We publish two newsletters:

1. PostHog Array, a product announcement email published every four weeks
2. PostHog News (working title), a marketing and content email published every two weeks

Both emails are sent via Mailchimp. PostHog News (working title) is a work-in-progress newsletter which we plan to increase to a weekly schedule once we're confident we can produce it to a high standard at that higher frequency. PostHog News is primarily aimed at existing users as a means to improving engagement with our content and aid product discovery through sharing tutorials, tips and ideas, not user acquisition.

## Lists

We currently grow our general email list from three sources:

- Newsletter signups from the website
- PostHog users who opt-in
- Event attendees

Note: Within the Mailchimp dashboard, users are automatically tagged to indicate where they came from e.g. Newsletter Subscribers, Deployed PostHog, Eventbrite, etc.

## PostHog Array format

Our current newsletter structure looks roughly as follows:
- Title/Heading
- Array's `featuredImage` used in the blog post for the update
- List of #New and #Improved features
- Screenshot of one of the new/improved features - ideally the same image used in the array post
- List of new blog posts or other news, with blurbs and links
- Roles we're currently hiring for
- Social media links

Feel free to use a few emojis and 1-2 images.

For reference, here's an [example](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-32-0) of a previous newsletter.

## PostHog News format (working title)

The format of the newsletter is still in development, but could/should include the following elements:

- A new piece of fun hedgehog artwork
- Featured content comprising at least one blog post and one tutorial
- Tip/idea of the week to aid discovery  
- PostHog news and product updates, including any updates we've made to documentation
- Requests for comments on open PRs and issues we'd like feedback on1
- Community section highlighting and celebrating community contributors
- Promotion of upcoming events, virtual and in-person

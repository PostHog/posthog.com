If you have a general marketing question, go to `#team-marketing` in Slack.

If you need help with the website, go to `#posthogdotcom`.

Here's a quick guide to who to ask if you want help with a specific marketing activity.

<details>
<summary>I want to send an email to a lot of users</summary>

We run email campaigns through Customer.io. Speak to <TeamMember name="Joe Martin" /> to get started. See: [Email comms](/handbook/brand/email-comms)
</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm interested in running, attending, or speaking at an event</summary>

You should speak to <TeamMember name="Daniel Zaltsman" />, our resident "party planner". Read the [events strategy handbook](/handbook/marketing/events) for more. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>I want to launch my product out of beta</summary>

Speak to <TeamMember name="Joe Martin" /> and read [Product launches](/handbook/brand/product-announcements).
</details>

<details>
<summary>I need help with documentation</summary>

Your main contact is the <SmallTeam slug="docs-wizard" />, but please read the [docs ownership handbook](/handbook/docs-and-wizard/docs-ownership) to understand how best to work with them. 

If you just need someone to review something, tag `Team Docs & Wizard` in GitHub.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Someone wants to write a guest post / is requesting a backlink etc.</summary>

Unless it's someone huge and important with a real audience, "Mark as spam" and "Move to bin". 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Someone wants to partner with us</summary>

Refer them to <TeamMember name="Joe Martin" />. He'll give them the bad news / explore any opportunities.

If another company is interested in building an integration with PostHog, raise this with our integrations engineer.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Someone wants us to sponsor them</summary>

If it's an [influencer](/handbook/growth/marketing/influencers), newsletter or podcast, refer them to <TeamMember name="Adlet Smykov" />.

</details>


<details>
<summary>I want to create a video, or have a video idea we should try...</summary>

To start with, post ideas in the `#content-and-video-ideas` Slack channel. <TeamMember name="Alex van Leeuwen" /> and <TeamMember name="Jordo Dibb" /> on the content team are your main points of contact here.

Please also read [How we do video at PostHog](/handbook/growth/marketing/video). We're still figuring things out, though, so very interested in suggestions.

If your idea is for PostHog Stories (HogTok), hit up <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" /> as well.

Our approach is to provide internal Marketing-as-a-Service, aka MaaS. We are an engineering-led company, and believe in product-led, word of mouth growth. The best way marketing can contribute to PostHog's success is to act as a service to our product teams and amplify the work they are doing.

## Marketing vision 

PostHog's [vision](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/strategy#long-term-vision-for-2026) is to IPO in 2026 with $100m ARR. This is what we think marketing at PostHog will look like at that point. 

### Things we want to be brilliant at

#### Behaviours

- **Acting as a service to the engineering team:** We actively engage with engineering teams, find out what they’re working on and partner with them to amplify what they are doing. Engineers don’t like talking to marketing people in most companies. We want our engineers to want to talk to marketing because we provide them with such a great service.
 
- **Word of mouth mindset:** By IPO, we want to have built a hugely successful company driven primarily by word of mouth, rather than technical paid ads, or brand/PR.

- **Speed:** We want to be reactive, low process, and reliant on other teams as little as possible to ship things. We want to get stuff wrong quickly, then iterate. 

#### Tactics

- **Content for our ideal customer:** We deliver genuinely useful insights about things those customers care about (can be purely product-related, but also general advice). We're pitching our content at ‘self-servers’. Ahrefs and HubSpot are examples of companies who do this brilliantly for their audience.
 
- **Highly visible at industry events:** We want to be known for giving good talks at events, because this enhances word of mouth and is a natural extension of being good at creating good content.
 
- **Being really cool and interesting people in online communities:** We could do a lot more of this in relevant communities in Slack/Discord/StackOverflow etc, and it's more engaging than one-way social media. We also increase awareness in relevant communities by sponsoring them. Overall we want to be a net contributor to those communities.

### Things we want to be good at (and could outsource or delegate)

- **Paid ads:** An agency should keep handling this for us, but we shouldn’t get better at it internally. This includes out of home, should we ever decide to do this.
 
- **Incentivised campaigns** - e.g. GitHub star campaign. It's not clear how these can be repeatable sources of successful word of mouth growth for us, but they will occasional be useful.
  
-  **Developer influencers (maybe):** A small but growing trend in the industry, we could be one of the first to capitalize on this, especially as they are relevant to word of mouth.

- **Social media:** This is different from 'being cool and interesting people in online communities'. We don't get high quality traction on places like LinkedIn/Twitter, and we're not spending any time at all on Facebook/Instagram/TikTok, but it's worth maintaining a baseline presence for credibility.

### Things we don't want to spend time on

- **Big, highly coordinated marketing campaigns:** We can do them, but our reactive, short turnaround campaigns have been far more successful. 

- **PR:** If we do word of mouth well, our community will be far more valuable/credible than an appearance in TechCrunch. 

## How marketing works

These are our main values:

- Be opinionated
- Pull, don’t push
- No sneaky shit

### Be opinionated

PostHog was created because we believed that product analytics was broken and we had a vision of how it could be much better. 
 
We need to reflect this vision in our marketing, and not dilute it with boring corporate-speak. When we write content, we take a firm stance on what we believe is right. We would rather have 50% of people love us and 50% hate us, than 80% mildly agree with us. 
 
We communicate clearly, directly, and honestly.
 
It's ok to have a sense of humor. We are more likely to die because we are forgettable, not because we made a lame joke once. We have a very distinctive and weird company culture, and we should share that with customers instead of putting on a fake corporate persona when we talk to them.
 
(Sometimes we use terminology like 'value propositions' because that is the standard marketing term for a well-understood concept. That's allowed.)

### Pull, don't push

_We focus on word of mouth by default._ We believe customers will judge us first and foremost on our product (ie. our app, our website, and our docs). We won’t set ourselves up for long-term success if we push customers into using us. 
 
If a customer doesn't choose PostHog, that means either:
 
a) The product isn't good enough
b) The product isn't the right solution for them
c) We didn't communicate the benefits of the product well enough
 
We don't believe companies will be long term customers of a competitor because they did a better job of spamming them with generic content. We know this because we frequently have customers switching from a competitor to us - they are not afraid to do this.
 
Addressing a) is the responsibility of everyone at PostHog. The marketing team's specific job is to avoid spending time advertising to people in group b), and making sure we do a great job avoiding c). This means:
 
- Making sure our comms are extremely high quality
- Sharing our messages in the right places, where relevant customers can see them
- Spending enough time and/or money in those places so that our messages get through

### No sneaky shit

Our focus customers are technical and acutely aware of the tedious clickbaity marketing tactics that software companies use to try and entice them. Stop. It's patronizing to both the customer and the marketing people creating the content. 
 
We will never try to trick someone into using PostHog through spammy marketing tactics. That's a great way to boost vanity signup metrics in the short term before the customer quickly churns out.
 
For these reasons, we:
 
- Don't use any analytics except our own. No Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel etc. Customer trust is more important than making our marketing team's lives easier.

- Don't make claims about our product that are not 100% genuine and verifiable. And we don't make promises for future functionality either. People can see our entire codebase, after all!

- Don't do cold email marketing to acquire new customers. When was the last time you read the 8th email a company sent you and thought 'ok yes, I now want to use this product'?

- Don't unfairly criticize or make false claims about our competitors. We will however compare ourselves to them to help customers make a decision, and occasionally they will be a better solution for what a customer needs. That's ok.
 
- Don't bombard customers with 'deals', pop-ups and other dark patterns. If you don't like them, why do you think our customers will feel differently?
 
- Don't pretend our customers are different from us - more gullible, more susceptible to marketing. We are an engineering-led team building products for other engineers. 

## Marketing channels and tactics today

The Marketing team's main focus is acquisition of [high quality signups](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/strategy#what-should-we-be-working-on-today). We have established that _word of mouth_ is the most effective way to do this - virtually all of our high quality signups have come organically. Here are the channels we use, in _rough_ order of priority:
 
#### [Content](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog)

- **SEO content** is high value and genuinely useful content that targets the keywords we think are most relevant to our customers. We do 'clean' SEO, ie. no buying backlinks or writing clickbait. 'No clickbait' doesn't mean content has to be boring, though! Our aim is to increase our organic reach on Google, basically. We put monthly paid ads spend behind this type of content on LinkedIn or Twitter to increase awareness.
 
- **Shareable content** is stuff we think users and audiences outside PostHog will just find interesting. These may be technical deep dives or articles that give an insight into how PostHog works. We don't expect these to turn directly into signups, but they help us to build our unique and distinctive brand in the open source community. We share this content on 'super node' sites like Hacker News, Product Hunt and Reddit.
 
- **Email content:** We send out [HogMail](/handbook/growth/marketing/newsletter) every 2 weeks. The format is evolving, but it's a combination of PostHog News, tutorials and generally interesting content we've seen online that we think our users will like.
 
#### [Sponsorship](/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship)

We do this in two ways:

- **Commercial sponsorship:** Sponsoring newsletters, podcasts and events that are likely to reach our target audience. We try to keep a relatively narrow focus here.
 
- **Open source sponsorship:** Sponsoring open source projects and developers that have helped us build PostHog. Sometimes we do cross-promotion with them, but it's not necessary – this is more about giving back to the community.
 
#### [Product launches](/handbook/growth/marketing/product-announcements) 

These bring transparency to the work we do. Product and engineering pull marketing here, not the other way around. Marketing's role is to look for cool things the team is already working on and to amplify them, often through a coordinated campaign that maximizes impact. Marketing's role is definitely _not_ to get teams to build features we think are 'marketable'. We define product broadly here – it can be anything from a major PostHog app feature to a cool internal tool that we think the world should see.
 
#### [Paid ads](/handbook/growth/marketing/paid)

We advertise on Google Search for _conversion_, and Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Quora for _awareness_. We use paid ads as a cheat code to accelerate learning, e.g. which SEO keywords work, testing out product positioning, as well as to ensure we are easily discoverable when people search for PostHog specifically ('branded keywords'). However, paids ads are expensive so our focus is always on organic growth first unless we find a paid channel that's wildly profitable. Generally, we split our spend 2/3 awareness vs. 1/3 conversion.
 
#### [Press](/handbook/growth/marketing/press)

While we don't actively do PR, we occasionally put out press releases ourselves for funding announcements. 

### Marketing quarterly goals

The latest goals for marketing can be found on the [Marketing Small Team page](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/marketing#q3-2022-goals). 

### 2022 marketing calendar

We track marketing campaign activity on this (internally public only) [marketing calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit#gid=1857648072). 

## Target customer and messaging

We have articulated a series of [value propositions](/handbook/growth/marketing/value-propositions) ('value props'). These communicate PostHog's benefits in a clear and specific way to our target user, and help us ensure that we are communicating consistently across all of our different channels.

See our [customer personas page](/handbook/growth/marketing/customer-personas) for more information about what is important to our target users and how we ensuring they have the best possible experience with PostHog across all product and marketing touchpoints.

## Competitors

We closely follow other companies which are active in the product analytics space. Sometimes we summarise our findings into internal reports to help us stay informed and understand how other products are developing. Our collection of summaries isn't exhaustive and cannot be shared publicly as it often includes details of the experiences of individual user experiences whose privacy we don't want to sacrifice. However, PostHog team members can find our competitor summaries in [the relevant folder of the Marketing shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RdzCKhGjJ3f7RbzvBkVjKfPXZ0lbBefY?usp=sharing). 

## Who we are

The Marketing Small Team page is maintained [here](/handbook/people/team-structure/marketing). By 2026, we still want to be a very small but highly effective and responsive team (15-20 people), rather than a very large marketing team with all the traditional functions and hierarchy. In addition to people who share PostHog's culture, we also value:

- Strong opinions 
- People who like to choose their own objectives 
- T-shaped people (wide breadth with a spike), rather than specialists
- Hands-on people not motivated by managing a team
- We're agnostic as to experience

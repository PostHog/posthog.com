## Where does marketing fit at PostHog?

At the most fundamental level, we want to:

1. Get developers and technical product managers to use PostHog - _features_
2. Get those developers and technical product managers to be able to sell PostHog internally - _benefits_

Broadly speaking, the role of the _Marketing_ and _Website & Docs_ teams is to do 1. The role of the _Customer Success_ and _Growth_ teams is to do 2. 

(This is a slightly simplified view due to natural overlaps, so consider this a rough approximation.)

## We take a principled approach to marketing

Marketing at PostHog is about bringing transparency to what we're working on. Three principles guide us here:

- Be opinionated
- Pull, don’t push
- No sneaky shit

### Be opinionated

PostHog was created because we believed that product analytics was broken and we had a vision of how it could be much better. 
 
We need to reflect this vision in our marketing, and not dilute it with boring corporate-speak. When we write content, we take a firm stance on what we believe is right. We would rather have 50% of people love us and 50% hate us, than 80% mildly agree with us. 
 
We communicate clearly, directly, and honestly.
 
It's ok to have a sense of humor. We are more likely to die because we are forgettable, not because we made a lame joke once. We have a very distinctive and weird company culture, and we should share that with customers instead of putting on a fake corporate persona when we talk to them.
 
(Sometimes we use terminology like 'value propositions' because that is the standard marketing term for a well-understood concept. That's allowed.)

### Pull, don't push

_We focus on word of mouth by default._ We believe customers will judge us first and foremost on our product (ie. our app, our website, and our docs). We won’t set ourselves up for long-term success if we push customers into using us. 
 
If a customer doesn't choose PostHog, that means either:
 
a) The product isn't good enough
b) The product isn't the right solution for them
c) We didn't communicate the benefits of the product well enough
 
We don't believe companies will be long term customers of a competitor because they did a better job of spamming them with generic content. We know this because we frequently have customers switching from a competitor to us - they are not afraid to do this.
 
Addressing a) is the responsibility of everyone at PostHog. The marketing team's specific job is to avoid spending time advertising to people in group b), and making sure we do a great job avoiding c). This means:
 
- Making sure our comms are extremely high quality
- Sharing our messages in the right places, where relevant customers can see them
- Spending enough time and/or money in those places so that our messages get through

### No sneaky shit

Our focus customers are technical and acutely aware of the tedious clickbaity marketing tactics that software companies use to try and entice them. Stop. It's patronizing to both the customer and the marketing people creating the content. 
 
We will never try to trick someone into using PostHog through spammy marketing tactics. That's a great way to boost vanity signup metrics in the short term before the customer quickly churns out.
 
For these reasons, we:
 
- Don't use any analytics except our own. No Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel etc. Customer trust is more important than making our marketing team's lives easier.
- Don't make claims about our product that are not 100% genuine and verifiable. And we don't make promises for future functionality either. People can see our entire codebase, after all!
- Don't do cold email marketing to acquire new customers. When was the last time you read the 8th email a company sent you and thought 'ok yes, I now want to use this product'?
- Don't unfairly criticize or make false claims about our competitors. We will however compare ourselves to them to help customers make a decision, and occasionally they will be a better solution for what a customer needs. That's ok. 
- Don't bombard customers with 'deals', pop-ups and other dark patterns. If you don't like them, why do you think our customers will feel differently? 
- Don't pretend our customers are different from us - more gullible, more susceptible to marketing. We are an engineering-led team building products for other engineers. 

## So how do these values become an actual strategy?

We start by assuming that there are no shortcuts, quick wins or secrets to a successful long-term marketing strategy. It's vanishingly unlikely that a small startup is suddenly going to crack the code of marketing in some revolutionary way.
 
The marketing playbook already exists - much bigger and more successful companies than us have already written it. We're just going to execute the playbook really really well, using our unfair advantages:
 
- _We are open source_ - most companies in our space are closed source, both in product and marketing. We are up front and direct about what we do and why we do it, and we believe this will build much greater trust and a more engaged community in the long term. This manifesto is just one example of our commitment to transparency. 
- _Everybody codes_ - we know how to write high-quality content for our audience that they’ll actually want to read, and we know the keywords they are using to search for solutions like PostHog. Our more established competitors are ahead of us today, but we know we can overtake them with better content and by targeting low-competition keywords that we’ve identified.
- _Bias for action_ - we use our team’s extreme autonomy to ship things fast without going through layers of approvals. If we need a week to sign off a social media post, we will probably die. Our paid ads agency doesn’t wait for our approval either if we haven’t responded in 24 hours. 
 
Doesn't sound very exciting on the surface, does it? ('Where are my billboards and flash mobs? Why don't we open a zoo exclusively for hedgehogs? Can we go all in on the metaverse??') 
 
But we think that the opportunity to build a strong brand off the back of these values is genuinely valuable and worthwhile, and leads to far more delightful moments for us and our customers than scrabbling around for magic one-click solutions that invariably don't work. 

## What do we actually do then?

The Marketing team's main focus is acquisition of [high quality signups](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/strategy#what-should-we-be-working-on-today). We have established that _word of mouth_ is the most effective way to do this - virtually all of our high quality signups have come organically. 

We have identified the following acquisition channels as most important to our strategy. 
 
- [Content](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog). We write two types of content - SEO and shareable.
  - _SEO content_ is high value and genuinely useful content that targets the keywords we think are most relevant to our customers. We do 'clean' SEO, ie. no buying backlinks or writing clickbait. 'No clickbait' doesn't mean content has to be boring though! Our aim is to increase our organic reach on Google, basically. We put monthly paid ads spend behind this type of content on LinkedIn or Twitter to increase awareness. 
  - _Shareable content_ is stuff we think users and audiences outside PostHog will just find interesting. These may be technical deep dives or articles that give an insight into how PostHog works. We don't expect these to turn directly into signups, but they help us to build our unique and distinctive brand in the open source community. We share this content on 'super node' sites like Hacker News, Product Hunt and Reddit. 
- [Sponsorship](/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship). We do this in two ways. 
  - _Commercial sponsorship_ - Sponsoring newsletters, podcasts and events that are likely to reach our target audience. We try to keep a relatively narrow focus here. 
  - _Open source sponsorship_ - Sponsoring open source projects and developers that have helped us build PostHog. Sometimes we do cross-promotion with them, but it's not necessary - this is more about giving back to the community. 
- [Product launches](/handbook/growth/marketing/product-announcements). These bring transparency to the work we do. Product and engineering pull marketing here, not the other way around. Marketing's role is to look for cool things the team is already working on and to amplify them, often through a coordinated campaign that maximizes impact. Marketing's role is definitely _not_ to get teams to build features we think are 'marketable'. We define product broadly here - it can be anything from a major PostHog app feature to a cool internal tool that  we think the world should see. 
  - We're currently experimenting with different types and size of launch to see what works most effectively here. 
- [Paid ads](/handbook/growth/marketing/paid). We advertise on Google Search for _conversion_, and Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit and Carbon for _awareness_. We use paid ads as a cheat code to accelerate learning, e.g. which SEO keywords work, testing out product positioning, as well as to ensure we are easily discoverable when people search for PostHog specifically ('branded keywords'). However, paids ads are expensive so our focus is always on organic growth first unless we find a paid channel that's wildly profitable. Generally, we split our spend 2/3 awareness vs. 1/3 conversion. 

Other channels:

- We also send out an [email newsletter](/handbook/growth/marketing/newsletter) every 2 weeks. This is for existing users who opt-in, and usually contains one tutorial and one recent blog post, plus a couple of other fun sections. The newsletter is quite new, so the format is likely to evolve. We do not use email to try and convince new customers to use PostHog, but we want the newsletter content to be valuable enough to users to share within their organizations or externally. 
- We haven't yet figured out how we want to do [PR](/handbook/growth/marketing/press), if at all. 
- [Developer relations and community](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/developer-relations) is also super important to us, but covered elsewhere as we consider it its own discipline at PostHog. Same for [Growth](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/strategy). 

## Marketing calendar

We track marketing campaign activity on this (internally public only) [marketing calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit#gid=1857648072). 

## Who is our target customer and what do we want to say to them?

We have articulated a series of [value propositions](/handbook/growth/marketing/value-propositions) ('value props'). These communicate PostHog's benefits in a clear and specific way to our target user, and help us ensure that we are communicating consistently across all of our different channels.

See our [customer personas page](/handbook/growth/marketing/customer-personas) for more information about what is important to our target users and how we ensuring they have the best possible experience with PostHog across all product and marketing touchpoints.

Depending on the significance of the change to our product, may do an [announcement](/handbook/growth/marketing/product-announcements).

## Who are our competitors and where can I find out about them? 

We closely follow other companies which are active in the product analytics space. Sometimes we summarise our findings into internal reports to help us stay informed and understand how other products are developing. Our collection of summaries isn't exhaustive and cannot be shared publicly as it often includes details of the experiences of individual user experiences whose privacy we don't want to sacrifice. However, PostHog team members can find our competitor summaries in [the relevant folder of the Marketing shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RdzCKhGjJ3f7RbzvBkVjKfPXZ0lbBefY?usp=sharing).

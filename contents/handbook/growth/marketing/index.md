## Strategy

In 2021 we're focussing our marketing efforts on "startup" engineering teams and enthusiasts, stages 1-2 of our [Growth Strategy](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/strategy) and columns 1-2 of our company [Strategy Prioritization](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/prioritization#how-is-our-product-market-fit), supplemented with Enterprise (stage 3) campaigns and experiments that synergise with learnings from our early enterprise customers. This does not mean that you won't get more "startup-like" engineering teams at larger companies. We've already validated that there are engineering teams at scale-ups and enterprises that seek the best technology to iterate quicker. Our early enterprise customers will enable us to connect with more traditional enterprise engineering teams through accurate product messaging, case studies and more.

### For Engineers

Unlike many analytics solutions, that target product managers and other non-engineering roles, we're building PostHog for engineers and we'll support them with content- and community-driven campaigns that empower them to build successful products.

Some themes we've been discussing internally:

- Product analytics and validation for engineers
- Marketing and sales for engineers
- Getting your first customers
- How to start an open source startup

### Mass adoption at YC startups

YC is not only one of the most successful and challenging startup accelerators, it's also a strongly supportive network who want to help each other build successful products. Members show their support with advice and generous deals for their respective products - [our deal]() has helped over 50 startups, many who've gone on to be paying customers.

With our marketing team expanding, we're upping the stakes and setting a goal of getting 90%+ of startups in new YC batches and 75% of startups from the last 2 years that have not chosen a product analytics solution, to use PostHog.

We're betting on YC startups because YC acts as strict screening process for successful startups and founders. By supporting these startups, we're aligning ourselves with many future successful companies and expanding our reach and awareness to their rapidly growing network and even further within the wider YC and Hacker News network. We're betting that this will be significantly more effective than any other traditional content or paid strategies.

To incentivise YC startups to choose PostHog for the product analytics, we'll offer:

- Generously increased usage on PostHog Cloud
- Extended free premium licenses for on-premise
- Free VPC setup
- Free support hours
- Free onboarding, training and advice calls to get your demo day ready
- Additional free licenses, hardware etc to be determined
- Access to our growing library of tutorials and other resources in our docs

### The best developer community

We want to build the most active and supportive developer community around, by supporting and celebrating our community's contributions more than any other community.

We'll create resources to make it easier to contribute to different areas of PostHog, whatever your level of experience.

We'll create tools and apps that celebrate our community's growth and members' contributions.

We'll thank substantial contributions with swag and other sponsorships.

We'll financially support community lead events.

We'll make it easy to contribute to in-the-monent and long-running discussions using open tools.

### Enterprise early adopters

We'll forge deep relationships with our early enterprise customers who will be critical to develop our early enterprise product marketing and reaching more traditional enterprise engineering teams.

We're interested to learn about their processes, their awareness and adoption of product analytics solutions, enterprise specific solutions, pricing and technical and compliance requirements.

Initial user interviews will be informal, but as we start to identify key themes, will become more structured - making it easier for us to track improvements in our marketing. For example, early discussion may identify that non-technical teams choose product analytics solutions more often than technical teams.


## Metrics

### Acquisition

Marketing wholly defines the Acquisition/Awareness metrics, and indirectly invested in the remaining categories of AARRR.

In 2021 we'll build our comprehensive metrics suite, and identify the things that have the most impact throughout the funnel and not just at obvious conversion event.

### Activation, Retention and Referral

While these metrics, and the ability to impact them, are mostly defined by Product and Engineering, Marketing is interested in their continued improvement and the ability to implement referral mechanisms within the product.

### Revenue

Revenue metrics fall under Sales, but Marketing is interested in the types of leads that result in conversions in order for us to adjust our focus.


## Marketing Functions

We're in the process of building a cross-functional marketing team to initially convert technical teams and individuals developers at startups, thereafter expanding to other business functions and scale-ups and enterprises.

Our marketing functions will include product marketing, content marketing, community, paid and operations but as a team we work closely with the product team, engineering and specifically growth engineering to improve AARRR, support and sales.

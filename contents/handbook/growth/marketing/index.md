The Marketing team's main focus is acquisition. Our specific objective is to _get as many relevant developers and technical product managers as possible to visit posthog.com_ 

Once a visitor lands on our website, the [Growth](/handbook/people/team-structure/growth) team are responsible for maximizing activation. 

## Positioning

We use a positioning statement to help us think about how we can continue to improve and evolve PostHog ahead of alternative tools:

_For product managers who need to understand their users, PostHog is the only open-source, all-in-one analytics platform that offers everything from funnel analysis and cohort tracking, to feature flags and session recording._ 

_Unlike traditional tools, PostHog offers self-hosted deployments so that data doesn't need to be shared with anyone -- not even PostHog._ 

See [our messaging framework for more information](/handbook/growth/marketing/messaging_framework) about positioning and how we bring it to life. 

### Value propositions

We have used our messaging framework to then articulate a series of [value propositions](/handbook/growth/marketing/value-propositions) ('value props'). These communicate PostHog's benefits in a clear and specific way to our target user, and help us ensure that we are communicating consistently across all of our different channels. This is particular important for paid ads. 

### Target user

We have built out two user personas and will continue to flesh these out and add more as we gather more information:

- Sam Software, a senior software engineer
- Pam Product, a senior product manager

See our [customer personas page](/handbook/growth/marketing/customer-personas) for more information about what is important to these users and how we ensuring they have the best possible experience with PostHog across all product and marketing touchpoints. 

### Products

An **open source product analytics platform**, PostHog addresses the lack of choice and control amongst disconnected analytics solutions by offering a **unified platform** with **control** over hosting, pricing, source, data, privacy and security.

- **PostHog Open Source** is positioned to service 1-3 users in teams of any size, from hobbyists to enterprise deployments.
- **PostHog Scale** is positioned to service collaborative teams or enterprises who need to retain control of their data. 
- **PostHog Enterprise** is positioned to service large enterprises who have more complex or involved infra and config needs. 
- **PostHog Cloud** is positioned to service collaborative teams or enterprises who value simplicity or don't need to retain control of their data.

Depending on the significance of the change to our product, may do an [announcement](/handbook/growth/marketing/product-announcements).

## Acquisition channels

We have identified a number of channels that we are prioritising based on our target users. Some of these are not owned by Marketing, but are closely linked.

The Marketing team's objective is to _increase the number of relevant visitors to posthog.com._ Once a visitor lands on our website, the Growth team are then responsible for maximising conversion and activation. 

As we aspire to product-led growth, we believe that it is important to treat our Website & Docs as their own product as well, rather than having them be owned by Marketing. 

## Positioning

We use a positioning statement based on [a template by Geoffrey Moore](https://gist.github.com/JoshSmith/2041454), which enables us to establish a position relative to the rest of the market. Our positioning statement helps us think about how we can continue to improve and evolve PostHog ahead of alternative tools:

_For product managers who need to understand their users, PostHog is the only open-source, all-in-one analytics platform that offers everything from funnel analysis and cohort tracking, to feature flags and session recording._ 

_Unlike traditional tools, PostHog offers self-hosted deployments so that data doesn't need to be shared with anyone -- not even PostHog._ 

See [our messaging framework for more information](/handbook/growth/marketing/messaging_framework) about positioning and how we bring it to life. 

## Value propositions

We have used our messaging framework to then articulate a series of [value propositions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VVLqk8xiKPj_rzDDhVA2eMFx7ENlhg9WnYDj2rkd_E4/edit?usp=sharing) ('value props'). These communicate PostHog's benefits in a clear and specific way to our target user, and help us ensure that we are communicating consistently across all of our different channels. This is particular important for paid ads. 

## Products

An **open source product analytics platform**, PostHog addresses the lack of choice and control amongst disconnected analytics solutions by offering a **unified platform** with **control** over hosting, pricing, source, data, privacy and security.

**PostHog Open Source** is positioned to service 1-3 users in teams of any size, from hobbyists to enterprise deployments.

**PostHog Scale** is positioned to service collaborative teams or enterprises who need to retain control of their data. 

**PostHog Cloud** is positioned to service collaborative teams or enterprises who value simplicity or don't need to retain control of their data.

## Target audience

*Innovative technical teams* building growth products, who care about:

- a unified product analytics platform
- open source
- control: hosting, pricing, source, data, privacy and security

We are in the process of building more specific user personas. 

## Acquisition channels

We have identified a number of acquisition channels that we are prioritising based on our target user. These are split into scalable and non-scalable channels. Some of these are not owned by Marketing, but are closely linked:

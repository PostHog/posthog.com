**The Marketing/Acquisition Team**

Philosophy: Be kind, concise and direct.

## Positioning statement

We use a positioning statement based on a template by Geoffrey Moore, which enables us to establish a position relative to the rest of the market. Our positioning statement helps us think about how we can continue to improve and evolve PostHog ahead of alternative tools.

Our positioning statement is:

_For product managers who need to understand their users, PostHog is the only open-source, all-in-one analytics platform that offers everything from funnel analysis and cohort tracking, to feature flags and session recording._ 

_Unlike traditional tools, PostHog offers self-hosted deployments so that data doesn't need to be shared with anyone -- not even PostHog._ 

See [our messaging framework for more information](./marketing/messaging_framework.md) about positioning and how we bring it to life. 

## Products

An **open source product analytics platform**, PostHog addresses the lack of choice and control amongst disconnected analytics solutions by offering a **unified platform** with **control** over hosting, pricing, source, data, privacy and security.

**PostHog Open Source** is positioned to service 1-3 users in teams of any size, from hobbyists to enterprise deployments.

**PostHog Scale** is positioned to service collaborative teams or enterprises who need to retain control of their data. 

**PostHog Cloud** is positioned to service collaborative teams or enterprises who value simplicity or don't need to retain control of their data.

## Target audience

*Innovative technical teams*, more commonly found in startups, who care about:

- a unified product analytics platform

We will expand to non-technical teams when we have achieved technical awareness saturation.

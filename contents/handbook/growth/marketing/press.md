## Press enquiries

Direct all press enquiries to press@posthog.com

Only James, Tim, Charles or Sean should talk to the press on PostHog's behalf.

## Press releases

For significant milestones (funding, features, hires) we'll collaborate with press to release the news.

Depending on the news and outlets we are working with, we would need 3-6 weeks from concept to publication.

### Planning

We should cover **one big thing** and optionally **one to two smaller** topics which feed off of it.

Be upfront and clear about:

1. the target developer audience
2. quantifiable goals
3. approximate release date

Be specific about which developers we are targeting based on their needs/problems we're addressing. Make goals numerical, percentage increase or decrease, versus purely qualitative.

**Example:**

- News: Plugins coming out of beta
- Audience: developers looking for an easy to customize analytics platform
- Goal: Increase acquizition by 20% the week of the announcement
- Goal: Increase plugin creation awareness (developers who start creating a plugin) by 10% the week of the announcement (usage or completion is out of scope of marketing).
- Date: 6 weeks from now

**Bad goals:**

- Share PostHog's Plugins with more people
- Increase the excitement for PostHog Plugins

### Press feelers

When putting out press feelers, we will get more positive responses the more complete our news is. In the best case scenario we present a nearly complete announcement, but at least, write a brief and get feedback from James, Tim and Sean.

Use our press release spreadsheet to reach out to known and new press contacts with the news, and offer exclusives to larger outlets.

Only progress on content creation when we have confirmed an exclusive or have interest from a handful of non-exclusives.

### Two weeks before

Confirm details with press:
- Share final dates with outlets
- Confirm exclusives
- Gather more interest with a nearly complete campaign
- Secure final approval on 3rd party content: brands, media, quotes, etc.

### One week before

Share complete campaign:
- Share press pack with outlets
- Arrange calls and interviews

### Release

- Make sure our release announcement is public but hidden in case outlets release slightly early or we are slow to publish (Git-based).
- Push out the press release via BusinessWire
- Once the press have shared the news, add the post to the homepage and blog index

### One hour after

Wait an hour after the release before promoting on our channels to give press outlets an opportunity to share.

- Make a submission to YC's social media request form
- Share in YC Slack
- Share in PostHog User Slack (community)
- Share on LinkedIn, on PostHog's or James' account
- Share on Twitter
- Share the social links in PostHog #general for the team to boost

### One day after

Wait a day after the release before promoting on communities to give our community members an opportunity to share.

Share to the following communities if relevant and the news hasn't already been shared there:

- Startup School
- Hacker News
- Indie Hackers
- Reddit:

## Press release content

Create content that is likely to achieve the campaigns goals.

Include quotes from James, Tim or influential people linked to PostHog - investors, customers, personalties.

So many press releases are boring and read like an enterprise presentation. Make it more accessible and exciting without marketing buzz. Try and tell people why the news is a big deal, what serious problems we solve, how much easier something is etc.

As we test different press release formats we will develop a press release template. For now, include the following information on PostHog and our investors:

```
## About PostHog

PostHog is an open source, product analytics platform. PostHog enables software teams to understand user behavior – auto-capturing events, performing product analytics and dashboarding, enabling video replays, and rolling out new features behind feature flags, all based on their single open source platform. The product’s open source approach enables companies to self-host, removing the need to send data externally.

Founded in 2020 by James Hawkins and Tim Glaser, PostHog was a member of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and has subsequent raised $12m in funding from GV, Y Combinator and notable angel investors including Jason Warner (CTO, GitHub), Solomon Hykes (Founder, Docker) and David Cramer (Founder, Sentry).

## About Y Combinator Continuity Fund

YC Continuity is an investment fund dedicated to supporting founders as they scale their companies. Our primary goal is to support YC alumni companies by investing in their subsequent funding rounds, though we occasionally invest in non-YC companies as well.

Like YC’s early-stage partners, the entire YC Continuity team has strong operating experience. We work to create opportunities for founders to continue their personal growth and scale their companies successfully.

We also run the YC Growth Program, which brings together founder-CEOs who are leading rapidly growing companies.

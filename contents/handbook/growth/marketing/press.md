## About PostHog

PostHog is an open source, product analytics platform. PostHog enables software teams to understand user behavior – auto-capturing events, performing product analytics and dashboarding, enabling video replays, and rolling out new features behind feature flags, all based on their single open source platform. The product’s open source approach enables companies to self-host, removing the need to send data externally.

Founded in 2020 by James Hawkins and Tim Glaser, PostHog was a member of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and has subsequent raised $12m in funding from GV, Y Combinator and notable angel investors including Jason Warner (CTO, GitHub), Solomon Hykes (Founder, Docker) and David Cramer (Founder, Sentry).

## About Y Combinator Continuity Fund

YC Continuity is an investment fund dedicated to supporting founders as they scale their companies. Our primary goal is to support YC alumni companies by investing in their subsequent funding rounds, though we occasionally invest in non-YC companies as well.

Like YC’s early-stage partners, the entire YC Continuity team has strong operating experience. We work to create opportunities for founders to continue their personal growth and scale their companies successfully.

We also run the YC Growth Program, which brings together founder-CEOs who are leading rapidly growing companies.

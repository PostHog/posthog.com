[PostHog for Startups](https://posthog.com/startups) is our program to support early stage companies. We offer generous credits together with a bunch of extra goodies. This page covers how we run the program.

> The YC Deal is a separate deal that we do for the latest batch of YC companies and has [its own page here](/handbook/growth/sales/yc-onboarding). 

Any company that is <2 years old and has raised $5m in funding or less is eligible. 

## What happens after companies apply

1. Company applies by signing up to PostHog and then emailing us at startups@.
2. CS verify they meet the criteria and apply a $50k Stripe _coupon_ to their account that expires in 12 months.
3. Charles replies and sends a link to the [PostHog for Startups Giveaway](https://app.printfection.com/account/campaign/overview.php?storeid=309416) from Printfection. Hit 'Get new link', copy the link and then mark it as 'sent'. The user redeems the link and enters their own shipping details.
4. Charles adds them to the `PostHog for Startups` Google Sheet in the Marketing shared Google drive for future event invites.
5. Once a month, we schedule office hours with James/Luke (business & product) and Charles/Simon (ops & commercial) - Charles will send out an email to gauge interest then we can just send a Zoom invite if enough people are interested. If too many people start showing up, we can do this differently at a later date. 
6. Once a month, Charles will go through the list of startups who have signed up and pick one to spotlight. He'll interview them following a standard format and post it to our blog. 
7. If a startup lets us know they have a launch coming up, we'll support them ad hoc on Twitter, Slack etc. 

> The PostHog for Startups deal is also posted on our profile at [F6S here](https://www.f6s.com/company-deals/posthog/50k-in-credits-extras-13984). They still follow the same process as above. 

### Monthly office hours

We host private monthly office hours with one of Luke (product), James (product, company building), Charles (ops, marketing), or Simon (sales, CS). Charles organizes these and sends out an email to the mailing list - template below. 

Create the calendar event with a Meet link in advance and then just manually add people to it if they reply to the email. **Obviously you should BCC everyone.** We'll probably automate this more in the future. Use Meet so you don't have any issues with hosts not attending. 

Product example:
```

### Startup of the month

Each month, we'll pick a startup to highlight. Charles will interview them and then write up the responses as a blog post which we'll also publish on Twitter, LinkedIn and user Slack.

The questions follow a standard format:

```
What is your product, and why is it cool?
Why did you decide this was a problem worth solving?
Who are you building for?
What are you most excited about?
What are you most worried about?
What is something you know today that you wish you'd known at the beginning?
```

## The types of videos we make

We're still figuring this out, but the first few videos we've made have been:

1. **Small team explainers:** Have small teams explain their product. Ask what it is, their advice on getting started, underrated features, and more. Useful as both evergreen YouTube content and on `posthog.com`.

2. **Educational video essay:** James (or someone else) explains a concept or shares lessons from PostHog. Similar to what [Y Combinator](https://www.youtube.com/@ycombinator) or [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg) do. Usually based on our newsletter or blog content. Include graphics and animations if possible. 

3. **Launch videos:** To support the launch of new products, have James + product team member talk about what the new product is, its features, its use cases, and how viewers can get started. Include B-roll of product. 

4. **Changelog:** To go with the monthly changelog email, a shorter, higher tempo video detailing a bunch of new features that have shipped recently for PostHog. Include b-roll of features. 

5. **One-off:** We filmed a documentary and PostHog "pop quiz" video at the Tulum offsite. We want to "do more weird" too.

## How to work with the video team

- Know what type of video you want to make. Try to fit it into one of the above categories (and remember, we're up for doing a "one-off" film that is totally different to what we've done before) and <PrivateLink url="https://app.slack.com/client/TSS5W8YQZ/C01FHN8DNN6">tell us in the content channel</PrivateLink>.

- Suggest when it would make sense to shoot it. London is our main base, but we're flexible to travel and can potentially guide you to capture footage as part of a remote shoot. The further out you can suggest the better because there is a lot more logistical planning involved in shooting a video than writing code. We can feedback on how realistic your timelines are.

- Know your product, even if it's early. What does it do? What are the important features? What are some real world use cases? What's coming next? Why should someone pick it over a competitor? What's interesting about it? Many videos will rely on these details.

- Be ready to be on camera or have a plan for a replacement. None of us are professional actors (well, maybe some...) but it is better for us to create something real than something generic, even if it isn't perfect. We'll coach and support you through it.

## What does success look like?

1. We make a variety of high quality videos. We trust our taste for this. Brand and content are cornerstones of PostHogâ€™s marketing and video should contribute to this.

2. Videos support our marketing goals like new product launches and helping founders and developers succeed.

3. Videos get a lot of views, engagement, and drive signup growth (either directly or through word of mouth).

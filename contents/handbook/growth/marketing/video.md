## What we're doing right now

- **The Changelog:** Our goal is to produce a great changelog update every two weeks with a theme that rotates every three months. This is produced by <TeamMember name="Jordo Dibb" photo /> based on recent changelog entries. We also have plans to turn this into a quarterly wrap-up.

- **Launch videos:** We've made some already, but we're still developing how we do these. The goal is to have a creative format that's repeatable and can be shot at (reasonably) short notice. We're avoiding doing custom creatives for each launch for now, though this is something we'd like to explore at a later date. Examples include [Why we made an open-source developer toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqeD2vvAA4w&t=17s) and [Introducing Max AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Iculwh7q8).

- **Brand-centric hero videos:** We have a unique culture and brand, and we want to share that. A hackathon documentary shot at our Tulum offsite is currently in post-production, and we're developing some repeatable formats that showcase our culture. Our very first take on this was the [pop quiz video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeU5MmpqBg0).

- **Core brand assets:** There are some core things we need right now, like punchy and up-to-date demo videos for the platform and individual products. We're starting with demo videos, and we'll expand from there.

## Things we want to do

- **Pre-roll video ads:** We haven't done anything like this yet, and we have a big old paid ads budget to spend, so...

- **Way more educational content:** We've dipped into this a bit, but this will become a priority once we've scaled video further and have the resources to these consistently to a high standard.

- **Build a great YouTube channel:** This is a long term aspiration.

## How to work with the video team

- Know what type of video you want to make. Try to fit it into one of the above categories (and remember, we're up for doing a "one-off" film that is totally different to what we've done before). 
  - Got a random idea? Share in the <PrivateLink url="https://app.slack.com/client/TSS5W8YQZ/C01FHN8DNN6">content and video ideas channel</PrivateLink>. 
  - Got a specific request? Use the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues/new?template=video-request-form.yaml">video request form</PrivateLink> and be thorough.

- Suggest when it would make sense to shoot it. London is our main base, but we're flexible to travel and can potentially guide you to capture footage as part of a remote shoot. The further out you can suggest the better because there is a lot more logistical planning involved in shooting a video than writing code. We can feedback on how realistic your timelines are.

- Know your product, even if it's early. What does it do? What are the important features? What are some real world use cases? What's coming next? Why should someone pick it over a competitor? What's interesting about it? Many videos will rely on these details.

- Be ready to be on camera or have a plan for a replacement. None of us are professional actors (well, maybe some...) but it is better for us to create something real than something generic, even if it isn't perfect. We'll coach and support you through it.

## What does success look like?

1. We make a variety of high quality videos. We trust our taste for this. Brand and content are cornerstones of PostHogâ€™s marketing and video should contribute to this.

2. Videos support our marketing goals, like new product launches and helping founders and developers succeed.

3. Videos get a lot of views, engagement, and drive signup growth (either directly or through word of mouth).

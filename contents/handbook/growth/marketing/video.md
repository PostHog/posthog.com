## What we're doing right now

- **The Changelog:** Our goal is to produce a great changelog update every two weeks with a theme that rotates every three months. This is produced by <TeamMember name="Jordo Dibb" photo /> based on recent changelog entries. We also have plans to turn this into a quarterly wrap-up.

- **Launch videos:** We've made some already, but we're still developing how we do these. The goal is to have a creative format that's repeatable and can be shot at (reasonably) short notice. We're avoiding doing custom creatives for each launch for now, though this is something we'd like to explore at a later date. Our first was [Introducing Max AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Iculwh7q8).

- **Brand-centric hero videos:** We have a unique culture and brand, and we want to share that. A hackathon documentary shot at our Tulum offsite is currently in post-production, and we're developing some repeatable formats that showcase our culture. Our very first takes on this are the [pop quiz video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeU5MmpqBg0), and [Why we made an open-source developer toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqeD2vvAA4w&t).

- **Core brand assets:** There are some core things we need right now, like punchy and up-to-date demo videos for the platform and individual products. We're starting with demo videos, and we'll expand from there.

## Things we want to do

- **Pre-roll video ads:** We haven't done anything like this yet, and we have a big old paid ads budget to spend, so...

- **Way more educational content:** We've dipped into this a bit, but this will become a priority once we've scaled video further and have the resources to do these consistently to a high standard.

- **Build a great YouTube channel:** This is a long term aspiration.

## How to work with the video team

- Know what type of video you want to make. Try to fit it into one of the above categories (and remember, we're up for doing a "one-off" film that is totally different to what we've done before). 
  - Got a random idea? Share in the <PrivateLink url="https://app.slack.com/client/TSS5W8YQZ/C01FHN8DNN6">content and video ideas channel</PrivateLink>. 
  - Got a specific request? Use the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues/new?template=video-request-form.yaml">video request form</PrivateLink> and be thorough.

- Suggest when it would make sense to shoot it. London is our main base, but we're flexible to travel and can potentially guide you to capture footage as part of a remote shoot. The further out you can suggest the better because there is a lot more logistical planning involved in shooting a video than writing code. We can feedback on how realistic your timelines are.

- Know your product, even if it's early. What does it do? What are the important features? What are some real world use cases? What's coming next? Why should someone pick it over a competitor? What's interesting about it? Many videos will rely on these details.

- Be ready to be on camera or have a plan for a replacement. None of us are professional actors (well, maybe some...) but it is better for us to create something real than something generic, even if it isn't perfect. We'll coach and support you through it.

## How to record Loom walkthroughs for us

When recording internal case studies or other video assets, it’s important that all footage is captured in HD (1080p or ideally 4K). Lower-resolution recordings (like 720p) make it difficult for viewers to read on-screen text and limit what the video team can do during editing — such as cropping, zooming, or resizing.

Unfortunately, Loom’s Starter/Creator Lite roles only support 720p recording, so you’ll need to make sure you have the right setup before recording.

##¢ Step-by-step setup

1. Check your Loom role
- Log in to Loom and check your user role ([example screenshot](https://d.pr/i/AaoWCN)).
- If you’re listed as a **Creator Lite**, click **Request Role Upgrade**.
- In the request box, note that you need the **Creator** role to record HD assets for the PostHog video team.
- Upgrades can take up to a day — plan ahead.

2. Install the Loom Desktop App
- [Download the desktop app](https://d.pr/i/ndABtB).
- The **browser app and extension do not support 4K recording**.

3. Update video quality settings
- Open the Loom Desktop App.
- Click `… More → Settings → Video & audio`.
- Set **Video quality** to **4K** (or **1080p** if 4K isn’t available).
- Do **not** leave it on *Auto*.

### Recording guidelines

Loom’s has some [recording tips for a great video](https://support.loom.com/hc/en-us/articles/23267938305565-Recording-tips-for-a-great-video), but we also suggest the following:

- Introduce yourself
Start by saying your name and role at PostHog.

- Avoid recording sensitive data
Try not to show customer-sensitive information such as emails or IDs. If you do, leave **timestamped comments** in Loom noting what needs to be blurred or removed.

- Be human
Mistakes are fine — no need to restart! Just pause, regroup, and keep going. The video team will handle trimming in post-production.

- End with a clear outro
Example: “Hopefully this helps illustrate how PostHog uses Data Warehouse to track metrics. Thanks for watching!”

## What does success look like?

1. We make a variety of high quality videos. We trust our taste for this. Brand and content are cornerstones of PostHog’s marketing and video should contribute to this.

2. Videos support our marketing goals, like new product launches and helping founders and developers succeed.

3. Videos get a lot of views, engagement, and drive signup growth (either directly or through word of mouth).

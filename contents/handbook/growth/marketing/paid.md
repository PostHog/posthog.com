The objective of our paid advertising is to increase the number of [relevant developers](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/strategy#target-audience-for-2021) who are aware of PostHog. As we believe in [product-led growth](https://posthog.com/blog/product-led-growth), paid ads are _not_ at the heart of our marketing strategy. Instead, we see them as a way to complement and amplify the work we are doing in other areas of marketing and product. 

We are beginning to run a series of limited experiments to understand which combination of content, platforms and audience are likely to be most effective for us:
- We launch 2 experiments each week
- Each experiment runs for 2 weeks
- We aim to spend ~$1,000 per experiment

We have made certain hypotheses for what we think will be most effective on each platform. As there are many combinations of experiment we can run, we are focusing on a targeted list of platforms for now. 

## General tactics

These will evolve over time:
- Show, don't tell - share genuinely interesting content and let the user discover the product themselves. If you wouldn't click on the link, why do you think our users would?
- Use our very distinctive brand of graphic art as much as possible - it tells a story that draws people in better than screenshots of graphs. 
- Better to be opinionated and a bit divisive than unmemorable.
- No bullshit - double down on our open/transparent product and culture.
- _Definitely_ no unfounded technical claims or feature promises.
- Don't be afraid to use humor, coding jokes etc. 

Bear in mind a lot of our users will use ad-blocking of some kind - this is why our other channels such as [developer relations](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/marketing/developer-relations) are especially important. 

## Brand guidelines

- Always follow our [messaging framework](/handbook/growth/marketing/messaging_framework) to ensure consistency across channels.
- We have [a handy set of assets](https://www.figma.com/file/MRmFaOSXV1zYTGnOODGyCc/Social-Media?node-id=1307%3A13884) that you can use, together with guidelines for each platform. Please make sure you follow these so our brand and design language remain consistent across all our various platforms. 

## Platforms

### Twitter Ads

- Focus: Broad - a mixture of product and company-related content
- Target audience: Developers
- Types of content promoted: product, features, technical deep dives, company, culture
- Voice: opinionated, punchy, can be more sales-y

### Reddit Ads

- Focus: Narrow - product only
- Target audience: Developers (in relevant subreddits)
- Types of content: product, features, technical deep dives, links to GitHub

### LinkedIn Ads

- Focus: Narrow - company only
- Target audience: Product Managers, CTOs, co-founders
- Types of content: company, culture

We also may occasionally use LinkedIn for paid recruitment ads, but that is a separate topic not covered here.


### Google Ads

- Focus: TBD - likely broad
- Target audience: TBD but we will look to capture PostHog search keywords
- Types of content: TBD, we'll need to experiment
- Voice: TBD, we'll need to experiment


We may consider other paid platforms such as Facebook and Stack Overflow in the future as we learn more. 

If you need access to any of these platforms, ask Charles, James H or Mo.

PostHog community members can earn points by completing achievements and redeem them for stickers, merch credits, and other rewards from the Points tab on their profile.

## How points work

Points are earned by completing achievements. Each achievement has a point value based on the time and effort we expect someone to spend earning it. For example, voting on the roadmap, updating your bio, and asking your first question are each worth a few points – enough to earn a sticker.

Users can also receive points as one-off gifts from moderators for special contributions that don't fit neatly into an achievement category.

### Earning points

Points are primarily earned by completing achievements. To see available achievements and plan which to tackle next, visit the <Link to="/community/achievements" state={{ newWindow: true }}>achievements page</Link>.

Achievements are awarded for activities like:

- Contributing to [community discussions](/questions)
- Helping other community members
- Hitting milestones (e.g. first question, first answer)
- Voting on the [public roadmap](/roadmap)
- Completing your community profile

### Balance & transactions

- **Balance updates automatically** when you earn achievements or redeem rewards
- **Transaction history** shows what you've earned, why you earned it, and any redeemed merch codes
- **Progress tracking** shows how many points you need to reach the next reward

## Redeeming points

Redemptions are completely self-serve from the Points tab on your profile.

The points store offers two types of rewards:

### Products (e.g. stickers)

When you redeem a product like a sticker:

1. Click "Redeem" on the reward card
2. Confirm the redemption
3. A button appears letting you order it immediately
4. Enter your name and shipping address to complete the order

### Merch credits

When you redeem a merch credit (gift card):

1. Click "Redeem" on the reward card
2. Confirm the redemption
3. You receive a discount code
4. Click "Use in store" to open the [merch store](/merch) with your code pre-applied
5. Shop for anything you'd like!

Merch codes are saved in your transaction history, so you can always find them again if needed.

## For moderators

### Gifting points

Moderators can gift points to users for contributions that don't fit into existing achievements:

1. Navigate to the user's profile on posthog.com
2. Click the gift icon (present button) in the profile header
3. Enter the number of points and a reason for the gift
4. Click "Send gift" and confirm

### Monitoring redemptions

Redemptions are self-serve, but we have a <PrivateLink url="https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C0A361G3DGT">Slack channel</PrivateLink> set up to monitor them while we're ironing out any kinks. This gives us visibility without requiring manual approval.

### Creating achievements

See [Achievements](/handbook/community/profiles#achievements) in the community profiles documentation for instructions on creating, assigning, and revoking achievements.

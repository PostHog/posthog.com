We've all been there. Something was just merged and now there is a bug that you are having a real hard time pinning down.
You hate to do it...but you need to get on a prod box to see what's going on. _SHAME_

### Step 1

Make sure that you have `awscli` installed locally on your computer.

For macs you should [brew install](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/awscli) it:
```bash
brew install awscli
```

#### Configure aws cli
```bash
aws configure
```

From here follow the wizard and enter your aws key and secret key. You should use `us-east-1` as your region.

### Step 2

You'll need to make sure that you have the [Session Manager plugin for aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) installed.
To install the [Session Manager plugin for osx](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) using the bundled installer.

#### Download the bundled installer.

```bash
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/mac/sessionmanager-bundle.zip" -o "sessionmanager-bundle.zip"
```

#### Unzip the package.

```bash
unzip sessionmanager-bundle.zip
```

#### Run the install command.

```bash
sudo ./sessionmanager-bundle/install -i /usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin -b /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin
```

### Step 3

Go to the ECS console in AWS. Select the `posthog-production-cluster` and then select the service that you would like to exec into.
From that service select a currently running task. _IT MUST BE RUNNING AND STABLE_. If the service is flapping this will not help you.

Copy the *TASK ID*. We'll be using that later.

### Step 4

#### Exec into the container

Plug the task id into the following command and get to work slacker!
(You may also need to change the container name depending on the service you are hoping into)

```bash
aws ecs execute-command  \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --cluster posthog-production-cluster \
    --task <TASK_ID from earlier> \
    --container posthog-production \
    --command "/bin/bash" \
    --interactive
```

If all of this fails reach out to the engineer on call.

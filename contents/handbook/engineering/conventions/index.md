We maintain coding conventions to keep the codebase consistent and easy to work with. They capture patterns that have worked well and help avoid common pitfalls.

**By area:**

- [Frontend](/handbook/engineering/conventions/frontend-coding) - Kea/React patterns, TypeScript, CSS/Tailwind, scenes
- [Backend](/handbook/engineering/conventions/backend-coding) - logging, testing, ClickHouse/HogQL, licensing
- [Scripts](/handbook/engineering/conventions/scripts) - standard bin scripts across repositories

These aren't exhaustive rules - use judgment. When in doubt, look at existing code for patterns.

Questions or suggestions? The [Developer Experience team](/teams/developer-experience) coordinates this, drop a message in #team-devex.

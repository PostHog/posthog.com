import { Spin } from 'antd'

What better way to document MDX than with MDX?

## Rationale

There were a few moving parts involved with setting up MDX so it might make sense to have them written down.

## What's MDX?

Not in scope here - but it's essentially React in Markdown.

## How do we make it work?

### Plugin

The first thing we need is `gatsby-plugin-mdx`. That's configured in `gatsby-config.js`.

We also need `gatsby-source-filesystem` but we already use that for Markdown remarking.

### createPages

There is a plugin that creates MDX pages for you, but it was a bit limiting with regards to templates. Hence, we implement page creation ourselves 
in `gatsby/createPages.js`.

That does 2 GraphQL queries - one for Markdown files, and the other for MDX files.

The response is almost the same, with a few differences. 

Here, for the MDX part, we pass the page (node) `id` as part of the context for the template to process each page. More on this later.

### MDX Template

`TemplateMdx.tsx` is almost the same as our traditional post template, however, it queries MDX pages based on their ID 
which we passed via the `createPages` context.

The GraphQL query will return everything we need, from content to frontmatter, and we use the component 
`MDXRenderer` to render the body, and `MDXProvider` to pass some context that is available to all MDX pages.

In this case, we pass references to components that can then be used without imports directly on MDX pages, like this hedgehog:

<BasicHedgehogImage />

Because of the components passed to `MDXProvider`, I can include this hedgehog by just adding `<BasicHedgehogImage />` in my 
MDX file - no import needed. 

However, if I want to include something from a module, I can also do so. Here's a spinner component from AntD:

<Spin />

<br />
<br />


```js

import { Spin } from 'antd'

## Some Markdown

<Spin />

```

### mdxImportGen

The `mdxImportGen.js` script handles global MDX imports automatically. This is currently a quick implementation that can improve 
and be made more robust in the pre-commit process. Essentially, it prepares a file based on all the components in our `src/components` directory
which is then used to pass the components to `MDXProvider`, making them available everywhere. 

Doing globally available imports this way was important for 3 main reasons:

- Relative imports in MDX can be annoying
- Keeping MDX files clean
- Making MDX a nice experience even for less technical people that update our website

### CodeBlock

To create syntax-highlighted code blocks in Markdown, we use a plugin that handles it automatically.

However, this plugin does not work for MDX. As such, we establish a `CodeBlock` component passed alongside the others 
as a prop to `MDXProvider`. It operates on `pre` tags.

This component leverages the `prism-react-renderer` module, which does not have the Okaidia theme that we use on Markdown pages.

As such, we could either switch themes or port the Okaidia CSS into the acceptable format. The latter was done and 
the ported theme styles can be found in `src/lib/okaidia/index.js`.

## Final note

A final point is that a lot of this setup was done this way because we want to keep Markdown alongside MDX for now.

However, it could be worth considering migrating entirely in the future to simplify things, if MDX meets our needs entirely.

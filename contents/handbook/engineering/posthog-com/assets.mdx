title: Uploading assets
---

We use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for asset management (image and video uploads), mainly to reduce website build times (as each image hosted within the repo has to get processed on each build). Offloading assets to Cloudinary saves time and resources.

## Uploading an asset

1. Go to the [Cloudinary dashboard](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-112bd66abc0aa594ac70f206d45dc7/media_library/folders/c715b6391489025283fd69ae547ae8adb9?view_mode=list) and log in. (Find the login in 1Password.)
    
    _Pro tip: Double-click a folder to drill in, despite the cursor pointer indicating it's a link you only need to click once._
1. Drag and drop to upload
1. Add the filename (and any folders) to the base asset URL:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/
   ```
1. Use the full URL in your docs or handbook update

## Improving this workflow

There are some ways to reduce the effort to upload a new asset:

1. **Add Cloudinary as a desktop-like app on your computer.**

    Rather than visiting the Cloudinary website in your browser, download [WebCatalog](https://webcatalog.io/en/apps/cloudinary/). It allows you to add a Cloudinary icon to your dock, providing one-click access to the media upload page. Drag and drop to upload from there.
1. **Use a text expander to save the URL of the base asset path** (e.g. `https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/`) so you don't have to type it out each time. You can then use a customizable keyboard shortcut like `cloudurl` to paste the base URL, then you only need to add your filename to the end of the path.

  Here are some text expander options (for Mac):

    - [espanso](https://espanso.org/) - powerful but nerdy, free
    - [aText](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/) - one time license fee option
    - [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) - subscription fee

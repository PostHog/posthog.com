We use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for asset management (image and video uploads), mainly to reduce website build times (as each image hosted within the repo has to get processed on each build). Offloading assets to Cloudinary saves time and resources.

## Uploading assets via the PostHog.com uploader (recommended)

1. Sign into your PostHog.com account (via [Questions](/questions))
1. Click the account menu, then choose 'Upload media'
  <ProductScreenshot imageLight={ImgMediaUpload}  alt="" classes="rounded" />
1. Select (or drag) media to upload

  This supports images, gifs, and videos - though you'll want to be sure videos are optimized before uploading
  <ProductScreenshot imageLight={ImgMediaUploadDialog}  alt="" classes="rounded" />
1. Copy the file URL and insert wherever you need it

## Uploading assets using the Cloudinary website

1. Go to the [Cloudinary dashboard](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-112bd66abc0aa594ac70f206d45dc7/media_library/folders/c715b6391489025283fd69ae547ae8adb9?view_mode=list) and log in. (Find the login in 1Password.)
    
    _Pro tip: Double-click a folder to drill in, despite the cursor pointer indicating it's a link you only need to click once._
1. Click 'Upload' in the top right, then drag and drop. **The upload button will not appear unless you follow the exact link above into the image folder.**
1. Add the filename (and any folders) to the base asset URL:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/
   ```
1. Use the full URL in your docs or handbook update

title: Uploading assets with Cloudinary
---

We use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for asset management (image and video uploads), mainly to reduce website build times (as each image hosted within the repo has to get processed on each build). Offloading assets to Cloudinary saves time and resources.

## Uploading assets via the PostHog.com uploader (recommended)

1. Sign into your PostHog.com account via profile icon in top right corner
2. Click the account menu, then under *Moderator tools** choose **Upload media**

3. Open a folder, select, drag, or paste media to upload. This supports images, gifs, and videos. Cloudinary provides optimized links for images, but you'll want to optimize other formats before uploading.

4. Copy the file URL and insert wherever you need it

## Uploading assets using the Cloudinary website

1. Go to the [Cloudinary dashboard](https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-112bd66abc0aa594ac70f206d45dc7/media_library/folders/c715b6391489025283fd69ae547ae8adb9?view_mode=list) and log in. (Find the login in 1Password.)
    
    _Pro tip: Double-click a folder to drill in, despite the cursor pointer indicating it's a link you only need to click once._
1. Click 'Upload' in the top right, then drag and drop. **The upload button will not appear unless you follow the exact link above into the image folder.**
1. Add the filename (and any folders) to the base asset URL:
   ```
   https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/
   ```
1. Use the full URL in your docs or handbook update

title: Managing small teams
---

Small team pages are managed in a few places:

1. MDX files in the repo under `/contents/teams/{team-name}`
   - _Quarterly goals, team-specific handbook content_
2. Team records in our CMS, with all fields editable directly on the small team page
   - _Team photo, mission, crest_
3. Small team FAQs
   - _Aggregated from team member profiles, and from our CMS_

### Team page content

Any MDX files in the repo will display below the team members and _recently shipped_ sections.

### Quarterly goals

We're moving toward having quarterly goals in their own MDX files, like `2024-Q1.mdx`. This will allow us to show the current team goals, while displaying previous goals in an accordion.

Until then, when adding quarterly goals for a new quarter, add them to the `index.mdx` file and move the previous goals into a section below them (rather than deleting):

```
## Previous goals

<details>
<summary>Q3 2024 goals</summary>

### Goal 1

- Details
- More details

### Goal 2

- Details
- More details

</details>
```

See the Website & Vibes team's [small team page](/teams/website-vibes) as an example of how it will look.

## Team management

### Creating a new small team

#### Website steps
1. Make sure you're logged in to your community account
2. Navigate to `/teams`
3. Click the _New team_ button
4. Fill in all fields
5. Click _Save & publish_

#### Repo steps
1. Create a directory for the team in `/contents/teams/{team-name}` and duplicate `index.mdx` and `objectives.mdx` from another team as a starting point
2. Add the team's name to `src/navs/index.js` under the `companyMenu` section in alphabetical order under the _Engineering_ or _Not engineering_ heading

The new team will be added to the _Teams_ page on the next build.

### Editing a small team

1. Make sure you're logged in to your community account
2. Navigate to the small team page you wish to edit
3. Click the _Edit_ button (bottom right corner)
4. Edit the desired fields
5. Click _Save_

#### Add content to the small team's page

Visit the new small team page to:

1. Add team members (Login, click the Edit button bottom-right)
1. Assign the team lead (click the crown icon)
1. Update the team photo and caption (click the team photo to upload)
1. Update the team's mission
1. Update the team crest (click _Edit crest_ to customize your team's crest)

#### Other tasks

1. [Request a custom team crest](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=art-request-template.md&title=Art+request+-+%7Btitle%7D) from Lottie. Describe your team with a few adjectives, maybe physical tools that can be used in an illustration, and a sentence or two about what you do. She'll create two versions: a large one (for your small team's page) and a miniature version used in other places (like the [careers page](/careers)).
3. Add the team's feature ownership to the [feature list](/handbook/engineering/feature-ownership)
4. [Create a new team on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams) and remove the new members from their previous team
5. Give that newly-created team Direct Access with Write permission to the [`posthog`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/settings/access) and [`posthog.com`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/settings/access) repositories, as well as any other repos they will be contributing to frequently. This allows team members request review from their team instead of having to tag members individually.
6. Create the new `feature/team-{team-name}` labels [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/labels)
7. On Slack, create a new channel called #team-{team-name}. Add a new People > User group with the handle @team-{team-name}-folks. Add / Remove people from other groups as necessary.
8. If there are existing forum topics or roadmap items, re-assign them to the new team.
    - Make sure there's [a group in Zendesk](https://posthoghelp.zendesk.com/admin/people/team/groups) for the new team, and add the `zendeskGroupID` to the team's record in Strapi so community questions are routed to the right team in Zendesk. (Ask the Website & Docs team for help here.)
9. Update small team names in [Ashby](https://app.ashbyhq.com/admin/organizational-settings/custom-fields/job/6897f288-b46e-4d51-9bd9-aeb20ad8e62f). These are used to categorize jobs by team on the [careers page](/careers).

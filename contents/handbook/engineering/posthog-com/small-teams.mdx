title: Managing small teams
---

Small team pages are managed in a few places:

1. MDX files in the repo under `/contents/teams/{team-name}`
   - _Quarterly goals, team-specific handbook content_
2. Team records in our CMS, with most fields editable directly on the small team page
   - _Team photo, mission, crest_
3. Small team FAQs
   - _Aggregated from team member profiles, and from our CMS_

### Changing the header image

To change your team's image, send it to [#team-website-and-docs](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C01V9AT7DK4).

### Changing a mission

Change a small team's mission by clicking _edit mission_ on the small team page.

### Team page content

Any MDX files in the repo will display below the team members and _recently shipped_ sections.

### Quarterly goals

We're moving toward having quarterly goals in their own MDX files, like `2024-Q1.mdx`. This will allow us to show the current team goals, while displaying previous goals in an accordion.

Until then, when adding quarterly goals for a new quarter, add them to the `index.mdx` file and move the previous goals into a section below them (rather than deleting):

```
## Previous goals

<details>
<summary>Q3 2024 goals</summary>

### Goal 1

- Details
- More details

### Goal 2

- Details
- More details

</details>
```

See the Website & Vibes team's [small team page](/teams/website-vibes) as an example of how it will look.

## Team management

### Creating a new small team

#### Initial setup in Strapi

> This config needs to be done in our CMS. Ask the Website & Docs team for help here.

1. Create Team record
2. Add the [placeholder crest](https://www.figma.com/design/QCYxjm4wVVVvs6UA27xRmz/Website-art?node-id=2043-2&t=aO62tCO12PoIZMt9-1) with the new team's name on it

#### Setup in the repo

1. Create a directory for the team in `/contents/teams/{team-name}` and duplicate `index.mdx` and `objectives.mdx` from another team as a starting point
2. Add the team's name to `src/navs/index.js` under the `companyMenu` section in alphabetical order under the _Engineering_ or _Not engineering_ heading
3. Rebuild the site (after the Strapi configuration) to see the new page

#### Add content to the small team's page

Visit the new small team page to:

1. Add team members
1. Assign the team lead (click the crown icon)
1. Add a mission
1. Ask the Website & Docs team to create a team in Strapi and upload a team photo

#### Other tasks

1. [Request a custom team crest](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=art-request-template.md&title=Art+request+-+%7Btitle%7D) from Lottie. Describe your team with a few adjectives, maybe physical tools that can be used in an illustration, and a sentence or two about what you do. She'll create two versions: a large one (for your small team's page) and a miniature version used in other places (like the [careers page](/careers)).
3. Add the team's feature ownership to the [feature list](/handbook/engineering/feature-ownership)
4. [Create a new team on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams) and remove the new members from their previous team
5. Create the new `feature/team-{team-name}` labels [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/labels)
6. On Slack, create a new channel called #team-{team-name}. Add a new People > User group with the handle @team-{team-name}-folks. Add / Remove people from other groups as necessary.
7. If there are existing forum topics or roadmap items, re-assign them to the new team.
    - Make sure there's [a group in Zendesk](https://posthoghelp.zendesk.com/admin/people/team/groups) for the new team, and add the `zendeskGroupID` to the team's record in Strapi so community questions are routed to the right team in Zendesk. (Ask the Website & Docs team for help here.)
8. Update small team names in [Ashby](https://app.ashbyhq.com/admin/organizational-settings/custom-fields/job/6897f288-b46e-4d51-9bd9-aeb20ad8e62f). These are used to categorize jobs by team on the [careers page](/careers).

### Managing a small team

To manage content on the small team page, see the [Add content to the small team's page](#add-content-to-the-small-teams-page) section above.

To change the photo, ask the Website & Docs team.

### Removing a small team

Ask the Website & Docs team for help.

**Note:** When a small team is removed, all previous site builds will fail and will need to be rebuilt. Remind the team to merge `master` into any WIP branch.

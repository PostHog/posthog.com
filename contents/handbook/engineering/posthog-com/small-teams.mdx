title: Managing small teams
---

## Creating a new job

- Create a directory and team file in the repo (eg: `/contents/teams/team-name/index.mdx`)
- Ask Lottie to create a new team crest
- Ask Website & Docs Team to create a team in Strapi and upload a team photo*
- Once the page is previewable (on its Vercel branch), login to the website to:
  - add team members
  - assign the team lead (the crown icon)
  - add a mission

*This is temporary / will be self-serve via the website in the future


## FYIs

- Any MDX files in the repo will display below the team members and _recently shipped_ sections.

## In the future

- We're moving toward having quarterly goals in their own MDX files, like `2024-Q1.mdx`. This will allow us to show the current team goals, while displaying previous goals in an accordion.
- Moderators will be able to create teams directly on the website (no Strapi required)

## Removing a small team

Ask the Website & Docs team for help.

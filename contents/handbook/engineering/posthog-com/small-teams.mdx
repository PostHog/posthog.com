## Managing a small team

### Creating a new job

- Create a directory and team file in the repo (eg: `/contents/teams/team-name/index.mdx`)
- Ask Lottie to create a new team crest
- Ask Website & Docs Team to create a team in Strapi and upload a team photo*
- Once the page is previewable (on its Vercel branch), login to the website to:
  - add team members
  - assign the team lead (the crown icon)
  - add a mission

*This is temporary / will be self-serve via the website in the future

### Changing the header image

To change your team's image, send it to [#team-website-and-docs](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C01V9AT7DK4).

### FYIs

- Any MDX files in the repo will display below the team members and _recently shipped_ sections.

### In the future

- We're moving toward having quarterly goals in their own MDX files, like `2024-Q1.mdx`. This will allow us to show the current team goals, while displaying previous goals in an accordion.
- Moderators will be able to create teams directly on the website (no Strapi required)

## Team management

### Creating a new small team

#### Initial setup in Strapi

> There's some manual config that needs to be done in our CMS. Ask the Website & Docs team for help here.

1. Create Team record
2. Add the [placeholder crest](https://www.figma.com/design/QCYxjm4wVVVvs6UA27xRmz/Website-art?node-id=2043-2&t=aO62tCO12PoIZMt9-1) with the new team's name on it
3. Go to small team members' profiles, add them to the team, remove from other teams, and assign the team lead
4. Publish the changes to the team record

#### Setup in the repo

1. Create a directory for the team in `/contents/teams/{team-name}` and duplicate `index.mdx` and `objectives.mdx` from another team as a starting point
2. Add the team's name to `src/navs/index.js` under the `companyMenu` section in alphabetical order under the _Engineering_ or _Not engineering_ heading
3. Rebuild the site (after the Strapi configuration) to see the new page

#### Other tasks

1. Request a custom team crest from Lottie. Describe your team with a few adjectives, maybe physical tools that can be used in an illustration, and a sentence or two about what you do.
2. Add the small team's mission on their page once the site is built
3. Add the team's feature ownership to the [feature list](/handbook/engineering/feature-ownership)
4. [Create a new team on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams) and remove the new members from their previous team
5. Create the new `feature/team-{team-name}` labels [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/labels)
6. On Slack, create a new channel called #team-{team-name}. Add a new People > User group with the handle @team-{team-name}-folks. Add / Remove people from other groups as necessary.

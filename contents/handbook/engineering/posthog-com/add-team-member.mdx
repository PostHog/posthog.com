title: Adding a team member
---

The Brand & Vibes team oversees the process of completing their website profile so it's ready to go when they start. (The one exception is that the team lead or the Ops team will add the team member to the small team's page which will automatically add the person to the [team page](/team) the next time the website is rebuilt.)

When a new team member is created in Deel with their new company email, a community profile is automatically generated for them. It should populate with info like their name, role, and start date.

One thing it doesn't automatically add is their profile photo. Here's the typical process for completing their profile, which is handled by the Brand & Vibes Team.

## Add the team member's photo

1. Watch for alerts that the new team member has been created (in the `#alerts-deel` private Slack channel). It's always worth keeping an eye on new hire announcements in `#general` in case the webhook doesn't fire.
1. Verify their preferred name in their onboarding issue in `posthog/company-internal`, as their legal name automatically gets set by default based on the information added to Deel.
1. Grab their photo from their LinkedIn or other easily publicly-available source. If they've already started, they may have also uploaded a photo to Slack.
1. Copy photo to clipboard, visit [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/), paste the image, and download the resulting photo.
1. Crop to square, size similarly to existing images, and make sure the arm on the left side of the photo isn't cropped.
1. Optimize the image
1. Add to team member's profile
    - If the person hasn't started yet, this can be done in Strapi
    - If the person has started, webmasters can add it via the person's community profile on PostHog.com
1. Set a complimentary background color that isn't overly used by other members in the small team
1. Set their location field to a friendly name or major metropolis if in the US (like "San Francisco, CA") or a major international city (like "Barcelona, Spain") when possible.

Also add the team member's _original_ photo to the [Team portraits Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/EwK9O1CLyrRlYBxhIT4Ty9/Team-portraits?node-id=847-23&t=wZG5YcTKK7AnqaSl-1) where our contract illustrator will pick it up to draw the illustrated version.

Once notified in `#portraits` that the illustration is ready...

## After illustration is drawn...

1. Ensure proper sizing and positioning in Figma
1. Export at @2x to PNG
1. Optimize the image
1. Add to team member's profile via their profile page
1. Move the team member's photo to the `live` page in the Figma file

## Notes

- If the new team member lives in a country we haven't hired from before, we'll need to add a new flag sticker for their country. Ask <TeamMember name="Cory Watilo" photo /> to do this.
- We'll use the team member's public photo by default
- They have an option to ask the Brand & Vibes team to use a different photo, but if they don't, we'll roll with the public photo

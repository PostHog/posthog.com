## Codeblocks

The PostHog website has a custom codeblock component that comes with a number of useful features built-in:

- [Syntax highlighting](#adding-syntax-highlighting)
- [Multiple snippets in a single codeblock](#multiple-code-snippets-in-one-block)
- [Specifying which file a snippet is from](#specifying-which-file-a-snippet-is-from)

### Basic codeblock

Codeblocks in PostHog are created by enclosing your snippet using three backticks (\`\`\`) or three tildes (\~\~\~), as shown below:

~~~mdx
```
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```
~~~

This will produce the following codeblock:

```
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```

### Adding syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting can be added by specifying a language for the codeblock, which is done by appending the name of the language directly after the opening backticks or tildes as shown below.

~~~mdx
```json
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```
~~~

This will produce the following output:

```json
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```

### Supported languages

Here is a list of all the languages that are supported in codeblocks:

##### Frontend

|  |  |
| -- | -- |
| HTML | `html` |
| CSS / SCSS / LESS | `css` / `less` |
| JavaScript | `js` |
| JSX | `jsx` |
| TypeScript | `ts` |
| TSX | `tsx` |
| Swift | `swift` |
| Dart | `dart` |
| Objective-C | `objectivec` |

##### Backend

| | |
| -- | -- |
| Node.js | `node` |
| Elixir | `elixir` |
| Golang | `go` |
| Java | `java` |
| PHP | `php` |
| Ruby | `ruby` |
| Python | `python` |
| C / C++ | `c` / `cpp`

##### Misc.

| | |
| -- | -- |
| Terminal | `bash` or `shell` |
| JSON | `json` |
| XML | `xml` |
| SQL | `sql` |
| GraphQL | `graphql` |
| Markdown | `markdown` |
| MDX | `mdx` |
| YAML | `yaml` |
| Git | `git` |

> **Note:** If you want syntax highlighting for a snippet in another language, feel free to add your language to the imports [here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/149c7c2a99d66c4f961b538edb864c63ce186967/src/components/CodeBlock/languages.tsx#L6) and open a PR.


### Multiple code snippets in one block

With PostHog's `MultiLanguage` component, it's possible to group multiple code snippets together into a single block.

~~~mdx
<MultiLanguage>

```js
console.log("Hello world!")
```

```html
<div>Hello world!</div>
```

</MultiLanguage>
~~~

> **Note:** Make sure to include empty lines between all your code snippets, as well as above and below the `MultiLanguage` tag

This will render the following codeblock:

<MultiLanguage>

```js
console.log("Hello world!")
```

```html
<div>Hello world!</div>
```

</MultiLanguage>

### Specifying which file a snippet is from

You can specify a filename that a code snippet belongs to using the `file` parameter, which will be displayed in the top bar of the block.

~~~mdx
```yaml file=values.yaml
cloud: 'aws'
ingress:
    hostname: <your-hostname>
    nginx:
        enabled: true
cert-manager:
    enabled: true
```
~~~

> **Note:** Make sure **not** to surround your filename in quotes. Each parameter-value pair is delimited by spaces.

This produces the following codeblock:

```yaml file=values.yaml
cloud: 'aws'
ingress:
    hostname: <your-hostname>
    nginx:
        enabled: true
cert-manager:
    enabled: true
```

title: MDX components
---

There are some nifty MDX components available for use in Markdown content. Because these components are included globally, you don't need to do anything special to use them (like renaming `.md` to `.mdx` or manually importing them at the top of the file).

## Images

### Product screenshot

The `<ProductScreenshot />` component encapsulates an image with a border and background. It's useful since the app's background matches the website background, and without using this component, it can be hard to differentiate between the screenshot and normal page content. It also optionally supports dark mode screenshots.

You use it by passing image URLs to the `imageLight` and `imageDark` props like this:

```
<ProductScreenshot
  imageLight="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/handbook/images/tutorials/limit-session-recordings/sampling-config-light.png"
  imageDark="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/posthog.com/contents/handbook/images/tutorials/limit-session-recordings/sampling-config-dark.png"
  alt="Sampling config shown set to 100% i.e. no sampling"
  classes="rounded"
/>
```

Optionally pass `zoom={false}` if you don't want the image to be zoomable, otherwise it will be zoomable by default.

_Note: If you don't have a dark image, just leave out the `imageDark` prop and the light screenshot will be used for both color modes._

### Image slider

You can create a slider or carousel of images by wrapping them in the `<ImageSlider>` component like this:

```
<ImageSlider>

![posthog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/hogflix-dashboard.png)

![posthog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/hogflix-dashboard.png)

</ImageSlider>
```

See an example in our [open-source analytics tools post](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools#1-posthog).

## Product videos

Th `<ProductVideo />` component works the same as product screenshots (above) but supports light and dark videos.

1. Import the video(s) at the top of the post (directly following the MDX file's frontmatter and dashes):

```
---
export const NewFunnelLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/video/upload/posthog.com/contents/handbook/images/docs/user-guides/funnels/new-funnel.mp4"
export const NewFunnelDark = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/video/upload/posthog.com/contents/handbook/images/docs/user-guides/funnels/new-funnel-dark.mp4"

```

1. Use the component wherever you want the video(s) to appear.

```
<ProductVideo
  videoLight={NewFunnelLight}
  videoDark={NewFunnelDark}
  classes="rounded"
/>
```

_Note: If you don't have a dark video, just leave out the `videoDark` prop and the light video will be used for both color modes._

## Codeblocks

The PostHog website has a custom codeblock component that comes with a number of useful features built-in:

-   [Syntax highDarking](#adding-syntax-highlighting)
-   [Multiple snippets in a single codeblock](#multiple-code-snippets-in-one-block)
-   [Specifying which file a snippet is from](#specifying-which-file-a-snippet-is-from)

### Basic codeblock

Codeblocks in PostHog are created by enclosing your snippet using three backticks (\`\`\`) or three tildes (\~\~\~), as shown below:

````mdx
```
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```
````

This will produce the following codeblock:

```
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```

### Adding syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting can be added by specifying a language for the codeblock, which is done by appending the name of the language directly after the opening backticks or tildes as shown below.

````mdx
```json
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```
````

This will produce the following output:

```json
{
    "name": "Max, Hedgehog in Residence",
    "age": 2
}
```

### Supported languages

Here is a list of all the languages that are supported in codeblocks:

##### Frontend

|                   |                |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| HTML              | `html`         |

| Git      | `git`             |

> **Note:** If you want syntax highlighting for a snippet in another language, feel free to add your language to the imports [here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/149c7c2a99d66c4f961b538edb864c63ce186967/src/components/CodeBlock/languages.tsx#L6) and open a PR.

### Multiple code snippets in one block

With PostHog's `MultiLanguage` component, it's possible to group multiple code snippets together into a single block.

````mdx
<MultiLanguage>

```js
console.log('Hello world!')
```

```html
<div>Hello world!</div>
```

</MultiLanguage>
````

> **Note:** Make sure to include empty lines between all your code snippets, as well as above and below the `MultiLanguage` tag

This will render the following codeblock:

<MultiLanguage>

```js
console.log('Hello world!')
```

```html
<div>Hello world!</div>
```

</MultiLanguage>

### Specifying which file a snippet is from

You can specify a filename that a code snippet belongs to using the `file` parameter, which will be displayed in the top bar of the block.

````mdx
```yaml file=values.yaml
cloud: 'aws'
ingress:
    hostname: <your-hostname>
    nginx:
        enabled: true
cert-manager:
    enabled: true
```
````

> **Note:** Make sure **not** to surround your filename in quotes. Each parameter-value pair is delimited by spaces.

This produces the following codeblock:

```yaml file=values.yaml
cloud: 'aws'
ingress:
    hostname: <your-hostname>
    nginx:
        enabled: true
cert-manager:
    enabled: true
```

## Links

### Linking internally

Use Markdown's standard syntax for linking internally.

```
[Link text](/absolute-path/to/url)
```

Be sure to use _relative links_ (exclude `https://posthog.com`) with _absolute paths_ (reference the root of the domain with a preceding `/`).

|                      |                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Correct syntax**   | `/absolute-path/to/url`                    |
| **Incorrect syntax** | `https://posthog.com/absolute-path/to/url` |

### Linking externally

The `<Link />` component is used throughout the site, and is accessible within Markdown. (When used _internally_, it takes advantage of <Link to="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-link/" external>Gatsby's `<Link />` features</Link> like prefetching and client-side navigation between routes).

While that doesn't apply here, using it comes with some handy parameters that you can see in action via the link above:

-   Add `external` to a) open the link in a new tab, and b) add the _external link_ icon (for UX best practices if forcing a link to open in a new window)
-   If, for some reason, you need to hide the icon, use `externalNoIcon` instead

Example:

```
<Link to="#" external>
  click here
</Link>

```

### Private links

Sometimes we link to confidential information in our handbook. Since the handbook is public, it's useful to indicate when a link is private so visitors aren't confused as to why they can't access a URL. Use the `<PrivateLink />` component for this. ([Here's an example.](/handbook/people/share-options#what-are-my-share-options-actually-worth))

```
<PrivateLink url="https://path/to/private/link">
  click here
</PrivateLink>

```

Private links will always open in a new tab.

## Mention a team member

Use this component to mention a team member in a post. It will link to their community profile and appears like this: <TeamMember name="Cory Watilo" />

```
<TeamMember name="Cory Watilo" />
```

There's also a `photo` parameter which will inline their photo next to their name like this: <TeamMember name="Cory Watilo" photo />

## Mention a small team

Use this component to mention a small team in a post. It will link to their team page and appears like this: <SmallTeam slug="brand-vibes" />

```
<SmallTeam slug="brand-vibes" />
```

The default version shows the team's mini crest and name in a bordered "chip" style. There's also a `noMiniCrest` parameter to omit the mini crest and border for inline usage like this: <SmallTeam slug="brand-vibes" noMiniCrest />

```
<SmallTeam slug="brand-vibes" noMiniCrest />
```

Both versions will show the full team crest on hover. Clicking the tooltip will open the team page in a new window.

## Embedded posts

You can embed what looks like ~~a Tweet~~ an X post using the `<Tweet>` component. It's used on the [terms](/terms) and [privacy policy](/privacy) pages, but was componentized for use in blog posts to break up bullet points at the top of the post.

_Note: This does **not** actually embed an X post; it's just styled to look like one._

<Tweet alertMessage="Gen Z? Don't get distracted. You're here to read our exciting embedded post component.">
    Here's what a post looks like. It's designed to have a familiar look that makes it easy to scan.
</Tweet>

<Tweet alertMessage="Gen Z? Don't get distracted. You're here to read our exciting embedded post component.">
    If you show multiple posts in a row, they'll be connected by a vertical line to make it look like a thread.
</Tweet>

**Usage**

Be sure to change the alert message which appears if you click one of the action buttons (reply, repost, like).

```
<Tweet
    className="mx-auto"
    alertMessage="Gen Z? Don't get distracted. You're here to read our exciting embedded post component."
>
    If you show multiple posts in a row, they'll be connected by a vertical line to make it look like a thread.
</Tweet>
```

You can optionally center the post with the `mx-auto` class (shown in the example code, but _not_ used in the preview above).

title: Merch store development

You'll need to set environment variables to source products from Shopify and build [the merch store](/merch).

```
SHOPIFY_APP_PASSWORD=
GATSBY_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN=
```

We don't include these by default as sourcing the products from Shopify takes an absurd amount of time. Ask the [Website & Vibes](/teams/website-vibes) team if you need these values.

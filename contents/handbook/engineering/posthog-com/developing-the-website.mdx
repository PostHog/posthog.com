You can contribute to the PostHog documentation, handbook, and blog in three ways:

1. **Quick edits via GitHub UI.** For any page with an **Edit this page** link, you can use the GitHub web editor. This is best for text-only edits and basic file manipulation (renames, moving files).
2. **Local/Codespaces development.** Run the website locally or in Codespaces, create a branch, commit changes, and open a PR. This is recommended for anything non-trivial. There are guidelines on how to get setup and do this below.
3. **Request changes via the Website team.** This is the recommended approach for creating new landing pages or altering product pages, where there are some non-obvious design elements that require a lot of context to work with. 

Details on how to get started with each of these options is below.

<details>
<summary>Method 1: Running with codespaces</summary>

### Creating/running the codespace

1. Open the [posthog.com repository](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com) in GitHub.
1. Click the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab, then under the `...` menu, choose **New with options...**
    ![New with options...](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_new_ef2888e9b2.png)
1. Under **Machine type**, choose **4-core**.
    ![Configure machine type](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_configure_74499bde9c.png)
1. When the repo opens in Codespaces, it will install some things automatically.
    ![Codespaces installing dependencies](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_auto_setup_4db1dd65e0.png)

    When completed, press any key.
1. In terminal, type `yarn && yarn start` and hit [Enter].
    ![yarn start](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_yarn_b02a89ed6b.png)
    - This will take a while. The last step of the process is "Building development bundle" which will take a few minutes on its own.
    - You may see a dialog that says, "Your application running on port 8001 is available." Don't be enticed by the big green button quite yet.
1. Once you see <code><span class="text-green">success</span> Writing page-data.json files...</code>, you can click the green **Open in browser** button which will open the site at [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001).

    You can also click the **Ports** tab to access the URL where you can preview the site. Cmd + click the URL seen here.
    ![port](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/port_ec6ab549ce.png)

### Committing and pushing changes

Use the built-in Git tab in VS Code to commit and push your changes.

1. From the Git source control `...` menu, choose **Checkout to...** to create a new branch.
    ![Checkout to...](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_checkout_e634e2c0c0.png)
1. Type a new branch name and press enter.
    ![Branch name](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_branch_name_89ff5c8314.png)
1. Now you can commit changes to your new branch. Type a commit message and use `Cmd` + `Enter` (or push the big green button).
    ![Commit message](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_commit_cbe6e34635.png)
1. If you see the dialog below, choose **Always** to always stage all files you've changed. (Otherwise, you'll need to hit the `+` button next to each file you want to commit.)
    ![Stage all](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_commit_directly_f9d811d6d3.png)
1. Now that your changes are committed, it's time to publish them to GitHub.
    ![Publish changes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_publish_81f21426e4.png)

> **Note:** After finishing changes on your branch, be sure to switch back to `master` so you don't inadvertently make future changes to your current branch.
> ![Checkout to master](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_checkout_master_4821478b5e.png)
> ![Switch to master](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/codespaces_select_branch_58c9512cee.png)

### Stopping the server

1. Place your cursor into Terminal and type `Cmd+C` to stop the server.
1. In the bottom left corner of the window, click **Codespaces: [your codespace name]**, then **Stop current codespace.**

### Notes

If you plan on using this codespace frequently, disable **Auto-delete codespace** in the `...` menu under the **Code > Codespaces**  dropdown [in the repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog.com).

Once you have Codespaces setup, you can easily start making edits. 
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Method 2: Edit posthog.com locally</strong></summary>

## Prerequisites
Install:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- (Apple silicon) [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211861)

Optional helpers:
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (recommended)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Cloning the repo

From the command line:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PostHog/posthog.com.git
cd posthog.com
```

From GitHub Desktop:

- Go to the repo
- Click Code → Open with GitHub Desktop → Clone
- Once cloned, click Open in VS Code

## Running locally
Apple silicon only:

```bash
rm -rf ./node_modules
brew install vips
```

Install dependencies and start the site:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```
Once built, open http://localhost:8001 to start previewing your local environment. You can then start modifying the code and previewing how changes appear. When your changes are ready, you can commit them.

## Committing changes

It's best to create commits that are focused on one specific area. For example, create one commit for textual changes and another for functional ones. Another example is creating a commit for changes to a section of the handbook and a different commit for updates to the documentation. This helps the pull request review process and also means specific commits can be [cherry picked](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick).

### Committing via the command line

First, stage your changes:

```bash
git add [path-to-file]
```

For example:

```bash
git add contents/docs/contribute/updating-documentation.md
```

Once all the files that have been changed are staged, you can perform the commit:

```bash
git commit -m '[short commit message]'
```

For example:

```bash
git commit -m 'Adding details on how to commit'
```

### Committing via GitHub Desktop**

Files that have been changed can be viewed within GitHub Desktop along with a diff of the specific change.

![Viewing changes in GitHub Desktop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/contribute/viewing-changes-in-github-desktop.png)

Select the files that you want to be part of the commit by ensuring the checkbox to the left of the file is checked within GitHub Desktop. Then, write a short descriptive commit message and click the **Commit to...** button.

![Making a commit in GitHub Desktop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/contribute/commit-in-github-desktop.gif)

## Pushing changes to GitHub

In order to request that the changes you have made are merged into the main website branch you must first push them to GitHub.

### Pushing via the command line

```bash
git push origin [branch-name]
```

For example:

```bash
git push origin posthog-website-contribution
```

When this is done, the command line will show output similar to the following:

```bash
posthog-website-contribution $ git push origin posthog-website-contribution
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'posthog-website-contribution' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/new/posthog-website-contribution
remote: 
To github.com:PostHog/posthog.com.git
* [new branch]        posthog-website-contribution -> posthog-website-contribution
```

This output tells you that you can create a pull request by visiting a link. In the case above, the link is `https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/new/posthog-website-contribution`. Follow the link to complete your pull request.

### Pushing via GitHub Desktop

Once you have committed the changes you want to push to GitHub, click the **Push origin** button.

![Push to origin from GitHub Desktop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/contribute/push-to-origin-github-desktop.gif)

## Creating a pull request (PR)

Create a PR to request that your changes be merged into the main branch of the repository.

### Creating PRs from the command line

Navigate to the link shown when you push your branch to GitHub. For example, `https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/new/posthog-website-contribution` shown below:

```bash
posthog-website-contribution $ git push origin posthog-website-contribution
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'posthog-website-contribution' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/new/posthog-website-contribution
remote: 
To github.com:PostHog/posthog.com.git
* [new branch]        posthog-website-contribution -> posthog-website-contribution
```

### Creating PRs via GitHub Desktop

With the branch published, click the **Create pull request** button.

![pull request from GitHub Desktop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/contribute/github-desktop-pull-request.png)

This will open up a page on github.com in your default web browser.

If you are pushing to an existing branch, navigate to the [posthog.com repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog.com) and switch to the new branch using the dropdown:

![GitHub branch switcher](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/contribute/github-branch-switcher.png)

Then, open the **Contribute** dropdown and click the **Open pull request** button.

Make the pull request title descriptive name and complete the detail requested in the body.

If you know who you would like to review the pull request, select them in the **Reviewers** dropdown.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Method 3: Briefing the website team</summary>

Some parts of the site have non-obvious design elements, such as responsive layouts, which are currently best handled by the Website team. If you want to make changes to these sections, or create wholly new pages with unique layouts, you should request them from the Website team. 

We have a template setup to help you brief the team directly. You should aim to give the Website team at least two weeks notice of your request if possible and should provide a full draft of the content you want on the new page. All new web requests are tagged with the `new landing page` tag so you can filter them easily. 

If you have questions about a brief, please ask in [the #posthogdotcom Slack channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C08UABF7PB7).

</details>

## Can't I just vibecode it?

Vibecoding is good for quick prototypes, but generally doesn't produce better results than the methods above. This is especially true when creating new landing pages, as these pages have complex requirements. You usually can get a vibecoded version to a reasonable state in a local preview, but it tends to then be harder for others to approve and fix as they have to untangle your machine-made code. 

If you're committed to vibecoding we *strongly* recommend giving your AI tool of choice some appropriate context first by pointing it at the following files:

- `posthog.com/contents/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/developing-the-website.mdx`
- `posthog.com/contents/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/how-posthog-website-works.mdx`
- `posthog.com/README.md`
- `posthog.com/src/components/Products/Slides/examples.md`
- `posthog.com/contents/example-components.mdx`

After you've created something, then spend time using prompts such as:


"Imagine you were a senior engineer who owned this project before these changes, how would you criticize your code? Please create a multi step plan to improve the code quality.

"Is the CSS and design of this change in line with how the rest of the website is styled and designed? If not, please create a plan for how to refactor this change."
We plan to regularly revisit this guidance as AI coding tools improve.

## Making changes to posthog.com

Below we've collected some guidance on how different parts of the site function and some broad advice for editing them. For more information on the site architecture, check out [how the PostHog website works](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/how-posthog-website-works)

### Markdown details

Most parts of the website, including the docs, handbook, and blog, are built from Markdown files with a simple structure. 

#### Frontmatter

Most PostHog pages utilize frontmatter as a way of providing additional data to the page. Available frontmatter varies based on the template the page uses. Templates are determined based on the folder the file resides in:

##### Blog

Markdown files located in `/contents/blog`

```markdown

##### Comparison pages

Create a table on a "PostHog vs..." page with the following components. (You can see examples of how this is used [in this pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/7001).)

**Import the components at the top of the post content (after frontmatter):**

```
import { ComparisonTable } from 'components/ComparisonTable'
import { ComparisonRow } from 'components/ComparisonTable/row'
import { ComparisonHeader } from 'components/ComparisonTable/header'
```

**Create a table like:**

```
<ComparisonTable column1="Company name 1" column2="Company name 2">
  <ComparisonHeader category="Optional header row" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="Text" feature="Feature name" description="Feature description" />
</ComparisonTable>
```

In `ComparisonRow`:
- Values for `column1` and `column2` can be: `{true}` | `{false}` | `"Text string"`
- `feature` is required but `description` can be omitted (only if not using that column for the entire table)

##### Customers

##### Plain

If the file doesn't reside in one of the above folders, it uses the plain template.

```markdown
---
title: Example Components
showTitle: false
width: lg
noindex: true
---
```

- `title`: the title that appears at the top of the page
- `showTitle`: `false` - if omitted, the title will appear at the top of the page
- `width`: `sm` | `md` | `lg` | `full` - determines the width of the page
- `noindex`: `true` | `false` - determines whether to index the page or not
- `seo`: object containing SEO metadata:
  - `metaTitle`: String
  - `metaDescription`: String


You can often refer to the source of existing pages for more examples, but if in doubt, you can always [ask for help](https://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal).

#### Images/GIFs

If you need to upload images, you can [upload them to Cloudinary](/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/assets)

To include an image in a markdown file, you can use Cloudinary URLs, like so:

```markdown
![Twin Peaks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/handbook/engineering/images/02/IMG_4294-scaled.jpg)
```

In this case, `Twin Peaks` is the alt-text applied to the image.

#### Links to/from the navigation

Once you've made a new markdown file, you should link to it from the sidebar where appropriate.

The sidebar is generated from `src/navs/index.js`.

#### Redirects

Redirects are managed in `vercel.json` which is located in the root folder.

To declare a new redirect, open `vercel.json` and add an entry to the `redirects` list:

```
{ "source": "/docs/contributing/stack", "destination": "/docs/contribute/stack" }
```

The default HTTP status code is 308 (permanent), but if the redirect should be temporary (307), it can be updated like this:

```
{ "source": "/docs/contributing/stack", "destination": "/docs/contribute/stack", "permanent": false }
```

## Preview branch

When a PR is created a series of checks are run (to ensure nothing in your breaks the website) and Vercel will generate a preview link available in the Vercel bot comment. This includes all of your changes, so you can preview before your pull request is merged. This is also helpful for reviewers.

An initial build can take up to 50 minutes to run. After the initial build, subsequent builds should complete in under ~15 minutes. We're limited to two concurrent builds, so if there's a backlog, this process can take longer.

Because Vercel charges per seat, we don't automatically invite all team members to our Vercel account. If your build fails, you can run `yarn build` locally to see what's erroring out. If nothing is erroring locally, it's likely the build timed out in Vercel. The Website & Docs team monitors for failed builds, so they'll re-run it for you. If the build is urgent, give a shout in #team-website-and-docs and someone with Vercel access can trigger a rebuild for you.

![Preview branch](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/docs/contribute/preview-branch.png)

> **Note:** Checks are run automatically for PostHog org members and previous contributors. First time contributors will require authorization for checks to be run by a PostHog org member.

## Deployment

To get changes into production, the website deploys automatically from `master`. The build takes up to an hour, but can be delayed if other preview builds are in the queue.

title: Product & feature comparisons
---

We maintain a single source of truth for both:

-   the features of each product
-   our competitors across all of their products and features

By having a single source of truth, we're able to keep this data up-to-date across product comparison tables, blog posts, and other documentation.

## Product features

```
/src/hooks/featureDefinitions/{productName}.tsx
```

-   summary
    -   name
    -   description
-   {sectionName}
    -   description
    -   features
        -   {featureName}
            -   name
            -   description

## Competitors

```
/src/hooks/competitorData/{competitorName}.tsx
```

Contains:

-   name
-   key
-   assets
    -   icon
    -   comparisonArticle
-   products
    -   {productName}
        -   availability
        -   features
            -   {featureName}
                -   name
                -   description
-   platform
-   pricing

## Referencing data

-   `dashboards` returns value of `availabile` and displays the feature's name and description from `summary`
-   `dashboards.features` returns all features from the array, with their name and description
-   `dashboards.features.annotations` will return an individual feature

### How do I get access?

Ask in the `#team-platform` Slack channel for someone to add you. Anyone who is an owner can do so.

To give someone access: Navigate to [Posthog team settings page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/team?i=7cfa7c) and use the `Invite Members` button to add their Posthog email address.

### Edit 1-Click app info

This can be done in the [vendor portal](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/vendorportal/), click on `PostHog` with Approved status to edit the listing.

The code and setup files are in [digitalocean/marketplace-kubernetes repository](https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-kubernetes/tree/master/stacks/posthog).

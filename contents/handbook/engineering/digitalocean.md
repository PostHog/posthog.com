### How do I get access?

Ask in the `#team-platform` Slack channel for someone to add you. Anyone who is an owner can do so.

To give someone access: Navigate to [Posthog team settings page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/team?i=7cfa7c) and use the `Invite Members` button to add their Posthog email address.

### Deploying Posthog

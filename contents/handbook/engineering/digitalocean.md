### How do I get access?

Ask in slack in #team-deployments-and-infrastructure as someone needs to add you. Though note that anyone who is an owner in the Posthog team can do it.

To give someone access: navigate to [Posthog team settings page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/team?i=7cfa7c) and use the Invite Members button.

### Deploying Posthog

See docs [here](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/digital-ocean).

The [Core Experience Team](/handbook/people/team-structure/core-experience) and [Core Analytics Team](/handbook/people/team-structure/core-analytics) are both working towards achieving [feature parity](/handbook/strategy/roadmap#1-reach-parity) with other leading product analytics tools ([more context](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/41)). This will be more of an ongoing effort rather than a fixed point.

> The goal of this document is providing context on **progress towards feature parity**.

Last updated: **Jun 3, 2021**

-   This page gets updated every 2 weeks after each sprint retrospective and planning.
-   **This is a high-level list of features.** Issues contain further details.
-   This page is not used to track down every task, bug or improvement in the product. Each team has its own GitHub project for that. We just track **high-level features** in this page.
-   Issues might not yet include a comprehensive description of all requirements / specifications.
-   This page does not contain details on PostHog's entire journey to feature parity, but rather starting from the split of Core Experience and Core Analytics [small teams](/handbook/people/team-structure/why-small-teams), May 21, 2021 (release 26-1).
-   Because this page contains high-level features, some of this may require multiple sprint/release cycles to be completed. The _Shipping Release_ column details the sprint/release when the feature was finished and shipped.

### Core Experience

-   Working on **3 tasks** during current release cycle (26-2).
-   To date, **14 tasks** are outstanding.
-   Completed **1 task** since May 24th.

The [Core Experience Team](/handbook/people/team-structure/core-experience) and [Core Analytics Team](/handbook/people/team-structure/core-analytics) are both working towards achieving [feature parity](/handbook/strategy/roadmap#1-reach-parity) with other leading product analytics tools ([more context](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/41)). This will be more of an ongoing effort rather than a fixed point.

> The goal of this document is providing context on **progress towards feature parity**.

### Core Analytics

### Housekeeping

-   This page gets updated every 2 weeks after each sprint retrospective and planning.
-   **This is a high-level list of features.** Issues contain further details.
-   This page is not used to track down every task, bug or improvement in the product. Each team has its own GitHub project for that. We just track **high-level features** in this page.
-   Issues might not yet include a comprehensive description of all requirements / specifications.
-   This page does not contain details on PostHog's entire journey to feature parity, but rather starting from the split of Core Experience and Core Analytics [small teams](/handbook/people/team-structure/why-small-teams), May 24, 2021.

Max AI is PostHog's AI-powered platform that lets users interact with PostHog's products through a chat interface. The Max AI team is responsible for building and maintaining this AI platform.

## What is Max AI?

Max AI enables users to:

- Ask questions about their data in natural language
- Generate insights and reports through conversation
- Navigate PostHog's products using AI assistance
- Automate common analytics tasks

We want Max to work with _every_ PostHog product, so that we can at some stage make a chat (or even complete automation with approval steps as necessary) the default experience for people using PostHog, then resorting to clicking the UX as the backup option for _most_ tasks.

## How to work with the Max AI team

**Products already integrated with Max always have a supporting engineer assigned on the Max team.**

This naturally distributes AI knowledge throughout the organization, while ensuring high-quality AI features that integrate properly with the platform. Implementing something new, missing features in the Max API, or seeing failures? Your supporting engineer is your go-to! Tag them directly on your PRs and questions.

**If your team is integrating AI features for the first time – the Max AI team will do their best to assign a supporting engineer.**

Just message about your plans in the #team-max-ai channel in Slack.

### Getting started

If you need AI capabilities for your product area:

1. **Reach out early**: Contact the Max AI team lead at #team-max-ai in Slack to discuss your requirements
2. **Define the use case**: Be specific about what AI functionality you need, or consult with us if you're trying to flesh out ideas
3. **Plan the collaboration**: Work with the Max AI team to determine the best approach (e.g., sending an engineer to your team for a sprint or a few sprints vs. building the feature in Max AI directly without your involvement, or you just being able to do it solo)
4. **Coordinate sprints**: Align on timing and resource allocation if needed. This shouldn't feel like a heavyweight process, if it is - we should change it

### Best practices

- **Start small**: Begin with simple AI features and iterate based on user feedback. A lot of automation can be broken down into smaller, automatable steps!
- **Avoid death by random AI widgets - maintain consistency**: Ensure AI features follow PostHog's design patterns and user experience standards. Max AI team can help if you are missing a UX pattern.

### How do I get access?

Ask someone in the `#team-platform` Slack channel to add you. Anyone who has edit access can do so.

To give someone access: Navigate to [Posthog project IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=posthog-301601&supportedpurview=project) and use the `+Add` button at the top to add their PostHog email address and toggle `Basic` -> `Editor` role.

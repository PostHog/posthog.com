### How do I get access?

Ask in slack in #team-deployments-and-infrastructure as someone needs to add you. Though note that anyone who has edit access can do it.

To give someone access: navigate to [Posthog project IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=posthog-301601&supportedpurview=project) and use the +Add button at the top to add their posthog email and Basic -> Editor role.

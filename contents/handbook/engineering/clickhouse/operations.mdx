title: Operations
---

This document gives an overview of the kitchen side of ClickHouse: how various operations work,
what tricky migrations we have experience with as well as various settings and tips.

## Settings

ClickHouse provides daunting amounts of configuration on all levels. This section provides
information on the different kind of settings and how to configure them.

### Query settings

Query settings allow to manipulate the behavior of queries, for example setting limits on
query execution time and resource usage or toggling specific behaviors on-and-off.

Documentation:
- [Settings](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings)
- [Restrictions on Query Complexity](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/query-complexity/)

Using query settings is done:
- at query-time via ClickHouse client library arguments (preferred)
- at query-time via explicit [`SETTINGS` clause in queries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/)
- via `users.xml` file to apply to all queries

### Server settings

Server settings allow tuning things like global thread or pool sizes, networking and other `clickhouse-server`-level configuration.

Documentation:
- [Server Settings](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings/)

You can change server settings via `config.xml` file. **Note:** some settings may require a server restart.

### MergeTree table settings

MergeTree settings allow configuring things from primary index granularity to merge behavior to limits of usage of this table.

Documentation:
- [MergeTree tables settings](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings/)
- Undocumented settings can be found in [the source code](https://clickhouse.com/codebrowser/ClickHouse/src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeSettings.h.html)

MergeTree table settings are set either:
- at table creation time
- or via [`ALTER TABLE ... SETTING`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/setting) statement

### Profiles and users

ClickHouse allows creating different profiles and users with their own set of settings. This can
be useful to grant read-only access to some users or otherwise limit resource use.

## Mutations

`ALTER TABLE ... UPDATE` and `ALTER TABLE ... DELETE` operations which mutate data require ClickHouse to
rewrite whole data via special merge operations. These are frequently expensive operations and require monitoring.

You can monitor progress of mutations via the following system tables:
- [`system.mutations`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/mutations/)
- [`system.merges`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/merges) - see `is_mutation` column
- [`system.replication_queue`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/replication_queue)

When creating mutations, it's often wise to alter the value of [`mutations_sync` setting](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#mutations_sync).

Running mutations can be stopped by issuing a [`KILL MUTATION WHERE mutation_id = '...'`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/kill/) statement.

Note that this may not stop any currently running merges. To do so, check out [section on `SYSTEM STOP MERGES`](/handbook/engineering/clickhouse/operations#system-stop-merges)

### GDPR

When necessary to delete user data due to GDPR or otherwise, it's wise to do so in batches and asynchronously.

At PostHog, when deleting user data, we schedule for all deletions to occur once per week to minimize the cost
of rewriting data.

In the future, [lightweight deletes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/delete/) might simplify this process.

## Merges

[As explained previously](/handbook/engineering/clickhouse/data-storage#what-does-the-merge-stand-for), merges are the lifeblood
of ClickHouse, responsible for optimizing how data is laid out on disk as well as for deduplicating data.

Merges can be monitored via the following tables:
- [`system.merges`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/merges)
- [`system.replication_queue`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/replication_queue)

### `OPTIMIZE TABLE`

[`OPTIMIZE TABLE`] statement schedules merges for a table, optimizing the on-disk layout or speeding up queries or
[forcing some schema changes into effect.](/handbook/engineering/clickhouse/operations#simple-schema-changes)

**Note:** not all parts are guaranteed to be merged if the size of parts exceeds maximum limits or if data is already in a single part.
In this case adding a `FINAL` modifier forces the merge regardless.

### `SYSTEM STOP MERGES`

[`SYSTEM STOP MERGES`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/system/#stop-merges) statement can stop background merges
from occurring temporarily for a table or the whole database. This can be useful during trickier schema migrations when copying data.

Note unless ingestion is paused during this time, this can easily lead to `too many parts` errors.

Merges can be resumed via [`SYSTEM START MERGES`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/system/#start-merges) statement.

### Important settings

Merges have many relevant settings associated to be cognizant about:
- [`parts_to_throw_insert`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings/#parts-to-throw-insert) controls when ClickHouse starts
    when parts count gets high.
- [max_bytes_to_merge_at_max_space_in_pool](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings/#max-bytes-to-merge-at-max-space-in-pool) controls maximum part size
- [`background_pool_size`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings/#background_pool_size) (and related)
    server settings control how many merges are executed in parallel
- Undocumented `max_replicated_mutations_in_queue` and `max_replicated_merges_in_queue` settings control how many merges are processed at once

## Simple schema changes

As in any other database, schema changes are done via [`ALTER TABLE`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/) statements.

One area where ClickHouse differs from other databases is that schema changes are generally lazy and apply to only new data or merged parts. This applies to:
- Adding or removing columns, changing default values
- Changing compression of columns
- Updating table settings

You can generally force these changes onto old data by forcing data to be merged via
 [`OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/optimize/)
statement, but this can be expensive.

## TTLs

[ClickHouse TTLs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/ttl/) allow dropping old rows or columns after expiry.

It's suggested to set up your table to partition by timestamp as well, so old files can be dropped completely instead of needing to be
rewritten as a result of TTL.

## Tricky schema changes

Some schema changes are deceptively hard and frequently requires rewriting the whole table or re-creating
the tables.

Make sure to never re-use Zookeeper paths when re-creating replicated table!

The difference often comes down to [how data is stored on disk](/handbook/engineering/clickhouse/data-storage) and its implications.

### Async migrations

At PostHog, we've developed Async Migrations for executing these long-running operations in the background without affecting availability.

You can learn more about Async Migrations in our [blog](/blog/async-migrations), [handbook](/handbook/engineering/databases/async-migrations) and
[runbook](/docs/runbook/async-migrations).

### Pausing ingestion

This is frequently a prerequisite of any large-scale schema change as new data may get lost when you are copying data from
one place to another.

If you're using [Kafka engine tables for ingestion](/handbook/engineering/clickhouse/data-ingestion#how-kafka-tables-work), you can pause
ingestion by dropping materialized view(s) attached to Kafka engine tables.

To restart ingestion, recreate the dropped table(s).

### Changing table engines

When changing table engines, you can leverage [`ALTER PARTITION`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition/)
commands to move data between tables.

**Note:** ALTER PARTITION commands only work if the two tables have identical structure: same columns and ORDER BY/PARTITION BY. It works by
creating hard links between partitions, so the operation does not require any extra disk space until merges happen.

Thus it's important to stop ingesting new data and merges during this operation.

PostHog needed to implement this kind of operation to move to a sharded schema:
[`0004_replicated_schema.py`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/3573aa41941a152e57e0f23fba7a2d1e83a9a9af/posthog/async_migrations/migrations/0004_replicated_schema.py).

### Changing `ORDER BY` or `PARTITION BY`

Changing `ORDER BY` and `PARTITION BY` affects how data is stored on disk and requires rewriting this data.

Suggested procedure if using `ReplacingMergeTree`:
1. Create a new table with correct `ORDER BY`
2. Create a new materialized view table, writing new data to new table.
3. Copy data over from old table via [`INSERT INTO SELECT`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/insert-into/#inserting-the-results-of-select)
4. Deduplicate via `OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL` if feasible.

Note that INSERT-ing data this way may be slow or time out. Consider:
- Dropping any materialized columns temporarily
- Increasing query settings `max_execution_time`, `send_timeout`, `receive_timeout` timeouts to be large enough
- Finding correct values for query settings `max_block_size`, `max_insert_block_size`, `max_threads`, `max_insert_threads`
- Setting `optimize_on_insert` setting to `0`

Note that this operation temporarily doubles the amount of disk space you need.

An example (from PostHog) of an async migration: [0005_person_replacing_by_version.py](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/50deeae355af35b3512097ebdc592c9fadd84bb4/posthog/async_migrations/migrations/0005_person_replacing_by_version.py)

### Resharding

At PostHog, we've haven't had to reshard data (yet), but the process would look similar to changing `ORDER BY` or `PARTITION BY`, requiring either to pause data or deduplicate at the end.

Storing/restoring parts of data from backups might also simplify this process.

### Denormalizing columns via dictionaries

A powerful tool in the arsenal of performance is de-normalization of data.

At PostHog, we eliminated some JOINs for person data by storing information on person identities and properties directly on events.

Backfilling this data was implemented via `ALTER TABLE UPDATE` populating new columns. The column data was pulled in
[using dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/external-dictionaries/external-dicts/)
which allowed to query and store data from other tables in memory during the update.

An alternative approach might have been to create a new table and populate it similar to changing `ORDER BY`, but this
would have required expensive deduplication, a lot of extra space and even more memory usage.

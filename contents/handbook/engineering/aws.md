### How do I get access?

Ask in the `#team-platform` Slack channel for someone to add you. Anyone who has edit access can do so.

To give someone access: navigate to [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users) and use the `Add Users` button at the top right to add their PostHog email as username, pick `AWS Management Console access` and add them to the `Team` group, then Slack them the sign-in URL, username, and password.

### Permissions errors using aws cli

If you see something like:
```
<my-user> is not authorized to perform: <action> on resource: <resource> with an explicit deny
```

Note the "with an explicit deny" in the end which likely is due to the fact that we force Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Follow [this guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/) to use a session token. 

TLDR:

1. Look up your security credential MFA device name from AWS console from `https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/<user-name>?section=security_credentials`
2. Run `aws sts get-session-token --serial-number <arn-of-the-mfa-device> --token-code <code-from-token> --duration 129600` where `code-from-token` is the same code you'd use to login to the AWS console (e.g. from Authy app).
3. Run the following code, replacing the placeholder values with the appropriate ones:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=example-access-key-as-in-previous-output
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=example-secret-access-key-as-in-previous-output
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=example-session-token-as-in-previous-output
```
4. Unset them when done (after they expire before running `get-session-token` again):
```
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID && unset AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY && unset AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

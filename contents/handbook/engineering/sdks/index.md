There is now a small, dedicated SDK team at PostHog ([@PostHog/team-client-libraries](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams/team-client-libraries)) that helps drive direction and coordination. However, SDK development and maintenance remains a collaborative effort across the engineering organization. [@PostHog/client-libraries-approvers](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams/client-libraries-approvers) exists in GitHub to coordinate the collaboration for those who are more interested than normal in the development of these SDKs.

## How SDK work gets done

SDKs are maintained by engineers across different teams who either:

- Volunteer for the [SDK support rotation](/handbook/engineering/sdks/support-rotation) to help with issues and bug fixes
- Contribute improvements when their team's product needs SDK changes (e.g., adding session replay support to a new SDK)
- Pick up SDK work during hack days or when they have spare capacity

This distributed model means SDKs get attention from engineers with diverse expertise, and ownership is shared across the company.

### Want to get more deeply involved?

If you're interested in contributing to our SDKs — whether that's fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation — drop a message in **#team-client-libraries**. We're always happy to have more people helping out, and it's a great way to learn about different parts of the PostHog ecosystem.

You can also sign up for the [SDK support rotation](/handbook/engineering/sdks/support-rotation) to get hands-on experience with SDK issues.

## Slack channels

- **#team-client-libraries** — Main channel for SDK discussions and general questions
- **#support-client-libraries** — Main channel for SDK support discussions, handovers between support rotation engineers 
- **#approvals-client-libraries** — Where release approval requests are posted (see [Releases](/handbook/engineering/sdks/releases))



## What are our SDKs?

There are too many to have a static list here. Check the [libraries docs](/docs/libraries) to learn more about them.

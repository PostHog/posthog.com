> PostHog's mission is to increase the number of successful products in the world.

##Companies we build for

PostHog is *used* by companies of every scale - hobbyists, startups, scale ups and enterprises.

We're *focused* on companies that _must_ self host their product analytics. These companies:

* Often have large volumes of events to track. This means we need individual deployments to scale to millions of events.
* Often use data warehouses. This means working nicely with a data warehouse is important to us.
* Often struggle to get event data out of their product. This means we need great SDKs.
* Often in industries that care about brand or privacy - scale up tech companies, dev tools, healthcare, fin tech. This is important when we think about content marketing.

For these teams, the alternative to using PostHog is to hire data analysts to write SQL to understand user behavior. We stop data analysts writing repetitive queries, and enable engineers or product managers to easily answer questions about user behavior by themselves.

##Users we build for

The users we prioritize are engineers (often a senior one) or product managers with some technical skills. Our adoption is bottom-up by these users.

We are focused on [enthusiast or visionary personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm#synopsis). We are _not_ targeting those who want to use more mature technologies.

Our users value control and transparency.

##What we are building

We provide a _platform_. Our functionality helps teams move towards an iterative product development cycle. That means:

1. Form a hypothesis about what to build
1. Release a change to their product
1. Understand the impact of the change, then go back to step 1.

PostHog consolidates a fragmented set of tools in the market to do the above. By having everything in one place - feature flags, event pipeline, data warehouse connectivity, product analytics, session recording, etc, there is more data and more power through the integrated use cases of these products.

Being open source lets others truly build on our platform - it gives more control and transparency to our users, and means we're quickly becoming a standard solution for those that must self host their product analytics.

##The future

Cloud means the cost of storage and compute have decreased. Data warehouses are coming into companies much earlier than ever before. Products like BigQuery are growing very rapidly.

More software in future will be directly powered by data warehouses. Currently, there is no strong solution providing product analytics on top of a data warehouse.

PostHog will become the standard platform used to extra product data, to provide tools to understand and improve product usage, and to integrate well with a data warehouse.

## Next Up

We've a [public roadmap](roadmap).

Working here already and wondering what to build next? We have a [prioritization framework](/handbook/strategy/prioritization) to figure out what to work on.

We have a [strategy project](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/5), which is visible for PostHog team members.

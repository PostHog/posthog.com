## Mission

**_“Increase the number of successful products in the world”_**

We do this by **helping engineers be better at product**.

## Context

PostHog helps engineers be better at product through a suite of tools that we call a “Product OS” (product analytics, session recordings, feature flags, experiments, and a lightweight CDP). We build for and sell to product engineers at high-growth startups. Our competitors provide point solutions focused on (non-technical) product managers. Focusing on engineers enables us to get in earlier and empower the engineer to own product outcomes - owning the market for product tools.

We now add more companies each week than _any_ closed-source SaaS rival, and we're the open-source standard for all our applications. Financially, we're in a great position - default alive, and profitable within the next 12 months.

## Strategy

Our strategy is to focus on these three things:

_Provide every tool needed for evaluating feature success._ The best use of an engineer's time is to ship features that have an impact on customers. Currently, this requires a large number of tools and product managers to pull all the insights together. By integrating all these tools we can make this easy - no integration needed, no extra vendors, no extra javascript, and workflows to guide engineers through feature development.

_Get in first._ By already being used by our customers, we’re the default for each additional tool they add. It’s the technical co-founder and early engineers building the MVP and integrating the first product tools, not PMs. By focusing on engineers we can be their preferred choice and get in first. Additionally, we can ladder our tools - for example, session recording is used much earlier in the life cycle of the product than others like the CDPs helping us get in earlier than competing products.

_Be the pipeline for product and customer data._ Traditionally, as companies scale their data warehouse becomes the source of truth and non-warehouse native tools (like product analytics) become less relevant. By being their core pipeline from connecting their data to their warehouses we can remain sticky for the life of our customers. And by providing this infra, we ensure the data we have remains comprehensive.

## 2026 vision

**Where do we want to get to?**

In 2026: _The leading product teams use PostHog to build the best products._

*Product team = The people building the product. Normally engineers, PMs and designers.*

We are the first product tool that technical founders integrate into their product. We scale with them from their first user; to their first dollar; to 1000 person engineering orgs; IPO; and beyond. The best product people don't want to join a company that's not using PostHog.

We become the customer's data platform for customer and product data. We enable other users throughout the org to use customer and product data initially by building tools for the data engineers. Overall, we replace the data warehouse and CDP.

We could go public with $100M ARR from the following:

1) 1,000 companies building successful products with us, paying $25K each
2) 500 companies building successful products with us, paying $50K each
3) 50 companies building successful products with us, paying $1M each

We did this by first focusing on high-growth self-serve startups to nail (1) and (2). This gave us the strong brand, product, and financial position to win (3).

## 2023 vision

* Creating workflows around evaluating features to automate a lot of traditional Product Management work
  * We are the only company that can do this because we provide all the tools in one
* Improve the core UX to be more focused on product engineers:
  * A slick experience
  * More powerful querying than our competitors can offer (for example, SQL access) that answers the long tail of questions
  * PostHog 3000 UX = a design uplift including dark mode to encourage more word of mouth
* Launching our CDP solution as a full product
  * We already are this for lots of users, and we’ve even had ~45 community-built data connectors or transformations
  * However, our CDP lacks integrations, reliability and has a low-quality UX - so we will work on these next quarter
* Become known as the first tool that engineers add to their product
  * Work on top-of-funnel growth in high potential startups (whereas last year we primarily focused on monetization of high growth startups)
  * Create a more precise approach to this (growth model / CS focus / marketing focus)

### This quarter - OKRs

Welcome to the PostHog Handbook! If you are a new starter, this page will help you navigate the Handbook and highlight some of the most important things you should know about working here. 

## Big picture

We encourage everyone to start at the beginning first before diving in. We have a strong bias for action, but it is still worth taking a step back and looking at the 'why' first. This helps ensure sure you have the right context and are working on the right things. 

You should start with the '[Company](/handbook/company/story)' section and work your way through everything there. It is not a lot to read. In particular, the sections on our [Strategy](handbook/strategy/strategy) and [Roadmap](/handbook/strategy/roadmap) are a must-read for everyone. 

Next, familiarise yourself with our approach to [Culture](/handbook/company/culture) and our [Values](/handbook/company/values). You might take a bit of time to adjust to PostHog's way of working, and that's ok! In addition to bias for action, you may find that you have a lot more autonomy than you are used to here - you'll realise very quickly that you _shouldn't_ be asking for permission for most things. 

## How we work

Now it's time to dive into some of the more practical stuff - these are the most important pages:

1. [Communication](/handbook/company/communication) - we have a distinctive style. If PostHog is your first all-remote company, this page is especially helpful.
2. [Team structure](/handbook/people/team-structure/team-structure) - we are structured in Small Teams. These pages will help you get the lay of the land, and who does what. 
3. [Management](/handbook/company/management) - we have a relatively unusual approach to management, and it is possible that you will not be familiar with our approach. 

### Working in GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog) for _everything_, including non-engineering task management. This might take some getting used to if you are non-technical. If that is the case, we have [this intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BB4Nkc0uVM) that will teach you the basics. 

Our most active repositories (aka 'repos') are:

- [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) - main app
- [PostHog.com](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com) - website
- [Internal](https://github.com/PostHog/internal) - company-facing issues (private)

We use GitHub Projects to track the status of Issues in an easily viewable way. It is up to each Small Team to decide how to manage their tasks, and you'll find most have a dedicated Project - [full list here](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects) - and run two week sprints. As part of onboarding, you will be invited to the relevant planning meetings. 

## Onboarding 

Our [onboarding checklist](/handbook/people/onboarding) will take you through all the main admin bits you need to get set up, such as accounts access and payroll. The list will vary slightly depending on where you are based and which Small Team you are in. The People team will create an Issue in the Internal repo to track your personal checklist. 

### Other useful resources

It is worth trying to at least read the entire Handbook once, even if you skim over the other sections. If you are engineer, the [Engineering](/handbook/engineering/development-process) section will obviously be useful, but you might want to know how we're approaching our [Marketing](/handbook/growth/marketing) strategy.

A few additional pages that may occasionally come in handy:

- [Media](/media) - official PostHog logos and backgrounds
- [Customer Support](/handbook/growth/customer-success) - we don't have a dedicated support team. Learn why!
- [Benefits](/handbook/people/benefits) - we are adding more all the time!

These are the principles for the behavior we care about.

## 1. We are open source

Building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to [PostHog's strategy](/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist).

We default to transparency with everything we work on. That means we make a lot of things public: our handbook, [our roadmap](/handbook/strategy/roadmap), [how we pay](/handbook/people/compensation) (or even [let go of](/handbook/people/offboarding)) people, [what our strategy is](/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist), and [who we have raised money from](/handbook/strategy/investors). Internally, we go even further – providing financial information, live updates on fundraising, and board slide access.

This enables the strongest community growth possible. It causes the core team to raise the bar on their work, it provides the context needed for people to work across multiple timezones, and it enables a deep work-heavy and meeting-light culture. It creates trust.

## 2. We haven't built our defining feature yet

Ideas are fragile. Be direct but encouraging when you encounter new ideas. If we default to providing negative criticism of new ideas, then they'll simply stop coming. Instead, default to "yes and" rather than "no, but", before rejecting an idea.

We should never stop iterating. You learn faster and help PostHog perform better by getting what you're working on into the real world. We expect you to ship new designs, features, or whatever is needed for your role in tiny chunks, frequently, and often before you feel ready.

## 3. Everyone codes

... although this doesn't mean everyone has to be a software developer, and not everyone needs experience in this before they join. Our platform's adoption starts with developers using our open-source project, so we use GitHub to share most of our work publicly and to build a large community of technical users.

No matter your role, being able to use the basics of GitHub helps you understand our audience. Beyond that, we'll encourage you to build your technical skill, rather than delegating more challenging tasks to others, so you become a more effective contributor.

## 4. Trust and feedback over process

There are two ways to scale – trust and feedback, or process. We choose the former because we're building a wide platform with many products, so autonomy is more important than control. We hire people that work well with high level direction and will step on toes if needed to get things done.

When giving or receiving feedback, we assume positive intentions and focus on giving specific examples. Many of our team's peak experiences at PostHog have been receiving direct feedback. Feedback should be acknowledged, but what you do with it is up to you - no one built anything great by committee.

We expect you to pick out the very most important thing you can think of and work on that. Discard plans as you see fit.

We judge your performance based on the impact you deliver overall, no matter what your role.

> Not all process is bad. There are processes like our [issue templates for new teams](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-small-team.md) or our [quarterly planning process](/handbook/company/goal-setting) that, without being defined, would leave things in a confusing mess. Processes that speed us up are great. Processes that slow us down should be avoided.

## 5. Bias for action

We have learned the clearest lessons at PostHog by doing things, not from hypothesizing about them. If we're debating doing something, just trying it is the best way to learn.

Bias for action means getting things done _proactively_. You do not need consensus to do things – focus your energy on shipping what's most valuable for our customers and the company, then take ownership of making it happen, not on getting buy in from others.

Sometimes this approach might mean you ship something that others don't agree with. You will need to be willing to throw away work sometimes, because the upside – not needing to get lots of approval to do stuff and being able to take more bets – means we all move so much faster that mistakes are a lot less costly.

Bias for action doesn't just mean shipping huge product features. It may mean diving into a small customer support issue quickly to delight them – this is one of the main reasons people recommend us to others.

## 6. Talent compounds

Getting into PostHog is a huge challenge. Once you're here, it stays that way. We are *extremely* demanding of performance.

In return, you get to work with others producing the best work of their careers.

We are a team, not a family. This means we have very ambitious goals, [compensate](/handbook/people/compensation#how-it-works) generously and transparently, offer [exceptional benefits](/handbook/people/benefits), and do everything we can to provide an environment for you to do your best work.

Often this means everyone, [especially managers](/handbook/company/management), getting out of your way. It's also [not okay to let your teammates fail](/handbook/company/culture/#dont-let-others-fail). We expect everyone to provide direct feedback to help everyone perform at their best. We pay [generous severance](/handbook/people/compensation#severance) if things aren't working out.

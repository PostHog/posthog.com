The [Website & Docs Team](/teams/website-docs) is responsible for everything you see on posthog.com. We treat our website & docs as a product, which means we're constantly iterating on it and improving it.

Because our website has a well-defined aesthetic, we often skip the hifi design process and jump straight from wireframes into code. Having a designer who can code means we can reach the desired level of polish without _always_ having to produce hifi designs, thus leading to huge time savings.

Usually Eli will build 90% of a page and Cory will follow along (in code) with the final 10% of finishing touches.

## Step 1: Wireframes [Balsamiq]

We often produce hi-fidelity wireframes because this allows us to closely envision a design which in turn helps us skip the hi-fi Figma process.

Our [Balsamiq project](https://balsamiq.cloud/sd0i9zq/poenphz/rADB6) contains many page iterations. Typically we share the most up-to-date versions in the relevant GitHub issue. (We sometimes use Balsamiq to prototype complex flows.)

*Note: Balsamiq uses its own Comic Sans-style font. Don't get hung up on this!*

## Step 2: Hi-fi designs [Figma]

Designs live in the [posthog.com Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/CLj2U34xpNiHuZRo73GJPm/posthog.com?node-id=4046%3A85573). If there are multiple iterations of a single page, we typically work left to right.

Any mocks in pages that appear to be faded out are considered _old_ and _out of date_ and can be ignored, as there is a better replacement nearby. (We sometimes want to keep them around for easy reference (and to leave a comment trail), but they're easily identifiable because their artboards are set to 50% opacity.)

Even with this loosely-documented process, things move quickly and we don't always follow this process. If you're looking for something in particular, it's worth pinging in the [#team-website-and-docs](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C01V9AT7DK4) channel.

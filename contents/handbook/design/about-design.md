Designers are spread between Small Teams. Like sovereign states have ambassadors, our designers live on the ground in the places where we can tangibly offer support.

## People

| Name         | Role             | Team(s) |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| [Lottie Coxon](/handbook/company/team#lottie-coxon-graphic-designer) | Graphic Designer | Marketing, Growth  |
| [Cory Watilo](/handbook/company/team/#cory-watilo-lead-designer) (Team lead)  | Design Lead      | Growth  |

Design at PostHog:

- Supports Small Teams (and contributors) in building better versions of PostHog
- Enables customers to build better products (using PostHog)
- Communicates to prospective customers the value we provide

## How we work

Design tasks are managed on GitHub project boards and work is documented in Figma. See below:

### Product Design

Product design tasks are managed in boards where product designers primarily work (like [Core Experience](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/9), [Core Analytics](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/12)).

### Website & Docs (posthog.com)

The [Website & Docs board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/13) is used for enhancements to posthog.com marketing pages, our Docs, and Handbook. (Artwork for blog is handled separately, and is explained below.)

Because design and website development are closely related, we share a project board.

1. **[Design] Backlog** _- a mostly stack ranked list of tasks_
1. **[Design] In progress**
1. **Ready for development** _- completed designs that are awaiting implementation_
1. **[Development] Backlog** _- mostly stack ranked_
1. **[Development] In progress**
1. **Done**

Designs for website & docs typically start in Balsamiq wireframes, then progress into hi-fi designs in Figma. [Read more about this process.](/handbook/company/website-design-process)

### Blog artwork and marketing assets

Because of the volume of content we publish, blog artwork has its own dedicated [Artwork](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/14) project board managed by Lottie.

When [authoring a blog post](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog), add the `Artwork` project board so we can create visuals and make sure the post is listed on our [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit) with a publish date. [Learn more about our process.](/handbook/growth/marketing/exporting-blog-post-image)


It's also worth trying out [CustomHog](https://www.figma.com/file/HwUmk7WqccLkGgNNGAs4zN/Art-board?node-id=4168%3A24524) to create your own hedgehog content. (This function is still in early stages so if help is needed just reach out to Lottie on slack).

## **Providing feedback**

When we share a design, we do our best to explain the type of feedback we're looking for. (Ex: Overall visual aesthetic, flow, if a design communicates to our developer-focused audience, etc.)

If a screenshot is posted directly to a Github issue, that's a great place for feedback. (If a comment already covers your feedback, we encourage the use of an emoji response over additional comments like "+1".)

Some of the design tools we use, like Balsamiq and Figma, both have built-in commenting, which is useful for prototypes with multiple pages. If we provide a link to a prototype in one of these tools, please leave a comment using the app's comment system. This helps us review and take action on comments later, and creates a single place for discussion around a particular topic.

**Important:** We prioritize feedback based on alignment with business goals. _Everyone has feedback about design._ (If feedback is more of a personal opinion than a business-related perspective, weâ€™ll note it, but don't be offended if your feedback isn't specifically addressed!)

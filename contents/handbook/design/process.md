## No product design within small teams

We encourage engineers to act like feature owners, carrying a project from ideation to completion. We maintain a design system in [Storybook](https://storybook.posthog.net/), so engineers can build high-quality features independently, as much as possible.

Because engineers choose their sprint tasks near the beginning of a sprint (and product doesn't plan tasks _for_ engineers in advance), our process doesn't allow for us to have a product manager and a designer to work closely together before a task gets selected by an engineer.

In our process of short, 2-week sprints with no pre-planning, design would become a blocker to an engineer quickly iterating on a feature. Thus, engineers don't get support from product designers. Product designers should deliver high quality components. The product teams should have people in them that can ship good-enough quality interfaces using those components. If that's not true, we should hire or move people around.

Learn more about how we decide this in our [guide to working with product designers, for engineers](/handbook/engineering/product-design).

## "No design by default"

We encourage engineers to act like feature owners, carrying a project from ideation to completion. We maintain a design system in [Storybook](https://storybook.posthog.net/), so engineers can build high-quality features independently, as much as possible.

Because engineers choose their sprint tasks near the beginning of a sprint (and product doesn't plan tasks _for_ engineers in advance), our process doesn't allow for us to have a product manager and a designer to work closely together _before_ a task gets selected by an engineer.

In our process of short, 2-week sprints with no pre-planning, design would become a blocker to an engineer quickly iterating on a feature. Thus, we've settled on the general rule of that engineers don't get support from product designers _by default_.

This doesn't mean product design _should never_ be involved. But designers can weigh in on if their support would be useful for a given task, or if design is premature for a project.

Learn more about how we decide this in our [guide to working with product designers, for engineers](/handbook/engineering/product-design).

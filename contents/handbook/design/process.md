## "No design by default"

We encourage engineers to act like feature owners, carrying a project from ideation to completion. We maintain a design system in [Storybook](https://storybook.posthog.net/) so engineers can build high-quality features independently, as much as possible.

Because engineers choose their sprint tasks near the beginning of a sprint (and product doesn't plan tasks _for_ engineers in advance), our process doesn't allow for us to have a product manager and a designer to work closely together _before_ a task gets selected by an engineer.

In our process of short, 2-week sprints with no pre-planning, design would become a blocker to an engineer quickly iterating on a feature. Thus, we've settled on the general rule of that engineers don't get support from product designers _by default_.

This doesn't mean product design _should never_ be involved. But designers can weigh in on if their support would be useful for a given task, or if design is premature for a project.

Learn more about how we decide this in our [guide to working with product designers, for engineers](/handbook/engineering/product-design).

## Blog artwork and marketing assets

Because of the volume of content we publish, blog artwork has its own dedicated [Artwork](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/14) project board managed by Lottie.

When [authoring a blog post](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog), add the `Artwork` project board so we can create visuals and make sure the post is listed on our [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit) with a publish date.

It's also worth trying out [CustomHog](https://www.figma.com/file/HwUmk7WqccLkGgNNGAs4zN/Art-board?node-id=4168%3A24524) to create your own hedgehog content. (This function is still in early stages so if help is needed just reach out to Lottie on Slack).

**Important:** We prioritize feedback based on alignment with business goals. _Everyone has feedback about design._ (If feedback is more of a personal opinion than a business-related perspective, we’ll note it, but don't be offended if your feedback isn't specifically addressed!)

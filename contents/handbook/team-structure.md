We're organized the company into small teams that are multi-disciplinary and as self-sufficient as possible. [You can read about why we've done it this way](/handbook/company/small-teams), or [browse the small teams](/teams).

We maintain our full org chart in Deel, [which you can access here](https://app.deel.com/organization-chart/organization/834ac289-7c04-4d93-91f0-8922c5664b77?groupBy=group-by-report).

## Forming new small teams

Organizational changes usually happen at the small team level. Hereâ€™s what happens when we form a new small team: 

- [ ] Exec discusses with relevant team leads (and/or managers if applicable).
- [ ] Exec discusses with relevant team member(s). 
- [ ] Ops team updates the [Org Chart](https://app.deel.com/organization-chart/organization/834ac289-7c04-4d93-91f0-8922c5664b77?groupBy=group-by-report) in Deel.
- [ ] Ops creates an issue with [the small teams template](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-small-team.md) and assigns the team lead
- [ ] Exec informs everyone else in the company in the next all hands session.

The small teams template contains a list of tasks for the Ops team and the team lead. These include standard tasks, such as creating Slack groups and a team page to ensure the team can communicate efficiently. 

## What team leads do

Team leads do not necessarily = managers - read more about how we think about management [here](/handbook/company/management). 

Once a new Team Lead is appointed or a small team is created, team leaders take on additional responsibilities that are defined in [the new small team template](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-small-team.md), along with a checklist of actions. 

Team leads also take on a range of broader responsibilities that revolve around releasing new features and communicating with other teams. Some helpful guidelines on what team leads should be taking responsibility for are listed below. 

### Setting up support processes
Setting up support processes is a team lead responsibility, but if you need any assistance just contact the Support team directly.

Team leads are responsible for creating Slack channels for their support function and ensuring integration with Zendesk, so that the team can be alerted to support issues. Once the support process is set up, team leads are responsible for ensuring a sustainable and fair support rotation and setting up SLA and support hero notifications. 

Further details on how to do this are available in [the new small team template](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-small-team.md). 

### Launching new products and features
It's the responsibility of the team lead to keep Marketing and Billing teams informed about product progress so that product marketers can coordinate launches and the Billing team can implement pricing. 

Some guidelines on how to do this are below, but if in doubt team leads should always aim to overcommunicate with Marketing and Billing teams. 

### Adding ideas to the roadmap

- [ ] As soon as you start seriously planning a new product, add it to [the in-app feature preview roadmap](https://posthog.com/docs/feature-flags/early-access-feature-management) as a `concept`.
- [ ] Inform the marketing teams a new roadmap item is available via the #marketing channel

### Launching a new beta

- [ ] As soon as user opt-in is available, move your roadmap item from `concept` to `beta`
- [ ] Ensure your opt-in beta has a feedback link and docs link
- [ ] Inform the marketing teams a new beta is available via the #marketing channel

### Launching a new product

**Typically, you must give at least 2-3 weeks notice of a product launch and you should reach out directly to marketing team leads if this is not possible.**

- [ ] [Create a new launch plan issue](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/new?template=launch-plan-.md)
- [ ] Continue to communicate timelines / updates in the Slack channel created

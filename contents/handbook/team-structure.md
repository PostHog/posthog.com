## Small teams

We've organized the team into small teams that are multi-disciplinary and as self-sufficient as possible. [You can read about why we've done it this way](/handbook/company/small-teams).

Our small teams are:

- [Customer Success](/teams/customer-success)
- [Data Warehouse](/teams/data-warehouse)
- [Exec](/teams/exec)
- [Feature Success](/teams/feature-success)
- [Growth](/teams/growth)
- [Infrastructure](/teams/infrastructure)
- [Marketing](/teams/marketing)
- [People & Ops](/teams/people)
- [Pipeline](/teams/pipeline)
- [Product Analytics](/teams/product-analytics)
- [Replay](/teams/replay)
- [Web Analytics](/teams/web-analytics)
- [Website & Docs](/teams/website-docs)

## Reporting lines

We maintain our full org chart in Deel, [which you can access here](https://app.tryroots.io/org-chart).

Team leads do not necessarily = managers - read more about how we think about management [here](/handbook/company/management). 

## Organization changes

We’re still an early stage company, and so is our product. We strongly value moving and shipping fast (see [core values](/handbook/company/values)) and we constantly iterate not only our product but our organization too. As this happens, it may be quite possible that organizational changes occur. This mostly happens at the [small teams](/handbook/company/small-teams) level. To make the changes smoother for everyone, here’s the checklist we use:

- [ ] Discuss with relevant team leads (and/or managers if applicable).
- [ ] Discuss with relevant team member(s).
- [ ] Open a PR on `posthog.com` documenting the change on the handbook.
    - [ ] Update the relevant Small Team page.
    - [ ] Update the [Org Chart](https://app.tryroots.io/org-chart) in Deel.
- [ ] Let everyone else in the company know in the next all hands session.
- [ ] Add/remove from relevant [Sentry teams](https://sentry.io/settings/posthog/teams/).
- [ ] Add/remove from relevant [GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams).
- [ ] Add/remove from Slack `@` groups / team mentions (e.g. `@core-experience`).

### Team Lead checklist
- [ ] Onboarding 1:1 with new team member.
- [ ] Add to stand-ups, planning sessions, and any other team rituals.
- [ ] Update Slack channel description, and invite to Slack channel if needed.

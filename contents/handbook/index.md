Welcome to the PostHog Company Handbook. This explains how we operate as a company. If this is your first time here, we suggest starting with our [handy guide](/handbook/getting-started). 

The reason for making this transparent is to improve our communication, one of our [key values](/handbook/company/values).

Anyone can submit a pull request to suggest updates or enhancements to this handbook through the [PostHog.com repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog.com).

We treat this handbook as part of our Docs. Learn how to [update them](/docs/updating-documentation).

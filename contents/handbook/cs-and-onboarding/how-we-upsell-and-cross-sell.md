## **How to cross-sell and upsell additional PostHog products**

Successful expansion at PostHog comes from identifying genuine customer needs and demonstrating how additional products solve real problems. The goal is helping customers extract more value from PostHog, which naturally leads to increased product adoption. CSMs are not here to push new products and features; CSMs are here to ensure customers successfully use PostHog and get the most value for their business. Remember, we want to help our champions look like heroes at their companies!

### **Identifying expansion opportunities**

**Strong expansion signals:**

* Consistent usage approaching billing limits  
* Multiple departments accessing PostHog  
* Questions about problems that other PostHog products solve  
* 20%+ month-over-month event volume growth  
* Custom implementations replicating native PostHog features  
* Actively using PostHog competitors identified by using BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, or internal [SDK Scanner](https://sdk-scanner.posthog.dev).

**Common expansion paths:**

* **Product analytics → Session replay:** When customers struggle to understand user behavior from metrics alone  
* **Any product → Feature flags:** When teams need safer deployment strategies  
* **B2B companies → Group analytics:** When tracking company-level metrics becomes critical  
* **High event volume → Identified events:** When anonymous events limit user journey analysis  
* **Growing teams → Teams add-on:** When organizations need advanced permissions and SSO  
* **Customer facing teams → Session Replay:** When organizations need better user troubleshooting and support, not just user research into behavior.

### **Discovery through conversation**

Effective [discovery](https://posthog.com/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/getting-to-know-your-customers) focuses on understanding customer challenges rather than pushing products.

**High-value discovery questions for upsell/cross-sell:**

* "How does your team decide what to build next?"  
* "What's your process for investigating customer-reported issues?"  
* "How do you measure feature adoption across different customer segments?"  
* "What does your deployment process look like for major changes?"  
* "How do you validate that new features impact key metrics?"  
* “Are there other team members on different teams you could introduce me to or that you recommend I reach out to?” (Always, always, always be asking for “referrals” in this way\!)

These questions will naturally surface use cases for session replay, feature flags, experiments, and other products. Of course, we should also identify opportunities programmatically through the other data sources we have to supplement the conversation approach. 

### **Optimal timing for expansion discussions**

**Ideal moments:**

* Quarterly business reviews when setting future goals  
* After successful outcomes with current products  
* During team growth phases (new stakeholders bring new needs)  
* Annual renewal conversations (bundling opportunities)  
* When customers mention relevant challenges organically  
* Following positive business announcements (follow your accounts company pages on Linkedin, set Google alerts, etc)

**Times to avoid:**

* During active support issues  
* Within first 30 days (unless customer-initiated)  
* Following budget constraints announcements  
* When current implementation needs attention

### **Value-focused positioning**

Connect products to customer outcomes using their terminology and context. For example, any time you put additional burden on your champion or a stakeholder, you are less likely to help them achieve a positive outcome for us or for them. When you approach, provide them with a solution that will make their life better (and make them look better\!) it’s a win-win.f

Also note that a CSM’s awareness and insight into the customer’s business is really instrumental in having these kinds of conversations, which is why it’s important to find a way to become more embedded into your customer’s general flow, so that you feel to them as an extension of their team.

**Effective positioning examples:**

* **Session replay**: "You mentioned spending hours debugging that checkout issue last week. Session replay would show you exactly what users experienced."  
* **Feature flags**: "That rollback you had to do last month affected all users. Feature flags would have limited the impact to just 5% of traffic."  
* **Group analytics**: "You're currently exporting data to spreadsheets to analyze customer behavior. Group analytics provides those insights natively."

### **Expansion best practices**

**Do:**

* Focus on solving documented customer problems  
* Provide trial access for evaluation  
* Share relevant case studies and documentation  
* Set clear success criteria before expansion  
* Follow up on product experiments, even small ones

**Don't:**

* Recommend products without clear use cases (it’s okay to give awareness or suggest trying out something new)  
* Create urgency where none exists  
* Introduce expansion topics during crisis moments  
* Overwhelm customers with too many products at once

### **Measuring expansion success**

Track both leading and lagging indicators:

* Product trials started and completed  
* Time from trial to paid adoption  
* Multi-product adoption rates  
* Expansion revenue per account  
* Customer feedback on expanded products

Successful expansion strengthens customer relationships and increases account stickiness. Each additional product that delivers value makes PostHog more integral to the customer's operations.

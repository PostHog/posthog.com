## Introduction

When starting out as a Technical Customer Success Manager (CSM) at PostHog, you are assigned a book of business with ~30 accounts to work with. It is helpful to think of customer engagement in stages to help us identify how we should connect with customers at each stage.

## Stage 1: Introduction and discovery

Whether the account is getting handed off from an existing contact or you are establishing contact for the first time, it is helpful to get connected with a champion quickly, ideally multiple champions if possible. Find someone who can serve as your primary point of contact, but also try to connect with people from other teams. If the account hasn't been actively managed before, it is even more crucial that we try establishing a connection with anyone who is willing to talk. There is some helpful guidance in our [getting started with newly assigned customers](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/newly-assigned-customer) that can help you get started.

Your goal at this stage is to learn more about the company, get to know your champion, and understand their goals so you can determine where you can add the most value. Some things to consider on your discovery call:

- Who is your champion? What role or team are they on?
- What does their company do?
- What are their immediate and overall goals?
- What metrics do they deeply care about?
- Are they established for success with their current PostHog setup?
- What current PostHog products are they using, and how are they using them?
- Why aren't they using other PostHog products?
- Which teams are currently actively using PostHog at their company?
- Are there opportunities for other teams to adopt PostHog?
- Potential introductions to champions on another team to learn about their use case.
- [Review and discuss their current implementation](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/foundation-check) and if they have any concerns.
- Would it be helpful for you to review their account with them?
- Offer training and workshop sessions to see if their team would be interested.
- How does the customer feel about PostHog overall?

There are some additional recommended questions on our [getting to know your customers](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/getting-to-know-your-customers#getting-to-know-you-call) page that would also be helpful to consider. These are suggestions. You are the driver and can decide the best way to connect to the customer. The goal at this stage should be to learn as much as you can, so you know where you can add the most value, and to establish relationships with as many champions as you can. Not all of these questions need to be answered in a single discovery call or discussion, but ideally during this stage, you're spending time getting a good grasp on what matters most to your customers, whether they're setup for success or not, and if there are things you can do immediately to help optimize for their success, resolve implementation issues, or offer immediate training that their team can benefit from.

## Stage 2: Establishing trust

Once you've gone through your entire book of business and have completed stage 1, the next stage in our journey is to develop deep trust with our champions. Trust is built over time, based on our interactions and how we manage and nurture those relationships. This means being personable, helpful, and communicating in a timely manner when you think you have something to share, advocating for feature requests or following up on bugs, and keeping the customer up to date without them having to ask, staying on top of support questions, and, when possible, showing, not telling.

An example of show, not tell, is when a customer asks a support question, and rather than simply telling the customer how they can do something to fix the issue, if the opportunity is available for you to resolve the issue for the customer, such as creating an insight or dashboard on their behalf, do that instead. Confirm with the customer that this is what they're thinking of, then explain what you did to help teach them how they can accomplish the same thing moving forward. By doing the work for them, rather than simply telling them what they can do and linking to some documentation, we're doing as much as we can to be helpful, which goes a long way in being helpful and establishing trust.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with having to inform them of what needs to be done or linking to our documentation, but if the opportunity presents itself to be extra helpful, do so. It's essential to note that we don't want to create a habit for our customers that makes them dependent on us to continually generate insights or dashboards for them, or write custom SQL queries on their behalf. You'll want to balance this when attempting to be helpful, so as not to create the impression that we'll always do this for them.

Establishing trust can take time, and your communication style and actions can play a significant role. It may be worth offering recurring calls with your champion to establish more face-to-face contact, as this can help you maintain an ongoing pulse on what's happening.

## Stage 3: Getting deeply embedded with customers

At some point, you've gotten to know your champion well and have a fairly good understanding of their business goals, worked through implementation issues, and perhaps even tried cross-selling additional products to them. Now would be a great time to reach out and see if they're interested in conducting a deep dive and becoming more deeply embedded with their team to work through some of their goals. This could help establish new workflows or setups to gain deeper insights beyond what they've achieved.

Some customers may simply want a better way to understand specific statistics and are unsure of how to achieve this. Others may actually be looking to implement key changes and have PostHog be deeply embedded as a source of truth for what they're doing, and in some cases, re-imagine or re-architect their setup to be driven by PostHog data. This is a great opportunity to engage at a much deeper level with their team and explore how you can help them achieve true success with PostHog, as well as consider use cases they haven't thought of yet.

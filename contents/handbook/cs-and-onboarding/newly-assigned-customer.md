# Getting started with newly assigned customers

When you're assigned a new customer account, your approach will vary depending on their existing relationship with PostHog. This guide walks you through the key steps to take when welcoming new customers to your book.

## Determine which category your customer falls into

### No/low interaction with PostHog humans

These are customers who have been using PostHog but haven't had much direct contact with our team. They need a more thorough assessment before you do your initial outreach.

#### Do an audit of their account and business

Start by gathering context about who they are and how they're using PostHog:

**Understanding their business:**
- What industry are they in? What products do they make?
- If you have other customers in their industry, does their usage of PostHog fit what you've seen before?
- If there are products they aren't using that you've seen other customers in their industry find value from, take note of that to bring up later after you've done your discovery call.
- If you want to do an even deeper dive on the business side, the Sales team has a thorough [account planning template](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales/account-planning) that they use for cross-sell/expansion that you can take guidance from.

**Reviewing their PostHog setup:**
- What PostHog products are they using?
- Does their setup look complete? Check the items from their [health check](https://posthog.com/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/health-tracking)
- Review their [product onboarding](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales/account-allocation#product-onboarding) status

**Data management assessment:**
In their project(s), check the data management tab:
- Do they have custom events defined?
  - If no and they're using autocapture, have they defined [actions](/docs/data/actions)?
- For their custom events, do they have robust properties?
- If they're identifying persons or groups, have they defined a meaningful set of properties on those profiles?

Answering these questions helps you determine what may be the most important things to focus on and call out in your initial introduction.

#### Initial outreach

Once you've completed your audit:

- Look for who are the owners/admins on the account and most active users
- Do an initial outreach to those people
  - In your introduction, make it clear what you can help them with as a CSM
  - Based on your audit, add a specific note about something you noticed on their account, relevant training, or something specific you'd like to help them with
  - Suggest setting up a [Slack/Teams channel](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales/slack-channels) so they can easily reach you and other members of our team 

**Setting expectations:**
Once you've made contact, schedule a [discovery call](https://posthog.com/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/getting-to-know-your-customers#discovery-call) to better understand their goals and challenges.

The learnings from your discovery call should help you determine what the ongoing relationship will look like with the customer.
- Determine what is the goal you want to achieve with this customer? (Keep an eye on them vs. become more deeply embedded as a strategic partner)
  - If a customer needs a lot of help with either fixing their current setup or implementing new products they want to expand to, that is a great opportunity for you to be their strategic partner and set up a detailed [success plan](https://posthog.com/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/onboarding-success-plan) with them.
  - Some customers may not want to engage deeply and that is okay, still continue to monitor their usage/spend and check-in with them when appropriate. 
- You should have a regular check-in for all your customers, but the cadence (quarterly, monthly, weekly, biweekly) and medium (meeting or async) will depend on their needs.

### Already engaged with PostHog 

These customers already have established communication channels with PostHog, often through sales relationships.

#### Smooth handover process

- Review the [Sales > CSM Handover](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales/account-allocation#handing-over-customers) process
- Get introduced in their existing Slack/Teams channel or via email
- Coordinate with the previous point of contact to ensure continuity

## Next steps

Regardless of which category your customer falls into, make sure to spend the time understanding what they need and what your goals and approach will be for the relationship.

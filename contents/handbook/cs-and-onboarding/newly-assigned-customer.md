When you're assigned a new customer account, your approach will vary depending on their existing relationship with PostHog. This guide walks you through some key steps you can take when welcoming new customers to your book.

## Determine which category your customer falls into

### No/low interaction with PostHog humans

These are customers who have been using PostHog but haven't had much direct contact with our team. You should do a more thorough assessment before you have your first call with them. If you haven't done your initial outreach yet, you can also use the assessment to customize your message with a specific tip from your learning. 

#### Account and business audit

Start by gathering context about who they are and how they're using PostHog:

**Understanding their business:**
- What industry are they in? What products do they make?
- If you have other customers in their industry, does their usage of PostHog fit what you've seen before?
- For an even deeper dive on their business, the Sales team has a thorough [account planning template](/handbook/growth/sales/account-planning) that they use for cross-sell/expansion that you can take guidance from.

**Reviewing their PostHog setup:**
- What PostHog products are they using?
- What PostHog products are they *not* using?
- Does their setup look complete? Are they paying for products they don't use?
  - Going over the [customer deployment health check guide](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/health-checks) will help you answer these questions.
- Review their [product onboarding](/handbook/growth/sales/account-allocation#product-onboarding) status.

**Data management assessment:**
In their project(s), check the data management tab:
- Do they have custom events defined?
  - If not and they're using autocapture, have they defined [actions](/docs/data/actions)?
- Do custom events have relevant [properties](/docs/getting-started/send-events#sending-custom-properties-on-an-event) defined?
- If they're identifying persons or groups, have they defined a meaningful set of properties on those profiles?

Answering these questions helps you identify the most important things to focus on in your initial engagements.

#### Initial outreach

Once you've completed your audit:

- Find who are the owners/admins on the account and most active users.
- Review [saying hi to your customers](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/saying-hi-to-your-customers) for recommendations on how to do your outreach.

**Setting expectations:**
Once you've made contact, schedule a [discovery call](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/getting-to-know-your-customers#discovery-call) to better understand their goals and challenges.

Your discovery call should help you determine how the level of engagement you'll have with the customer going forward. Think through the following questions:
- What is the goal you want to achieve with this customer? (Keep an eye on them vs. become more deeply embedded as a strategic partner)
  - Do they need help fixing their current setup?
  - Do they have plans / interest in implement new PostHog products?
    - If the answer to either is yes, you can be their strategic partner and collaborate on setting up a detailed [success plan](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/onboarding-success-plan).
  - Some customers may not want to engage deeply and that is okay, still continue to monitor their usage/spend and check-in with them when appropriate. 

You should have a regular check-in for all your customers, but the cadence (quarterly, monthly, weekly, biweekly) and medium (meeting or async) will depend on their needs.

### Already engaged with PostHog 

These customers already have established communication channels with PostHog, often through sales relationships.

#### Smooth handover process

- Review the [Sales > CSM Handover](/handbook/growth/sales/account-allocation#handing-over-customers) process.
- Get introduced in their existing Slack/Teams channel or via email.
- Coordinate with the previous point of contact to ensure continuity.

## Next steps

Regardless of which category your customer falls into, make sure to spend the time understanding what they need and what your goals and approach will be for the relationship.

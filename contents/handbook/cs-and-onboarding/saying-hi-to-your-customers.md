Many customers have never spoken to PostHog – some happily welcome our help, others are strongly independent. In order to be a successful as a CSM, we want to understand our customers and be helpful.

[Get people to talk to you](/handbook/growth/sales/expansion-and-retention#1-get-people-to-talk-to-you) also has good helpful tactics.

# Introduce yourself

You likely won't have an established contact so introduce yourself to the widest blast range: org owner, org admin, users who have recently raised tickets, and users who have logged in in the last month. Even if there _seems_ to be a point of contact, things probably changed – multi-thread!

Your intro message should:

-   Introduce yourself as their new CSM
-   Describe value of CSM – dedicated point of contact, go-to person for help or questions, help customer use PostHog effectively e.g. through training or strategic guidance. Many customers misunderstand the CSM role as 'just support', so make sure to distinguish your role as CSM apart from that.
-   Value nugget: show how you can help by delivering value-add

### Examples of a value nugget

Take a look at your customer's account in Vitally and Metabase to identify ways you can be helpful. Some examples include:

-   Increase / decrease in events: make sure this is expected and things are implemented correctly
-   Recently opened a support ticket: follow up to make sure their issue is resolved
-   Concrete ways a customer can [optimize their spending](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/health-checks#are-they-paying-for-things-they-dont-need) or [improve their implementation](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/health-checks#have-they-implemented-tracking-incorrectly)
-   Invitation to a shared Slack channel so it's easier to connect with our team.
-   Lots of new users or low user engagement: offer a training session on how to use PostHog effectively
-   On a legacy pricing plan: "we've moved off legacy plan for more than a year and I'd like to transition you to standard pricing. Happy to discuss the changes"

If there's an established Slack channel you are inheriting, do it in Slack.

### Example subject lines:

You should find what you're comfortable with whilst keeping a sense of PostHog's tone of voice. Some examples include:

-   Hello 👋 from your new CSM at PostHog + hook
-   hi from PostHog
-   Checking in from PostHog

In Vitally, you can see how other team members have reached out to customers in the past by going to an account's Active conversations tab for inspiration.

If no response, follow up after 2-3 business days targeting folks in the product or data team. Emphasize the purpose of you reaching out - you're not trying to sell them something, you want to understand their use-case and help optimize their PostHog integration.

## Connect with champion

1-1 email or Slack message

Aim: start the relationship with a champion in product / data team

Content: acknowledge their time is valuable, that you will not be selling or pitching. You want to understand how to better serve the customer by understanding how they use PostHog. Would they be open for a 15 minute call? Offer to do this async as well.

## Mission start

Once you have a touch point with , your mission has started!

Aim: establish long term relationship, point of contact

Call structure:

1. Understand customer’s PostHog usage:
    1. What products are they using? How are they using it? What metrics do they care about from those products?
    2. What products are they **not** using? This has to be products that would make sense for them to use and you want to understand why they aren’t using it.
        1. For example, product analytics and web analytics are closely coupled. If customer is using product analytics but not web analytics, understand why. Is there a reason for that? What’s the objection?
2. Call out feature preview ✨
    1. Explain what feature preview is and how to enable them
    2. Recommend PostHog AI as it's usually relevant regardless of customer use case
    3. Otherwise, recommend new products that customer likely already has (e.g. Messaging, CRM) – position it as 'You probably already have [product], this is a product we’re trying to launch and would love to see how you would use it / any feedback you have. Keen to relay or rope in engineering team directly with your feedback.'
3. Q&A on product
4. Next steps and ideal catch up cadence.

# Customer Prioritization

-   Consider a separate approach for monthly and annual customers:
    -   Annual plans: prioritize accounts with contract renewals in the next 3-4 months
    -   Monthly plans: look for significant growth within the last quarter
-   Accounts with platform packages
    -   Customers on legacy "Teams" add-on ($450/month) could save $200 by switching to the "Boost" add-on if they do not require SAML SSO or managed reserve proxy. The teams add-on has now been split into:
        -   [Boost add-on](/platform-packages#boost-add-on) ($250/month)
        -   [Scale add-on](/platform-packages#scale-add-on) ($750/month)

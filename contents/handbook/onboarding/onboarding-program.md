We know how crucial the early stages of using PostHog can be. It's easy to configure PostHog poorly, pay for products you don't use (e.g., Groups, Autocapture), or generally misconfigure and not see a decent ROI.

Nothing is more reassuring than having a human to connect with and talk things through. One 30-minute call discussing the customer's architecture and providing suggestions can go a long way to preventing issues down the road, especially for more complex setups. Misconfiguration, especially for analytics/identity merging, is a known churn risk.

### Principles

Our onboarding program was created to offer necessary help, increase the value our customers get from PostHog, and assist them in achieving their business goals.

The program is guided by a few key principles:

- Help with initial configuration and billing, offer advice on usage.
- Assist customers with any technical questions they have around fitting PostHog into their stack.
- Act as strategic partners in achieving business goals.
- Adapt to varied levels of engagement while ensuring value for everyone.
- Encourage time spent in PostHog, trying things out. Adoption can be fun!
- Share best practices to leverage PostHog tailored to specific use cases.

### Structure

The current program spans over **8 weeks** and involves the following:

- **Initial outreach** - We audit the account and share observations on current usage and optimization tips. We point out any configuration issues affecting their bill or ability to use the product properly. Our main objective is oriented towards trimming unnecessary spending, and communicating our position that [we are the cheapest for every product](/why). This step can also involve refunding/adjusting bills for misconfigurations, per our [policy](/handbook/growth/sales/refunds).
- **First online meeting** - Hands-on implementation of optimization practices. During this call, we also offer the opportunity to schedule a second meeting if the customer is willing to dive deeper into any areas.
- **Second online meeting** - This is an optional meeting for customers interested in a deeper dive into using PostHog to achieve their business goals. After they share their initial goals or KPIs, we schedule a call. More team members are welcome!
- **PostHog homework** - Itâ€™s sent in the follow-up email to reinforce concepts we covered on the call.
- **Final outreach** - A last check to ensure usage and configuration are solid. We share additional educational resources and highlight where to find ongoing help. 

#### Timeline (approximate)

Our customers enter the segment at different points in their journey (e.g., credits roll off, projecting a first bill). Our goal is to reach out to them within the first week since they enter our segment, schedule the first call within the second/third week, schedule the second call within their fourth/fifth week, offer homework within the fifth/sixth week, and check in with them one more time on the seventh/eighth week.

We are very flexible with the engaged customers and would often extend the onboarding window to suit their needs. Ultimately, we want to ensure that they are onboarded and happy with the product.

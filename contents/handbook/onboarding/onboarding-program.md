Getting started with any new tool can be overwhelming, and PostHog is no exception. We want to make sure you're configured correctly, using the right features for your needs, and seeing real value.

That's why we offer personalized onboarding. Whether you need help with initial setup, want to optimize your billing, or are looking to align PostHog with your business goals, we're here to help.

### What to expect

Our onboarding program spans **8 weeks** and includes:

- **Account review and optimization tips** - We'll review your current setup and share recommendations to help you get the most value while minimizing costs.
- **First call (30 minutes)** - Let's get hands-on! We'll walk through optimization practices together and answer any technical questions about integrating PostHog into your stack.
- **Second call (30 minutes, optional but encouraged)** - Ready to go deeper? This follow-up call focuses on using PostHog to achieve your specific business goals and KPIs. Bring your team — the more, the merrier!
- **Final check-in** - We'll do one last review to make sure everything is working smoothly, share additional resources, and point you to ongoing support options.

### Timeline

Here's a typical timeline, though we're flexible and can adjust to your schedule:

- **Week 1**: Initial account review and outreach
- **Weeks 2-3**: First call scheduled
- **Weeks 4-6**: Second call (if requested)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Final check-in & onboarding graduation!


### Your success is our success


Here's the thing: most teams struggle with knowing *what* to track, not just *how* to track it. The first call gets you set up correctly. The second call is where the magic happens. We'll help you decide on the metrics that actually drive your business decisions and create a roadmap for using PostHog strategically.

This is where customers see the biggest ROI, and it's completely free. We highly encourage you to take advantage of it.

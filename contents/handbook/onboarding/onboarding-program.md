We know how crucial the early stages of using PostHog can be. Nothing is more reassuring than having a human to connect with and talk things through.

### Principles

Our onboarding program was created to offer necessary help, increase the value our customers get from PostHog, and assist them in achieving their business goals. 

The program is guided by a few key principles:

- Help with initial setup, configuration, and billing
- Offer advice on usage and provide clarity on billing
- Act as strategic partners in achieving business goals
- Adapt to varied levels of engagement while ensuring value for everyone
- Encourage time spent in PostHog, trying things out. Adoption can be fun!
- Share best practices to leverage PostHog tailored to specific use cases

### Structure

The current program spans over **8 weeks** and involves the following:

- **Initial outreach** - We share observations on current usage and optimization tips.
- **First online meeting** - Hands-on implementation of optimization practices.
- **Second online meeting** - This is an optional meeting for customers interested in a deeper dive into using PostHog to achieve their business goals. After receiving initial goals or KPIs, we schedule a call. More team members are welcome! 
- **PostHog homework** - Itâ€™s sent in the follow-up email to reinforce concepts we covered on the call.
- **Final outreach** - A last check to ensure usage and configuration are solid. We share additional educational resources and highlight where to find ongoing help.

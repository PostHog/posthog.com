## Your first few weeks

Welcome to the PostHog's Onboarding team! We only hire about 1 in 400 applicants, so you've done well to make it here! Unlike a lot of companies, we don't have a super-long onboarding process and would prefer you to be up and running with your customer base as quickly as possible. 

Here are the things you should focus on in your first few weeks at PostHog to help you achieve that. 

Ramping up is mostly self-serve - we won't sit you down in a room for training for 2 weeks. If you're not sure who is supposed to make something below happen, the person responsible is almost certainly you!

Also look at the [sales team's onboarding page](/handbook/growth/sales/new-hire-onboarding) for guidance on what _not_ to do when you start. In general, there's a lot of good resources within [sales](/handbook/growth/sales/overview) to reference (as we were previously one team!)

## Day 1

- Familiarize yourself with [how we work at PostHog](/handbook/company/culture).
- Meet with [Magda](/community/profiles/33065), who will run through this plan and answer any questions you may have. In addition, come equipped to talk about any nuances around how you prefer to work (e.g., schedules, family time, etc.).
- Setup relevant [tools](/handbook/growth/sales/sales-and-cs-tools) and check out [tools](https://posthog.com/handbook/onboarding/onboarding-team#tooling) specific for the Onboarding team.
  - Integrate Gmail with Salesforce and Vitally to enable centralized communication history
- If you start on a Monday, join your first PostHog All Hands (at 4.30 pm UK/8.30 am PT) and be prepared to have a strong opinion on whether pineapple belongs on pizza.
- If you start on a Monday, join your first Onboarding standup.
  - We fill in a GitHub issue every week before this meeting, so we are prepared for the discussion topics. Magda will add your GitHub handle to the template.
  - Book time with Magda to go over the nuts and bolts of the role - which leads get onboarding, what signals we're looking for, and how to reach out.

## Rest of week 1

 - Confirm that you have been added as a member to the [PostHog organization in GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog?view_as=member). [Fraser](/community/profiles/30207) can add you if you haven't.
 - Work your way through your GitHub onboarding issue that a member of the <SmallTeam slug="people" /> should have created and sent a link to.
 - Ask team members in your region to be invited to some customer calls so you can gain an understanding of how we work with customers.
 - Check out some [BuildBetter](https://app.buildbetter.app/) calls and add yourself to a bunch of Slack channels - get immersed in what our customers are saying.
   - There are a few BuildBetter playlists to start with – [customer training calls](https://app.buildbetter.app/folders/15381), [PostHog knowledge calls](https://app.buildbetter.app/folders/14593), [onboarding specialist calls](https://app.buildbetter.app/folders/14521), add to them as you listen! 
 - Learn and practice a [demo](https://youtu.be/2jQco8hEvTI) of PostHog.
   - For familiarization and self-led training, follow the [product curriculum](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/new-hire-onboarding#posthog-curriculum). You work through this with the [HogFlix Demo 3000 project](https://us.posthog.com/project/99423/dashboard), which is already populated with data. Alternatively, you can create a new [project](/docs/settings/projects) in either the [US](https://us.posthog.com/) or [EU](https://eu.posthog.com/) PostHog instances and [hook it up](/docs/getting-started/install) to your own app or [HogFlix instance](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-demo-3000).
 - Read all of the Onboarding section in the Handbook as well as the Sales and Customer Success section, and [update it as you learn more](/handbook/company/new-to-github#creating-a-pull-request).
 - Meet with [Charles](/community/profiles/28625), the exec responsible for customer-facing teams, and schedule monthly 1:1s with Simon.

## Week 2

- Shadow more live calls and listen to more [BuildBetter](https://app.buildbetter.app/) recordings.
- Explore Vitally and [Metabase](https://posthog.com/handbook/onboarding/metabase-account-analysis) – take note of any questions you have to go through during in-person onboarding.
- Try running through the [onboarding exercise](/handbook/cs-and-onboarding/new-hire-onboarding-exercise) that [Kaya](/community/profiles/34037) designed to test your skills for working with customer accounts.
- Towards the end of the week, schedule a demo and feedback session with Magda. We might need to do a couple of iterations over the next few weeks as you take on board feedback, don't worry if that's the case!
- Get comfortable with the PostHog [Docs](/docs) around our main products.
- Book time with Magda for a deep dive on PostHog billing, sales process/routing. This will help you understand how your role fits in the broader context of the customer-facing teams.
- We'll start routing new leads to you at the end of week 2. Start to review these and reach out, using a shared booking link with someone else from your region so they can back you up in the first few weeks. This is a great option to practice and fail.

## In-person onboarding

Ideally, this will happen in Week 2-3, with the company of a few colleagues (depending on where we do it and who's around). It will be 3-4 days covering (among others):

- Demo practice session with the team.
- The data we track on customers in PostHog and some hands-on exercises to get you comfortable using PostHog itself.
- Deep dive on Vitally and Metabase.
- Toolkit and internal processes.
- No stupid questions session.

Detailed training plan available in the [new hire onboarding checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DvZm6o3mBeSxwgMh2X8JAuXCLrOCS8sJAVLjC0K9VT8/edit?tab=t.0).

## Weeks 3-4

- You're already reaching out to our customer base.
- Focus on taking more and more ownership on calls so that team members are just there as a safety net.  
- Continue to meet with customers - very quickly, you should be doing these solo. The customers you are working with will mostly just be getting started, so you'll see a lot of very familiar patterns emerge.
- Make sure all your tooling is fully set up.
- Set up a call with [Daniel](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34722) to get a "soft intro" to Vitally playbooks, segments, and our internal metrics. It's not a deep-dive - just getting familiar.
- Keep working on your product knowledge. You can find a couple of [exercises here](https://posthog.com/handbook/onboarding/onboarding-team#how-to-deepen-your-knowledge).


## How do I know if I'm on track?

**By the end of month 1:**

 - Customers are happy after interacting with you, and you meaningfully contribute to their success.

### General expectations

Our customers are always central to our work. There’s time and space to work on fun projects, but that should never happen at the expense of our customers. Below are some non-exhaustive tips to help you stay on track during and after the probation period.

**Core responsibilities**

- Make sure you’re on top of our customer base in Vitally. Don’t let renewals fall through the cracks.
- It's not a race - quality over quantity, always. Spend time reviewing accounts, be accurate, and genuinely helpful in what you email to customers. 
- Listen to customers and respond to their needs. It’s a conversation, not a monologue with a set agenda. 
- Make sure your Calendly schedule stays available for customers. You’re the master of your own calendar, and we trust you, but be reasonable.
- Do the [Sales handoff](https://posthog.com/handbook/onboarding/sales-handover) where appropriate and always provide context on the customer.
- Maintain the hygiene - follow the process in Vitally, add notes, or tasks when necessary. Remember that we share the workspace, so keep the order.
- You’re the driver, so take initiative. Keep in mind improvements, optimization, process, or content updates as you go. Don’t be afraid to voice your ideas.

**Communication and ownership**

- Make sure you read the Handbook page on [Communication](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/communication). Always answer pings, even if it’s just to say “I’ll look into it later”. Emoji reactions can be helpful to indicate that you acknowledged or completed the task.
- Read the Handbook page on [Feedback](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/feedback)) Share and ask for feedback, take it with grace. Remember that it should be kind and factual, not based on assumptions.
- Publish your Sprint planning update on time. It should be done on Monday at the latest, so that others have time to read it before the Sprint planning call.
- Be yourself and stay human. Don’t send AI-generated emails to customers. 
- Set an autoresponder in your inbox whenever you take a longer time off, and direct your customers to `onboarding@posthog.com` so that we can pick up your conversations.
- Share your knowledge! Share what you learnt, or found out - the whole team will benefit from it.
- Don’t be late for calls. It’s rude, the same as eating on them. 
- Use the Time Off tool to communicate your absence in advance.
- Keep your promises. If you promised to follow up with a customer or colleague, or work on a project, do it.
- Stick to deadlines.

**Staying up to date**

Everything at PostHog changes really fast. That's how to keep up as a start:

- Follow #tell-posthog-anything daily for general announcements.
- Follow #cs-sales-support channel daily - it's crucial for all folks in customer-facing roles.
- Stay on top of the #incidents channel to know what’s going on and be able to inform customers.
- From time to time, it’s worth taking a look at #sales, #customer-success, #team-new-business-sales, #team-product-led-sales to get inspired by new ideas that other customer-facing folks implement, and what’s going on in general 
- #changelog channel to stay up to date with newly released products and features.
- #today-i-learnt set up by Daniel, great for sharing and learning new things.
- Attend All-hands calls, and if you skip them for any reason, catch up with the recording. It lets you stay on top of the new features we release and our direction.
- Set a Slack matcher for specific keywords (e.g, “onboarding referral” if you want to see leads we pass to Sales).
- Slack also has a cool AI Recap feature - it might be helpful.
- Don’t let your product knowledge get stale - check docs, use the product.

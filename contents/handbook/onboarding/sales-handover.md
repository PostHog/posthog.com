If you see that a customer is spending more than ~$1,667 monthly, conduct a discovery to understand the reason behind their high spend and assess whether there's potential for stable spend or usage moving forward. If they’re happy continuing with PostHog, you can mention our annual plan, which helps them save 20%. However, if they prefer paying monthly, they are more than welcome to do so!

We typically hand the account over to Sales when a customer is interested in the annual plan or requires additional contractual or legal support.

If you come across an account with growth potential or stable high-level spend (especially if that high spend has occurred over the past three months and there are no pending issues to resolve), that might benefit from an annual plan or general sales engagement but has been unresponsive after this option was suggested, you can add them to the “Create AE lead” segment in Vitally. Within a few minutes, this will automatically create a Salesforce lead and assign it using round-robin logic. Historically, AEs have been successful in reaching out and securing long-term commitments.

If the account has engaged with the Sales team at some point and it's unclear where the conversation stands, ping your fellow AE to make sure you’re not overlapping efforts. If it’s clear there’s a duplication issue and we shouldn’t be involved, ping Mine to double-check the logic.

Lastly, if you see an account with a promising, positive growth trajectory, but they may achieve the $ treshold after finish the onboarding program, set a task in Vitally in order to circle back after some time and see if they're eligible for being passed on to Sales.

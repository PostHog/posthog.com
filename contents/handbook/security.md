It is critical that everyone in the PostHog team follows these guidelines. We take people not following these rules very seriously - it can put the entire company and all of our users at risk if you do not.

## Password managers

You **must** make use of a password manager; it simply isn't possible to use appropriate passwords securely without one.

PostHog uses [1password](https://1password.com/) for storing all passwords.

## Password strength

Please use strong passwords for everything. Use the 1password password generator that comes with the app in all cases.

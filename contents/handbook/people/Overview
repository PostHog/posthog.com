Our primary goal is to make PostHog an incredible place to work by removing distractions from other small teams, and to keep PosHog running smoothly, without implementing lots of unnecessary processes. 

For PostHog to run smoothly, we want to keep growing the team by adding in world class talent to, new and existing, small teams. We want to do this whilst retaining our world-class team by making PostHog the most transparent company in the world, and the best place for people to work. 

Ops is like a hardware setup (Laptop, screen, keyboard etc), it provides all the tools, literally and metaphorically, needed for our engineers to come in and build their masterpieces. Practically, this looks like:- 

- A small team covering a wide range of disciplines, some in much greater depth than others, that can react to any incoming items to allow the rest of the business to focus on what they do best, building products.
- Nailing the basics of working at a start-up for our team members. Making sure things like payroll, onboarding, offboarding, all work smoothly and are on “auto-pilot” as much as possible.
- Thinking slightly further ahead than the “here and now" to predict when we may need to make changes like: hiring new team members, changing our spending patterns to save money, reward our team differently, implement a new tool etc. 
- Setting a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for the best people in their field, or people on their way to becoming exceptional at their jobs. This is so important to us, it's enshrined in our company values.
- Project managing compliance projects like SOC 2 or HIPAA, these will require input from some small team members but Ops will make sure everybody knows who and what is needed and avoid distraction.
- Partnering with the Exec team to work on people initiatives to build a diverse and inclusive culture at PostHog, reward our team & make things run smoother. We want to put a strong sense of belonging at the heart of everything we do. 

What Ops is not responsible for, that other Ops teams in other companies might be:- 

-Implementing centrally run HR processes to resolve issues. We trust managers to create an excellent working environment and the Exec team are responsible for any performance issues. 
-Booking travel or accommodation for when you travel. You should have the ability to do this yourself and we trust you will spend money carefully. The exception to this is our company off-site where we will book accommodation.
-Setting compensation
-Centralized Customer Support
-Company wide Goal-Setting
-Training 

##Ops team values

-Taking ownership 
-Supreme reliability
-Care & Compassion

##Taking Ownership

When something falls on the Ops team we make it very clear we are the owners of that specific thing. We communicate clearly with other teams when we require their input and we make it as easy as possible for them to help us achieve the desired outcome. We are quick to triage things that don’t have a clear owner and we get them into great shape before we expect others to have to interact with it. This could be anything from a compliance matter to how our merch process works. 

##Supreme Reliability

If Ops says they will take care of something, we take care of it. We are often trusted with big and small things and we take all of them seriously. We are trusted with a lot of sensitive information, from our team members personal details to specific company info that we need to protect. When people trust the Ops team with something, they know it’s getting done properly.

##Care & Compassion

The Ops team has got your back. We want to make sure we treat everybody with respect and we care deeply about the success of every team member and the success of the business. We always approach everything we do, making sure we will be proud of how we handled it. This doesn’t just count for our team members but for anybody interviewing, the customers we deal with and anybody else we interact with.

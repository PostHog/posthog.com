## Clubs at PostHog

All discussion around the below happens in the `#books-and-films` Slack channel.

**BookHog**

BookHog is PostHog's official book club. We meet once a month to discuss a particular book. Radical. 

Michael is the organizer and picks the next book to read through a pseudo-democratic process. All discussion and voting for the next book to read happens in the `#books-and-films` Slack channel. Previous books we have read include:

- A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology.
- Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder
- When Breath Becomes Air
- His Master's Voice
- The Order of Time
- Stories of Your Life and Others
- Soon I Will Be Invincible

Books can be purchased using your monthly [books budget](/handbook/people/training#books). 

**Big Questions Club**

Once a month, curious PostHog minds gather to discuss Big Questions. Example questions:

- Are we living in a simulation?
- Do we have free will?
- Will we ever fully simulate a human brain?
- Are we living in a multiverse?

Charles is the organizer and puts together a short reading and watch list in advance. At the beginning and end of each conversation, we vote on whether or not we agree or disagree with the proposition. Sometimes people's minds are changed. Often they are not.

The better you are at your job, the better PostHog is overall!

## Books

*Everyone* at PostHog is eligible to buy books to help you in your job.

The reason we think books can be more helpful than just Googling stuff, is that the level of quality has to be higher for them to get published.

You may buy a couple of books a month without asking for permission. As a general rule, spending up to \$40/month on books is fine and requires no extra permission.

Books do not have to be tied directly to your area, and they only need be loosely relevant to your work. For example, biographies of leaders can help a manager to learn, and can in fact be more valuable than a tactical book on management. Likewise, if you're an engineer, a book on design can also be particularly valuable for you to read.

## Training budget

We have an annual training budget for every team member, regardless of seniority. The budget can be used for relevant courses, training, formal qualifications, or attending conferences. You do not need approval to spend your budget, but you might want to speak to your manager first, in case they have some useful feedback or pointers to a better idea.

The training budget is \$1000 per calendar year, but this _isn't_ a hard limit - if you want to spend in excess of this, have a chat with your manager. Where the costs are higher than \$1000, please give Charles a heads-up, so he can increase your card limit. 

If possible, please share your learnings with the team afterwards!

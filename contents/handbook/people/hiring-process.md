This page will walk you through how we hire at PostHog. The goal is to have a lightweight process that optimizes for speed for the candidate, but above all for quality of the hire.

## Deciding to Hire

Every hire introduces complexity to the organisation and increases our burn rate. As a result, we think very careful about each new role, and we set an extremely high bar for the people that we do hire. 

See [our Strategy page](/handbook/strategy/strategy) to find out how we are thinking about which people we should be hiring, and when.

If we are hiring a role that we have less expertise in (e.g. a role we've never hired for before), it is worth getting an outside opinion on how to hire for this role before starting any of the below.

## Writing the spec

At the moment, we're not too worried about everyone on the team having really precisely defined job specs. PostHog is growing fast and job descriptions are changing rapidly so it's impossible to define a set list of tasks.

That being said, it is important that any job spec is written with your target audience in mind, in a clear and engaging way. There are several guides on how to this - [here is a good one](https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/how-to-write-a-good-job-description) - and you can also look at previous job ads to get a feel for how we communicate about PostHog. 

Once you have the job ad out there, don't be afraid to [iterate](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#iteration) and improve on it given the data! You shouldn't feel constrained by your initial spec if it isn't quite working, or if PostHog's needs have evolved since you first wrote it. 

## Building a Pipeline

We manage all of our candidates through [Breezy](https://app.breezy.hr) - please ask James or Tim for an invite. Make sure you track everyone through Breezy so we can ensure we provide all candidates with the best experience we possibly can - even if they are unsuccessful, they should come away feeling like they had a great interaction with PostHog. 

### Booking meetings

* Make sure you add a Zoom link that the people doing the interview are going to be able to open. If you are not going to be at the interview yourself, consider using Google Meet as it doesn't require a host. 
* Set an agenda for the meeting - this is to be welcoming to the candidate and to let the internal PostHog team member know what they need to cover in the meeting. The person who _books_ the meeting is responsible for setting the agenda.
* Forward the candidate's cover letter, LinkedIn, and other relevant resources to the relevant team members. This is easiest through [Breezy](https://app.breezy.hr).

The next section is an example agenda for the first stage. Make sure to insert the appropriate stage and links for the role. Keep the diversity message in as part of being inclusive to all candidates.

#### Example agenda

<blockquote>

Hey Mary,

Welcome to the first step of our hiring process. We're excited to meet you!

This is a cultural discussion, and it's to understand if we'd be setting each other up for success by working together.

Here is [a little info about the role](https://posthog.com/careers/designer).

We are a transparent by default company since [we value being open source](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values) - you can read our entire [handbook online](https://posthog.com/handbook). Here's a bit about [working at PostHog](https://posthog.com/careers). 

We're proud to be a group of [misfits](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity/). Diversity in our hiring matters greatly to us.

We look forward to speaking with you, and please do reach out if you have any questions in advance of our conversation.

Thanks,

Charles

### Where to find great candidates

#### Direct outreach

Outreach has a few advantages:

* We can approach people with very specific or relevant experience
* It allows us to encourage candidates from a wider range of backgrounds to apply 

It is possible to research a list of potential candidates through:

* Twitter
* LinkedIn - [Boolean searches](https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/306/boolean-search-a-simple-guide-for-recruiters) are your friend!
* Behance
* Dribble

It is important before starting outreach like this that you consider *why* a candidate messaged through this approach would move to us, so that your note to them can explain why you felt it might be a nice fit. 

#### Referrals

* From our own team
* From our investors
* From the PostHog community (the users Slack Group, and posting on our social media profiles for our followers to see)
* From the YC community (Slack / WhatsApp / Forum)

#### Job boards

#### Design

We are learning which boards work well:

- [Behance](https://www.behance.net/adobetalent)
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/jobs/new)

#### Engineering

- HackerNews Who's Hiring
    - Tend to get high quality candidates, and people interested in working at startups. 
    - See [Tim's comment history](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=timgl) for a template.
- [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/)
    - Paid, but helps us achieve a more diverse group of candidates.
- [AngelList](https://angel.co)
    - We found Eric through there. Higher quality than RemoteOK and pretty high volume.
- [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io/)
    - High volume of candidates, but much lower quality.

#### General

- Since PostHog is a YC company, we can place job ads in YC's [Work at a Startup list](https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs).

## Our Hiring Process

The stages of our hiring process are:

- Application
- Culture interview with James
- Technical interview with the hiring team 
   - this is usually Tim and 1 or more PostHog team members interviewing the candidate at the same time who would work closely with the candidate day-to-day
   - decide if we will do a SuperDay, else give feedback
- PostHog SuperDay
- Offer

We track the stage the candidate is at [in Breezy](https://app.breezy.hr).

There may be an additional interview where we bring in a 3rd party with specialist expertise in the case of hiring roles that we've not hired for before.

### Application

Read applications and resumes carefully. 

If a candidate hasn't customized the application or resume to the role, it is a flag they're aren't that excited about working at PostHog. It is understandable why people don't do this, but at an interview stage, it's important to note how passionate they seem about the company. Did they try out the software already? Did they read the handbook? Are they in our community Slack?

Candidates who are unsuccessful at this stage should receive automated feedback, unless they personalised their application in which case a short email is appropriate.

#### Engineering

We hire repeatedly into engineering roles, so here are a few things we look for:

- Experience with relevant technologies (Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus)
- Has started a project from scratch, without outside help
    - Usually this manifests as having been the founder of a startup, or building an impressive side project. It can also be shown through a big project in the day job, but that requires a bit more digging.
- Communication. Do they have spelling errors in their cover letter? What does their online presence look like?
    - More so than other companies, all of our communication is written and public for the world to see. Good written communication is key.

### Interview 1 - Culture with James

We start with an interview which is designed to get the overall picture on what a candidate is looking for, and to explain who we are.

This is to allow both PostHog and the candidate to assess cultural fit, and to dig into any areas of potential misalignment based on the application. We are looking for proactivity, directness, strong communication, an awareness of the impact of the candidate's work, and evidence of iteration / a growth mindset.

- Talk about PostHog, where we're at and what the future looks like, including our long-term vision. If it was cold outreach, we provide a little more context up front.
- Talk about the candidate, dig into any questions I have from their CV
- Talk about the hiring process and check if the candidate has seen our compensation calculator so we know we're roughly aligned

Candidates who are unsuccessful at this stage should receive a personalised email with feedback. 

### Interview 2 - Technical

The second step is the technical interview. This is usually 2 PostHog team members spending an hour with the candidate (at the same time).

These interviews will focus on the skills needed to fill the role. 

For a design hire, questions could be:
- A walk through of an example website page, product or other 
- Tell me about one of the pieces in your portfolio
- What does your calendar look like on a day you'd really look forward to - what sort of tasks would be on it?
- How do you educate yourself on design?

For an engineering hire, this would be things like:
- Tell me about a project you started from scratch.
- What was the hardest technical thing you've done in the last month?
- What did you do on your very best day at work?
- Tell me about a project that you led that failed. Why did it fail and what did you learn?

[Here are some more ideas](https://firstround.com/review/40-favorite-interview-questions-from-some-of-the-sharpest-folks-we-know/) for great questions to ask candidates. Try to keep the basic structure of your questions consistent, as this makes it easier to compare candidates to each other.

One of the two technical interviewers will lead the discussion. The reason for 2 people is to ensure a deeper, higher quality interview.  

The person interviewing outside their area of expertise is the bar-raiser. The bar-raiser is here to qualify that everyone is truly excited about the candidate and that they're an example of us believing in talent compounds. Everyone should still think this way - or they should be clear in why they don't feel like this as part of their feedback.

As a rule of thumb, everyone interviewing must feel a genuine sense of excitement about working with the candidate. If it is not a _definite yes_, then it's a _no_. 

Candidates who are unsuccessful at this stage should receive a personalised email with feedback. 

### PostHog SuperDay

We offer those who have gotten through the interview process the chance to do a paid PostHog SuperDay. We schedule 1 full day in advance with the candidate where we hire them as a contractor.

This gives the candidate a chance to learn how we work, and for us to see the quality, speed and communication of the candidate. It is a very demanding day of work.

We will pay the candidate their 'normal day rate.' If they have done contracting before they will have one, but if not you can use [this formula](https://www.ellwoodatfield.com/event/how-to-calculate-out-your-day-rate/) to calculate it.

This day will be _the same_ task each time for a given role, to be shared with the candidate at the start of the day. It should be _too much_ work for one person to complete in a day, in order to get a sense of the person's ability to prioritize. The tasks should be as close as possible to those that the candidate would be working on every day.

### Decide if we will hire

There will be a written catchup over Slack or via Zoom about the candidate with all people involved during the hiring. A yes/no decision will be made and then communicated to the candidate.

It is expected that everyone takes notes on every interview and brings these to the meeting. These should _not_ be shared in advance of subsequent interviews but feel free to ask the next interviewer to dig into a certain area when you wished you had asked something.

In case of a rejection, it's important to clearly outline why that decision was made. Highlight what went well, but also mention specific points of improvement. Offer to schedule a call if they would like to discuss further. Make sure to leave the door open for the future so they can apply again in 12-18 months time as circumstances and people change.

If there are wildly different opinions, reflect on why.

### Making the hire

Hooray!

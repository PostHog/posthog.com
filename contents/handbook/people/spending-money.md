There are many occasions when you will need to spend company money. PostHog is a lean organization - the less we spend, the more time we have to make sure the company takes off. However, it is more important you are productive, healthy, and happy.

## Philosophy & guiding principles 📙💭
PostHog operates on a context-based expense policy [inspired by the book 'No Rules Rules'](https://posthog.com/handbook/story#things-that-influenced-us). We're empowering team members to make good decisions while maintaining transparency and accountability.

Ask yourself:
- Can you clearly explain why this expense is in PostHog's best interest?
- Would you be comfortable explaining this expense to the entire team publicly?

If the answer is **yes**, it is likely the expense is in the best interest of the company and supports your productivity.

**If not, think again**.

**The goal here is to empower you. However, when in doubt, ask your team lead for context, not permission.** 
- Still in doubt? Ask [Janani](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34497) in [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C017WDX3BFZ).


## How it works 🏭
- All company expenses (offsites, software/tool subscriptions, merch, etc.) will have common company-wide budgets.
- You'll be assigned a single 'User Limit' of $5,000 per month from which you can spend money on individual subscriptions, coworking/collaboration, equipment (except laptop and studio monitor - ping #team-people-and-ops for this), training, etc. If you need an increase in the limit, request it on Brex.

### Transparency & accountability 🧑‍🏫
- All **expenses are visible company-wide**: we believe transparency drives better decision-making.
- **Accountability**: If we have questions about an expense or need documentation, we'll reach out for clarification.
- **Team lead oversight**: Monthly reports showing all direct report expenses.


## Logistics ⚙️
### UK employees
Use your Revolut if
 - the expense is over £75, _and_
 - has UK VAT on it.

If not, use your Brex.

Why? The company can claim back VAT on these larger purchases - the more money we claim back, the more money we have to #DoMoreWeird

Please make sure that the invoice is addressed to Hiberly and its registered address (this can be found in the company information sheet).

### Receipts 🧾
All expenses over $75 or £75 must have itemized receipts attached and memo updated within 14 days of the charge (required for audit documentation).
- Brex
  - upload the itemized receipt using the [Brex app, text, email or Slack](https://www.brex.com/support/receipts-for-expenses#attaching-receipts-to-a-specific-expense)
  - update the memo using the [Brex app, text, email or Slack](https://www.brex.com/support/memos-for-expenses#add-a-memo-to-a-single-expense)
- Revolut: email your itemized receipts to [ukinvoices@posthog.com](mailto:ukinvoices@posthog.com) along with a memo in the body of the email

Expenses with no receipts above $75 or £75 may be deducted from your pay if we can't verify the business purpose - this is mainly for repeat issues where someone's clearly ignoring the policy.

**We need an _itemized receipt/invoices_ (for example, the full booking confirmation email PDF for flights/hotels, detailed bill from the restaurant for a team dinner) - because Brex auto-verifies these using the information on the file.**
- Please do not upload cropped images that show just the amount or just the credit card machine confirmation slip - without context, the receipt is pointless.
- Similarly, our UK accountants review the expenses and determine our tax compliance, which isn't possible without a detailed receipt/invoice.

> Template for a thorough memo
>  - What: [item/service purchased]
>  - Why: [business reason - how this helps PostHog/your work]
>  - Context: [relevant details - who attended, what project, etc.]


## Expense review 🔎
Finance reviews:
- All expenses over $1000 (Brex),
- Random sampling of expenses under $1000 (Brex),
- All Revolut expenses.

_We may adjust these thresholds depending on bandwidth in the team._

#### Team Leads
You'll get monthly expense reports for your direct reports. You have context Finance doesn't, which will help justify spending decisions to the auditors. **How much you dig into these is up to you - the goal is catching patterns, not micromanaging.**


### Why documentation matters 🏦
- Missing receipts and memos create extra work during audit season - auditors will need to dig into those expenses, which means hours of back-and-forth with you about charges from several months ago! A quick receipt upload and memo update now saves everyone time later.
- Additionally, we're legally prohibited from paying personal expenses on behalf of team members.
- Beyond the audit hassle, poor expense documentation can:
  - Put PostHog at risk of tax penalties/fines,
  - Create awkward conversations in investor discussions,
  - Force us into a rigid pre-approval expense system (nobody wants this!!)

> The flexible, trust-based policy we have only works when everyone maintains proper documentation. If team members consistently fail to upload receipts and add memos, we'll either need to implement rigid pre-approvals for all spending, or treat repeated violations as performance management issues.


## Budget structure on Brex 💳
We're not going to police your spending with hard limits but we will continue to use budgets and limits on Brex because:
- **Audit**: maintaining budgets and limits help with proper categorization and tracking of expenses by department and function. Without this, financial reporting for audits becomes a manual nightmare.
- **Financial Reporting**: accurate categorization of expenses is essential for Board reporting, tax compliance, and to track actual spend against budgets.

Think of these budgets as organizational tools, not spending restrictions:
- Offsite budgets - managed by [Kendal](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/28628):
  - Whole company offsite
  - Mixed team offsites
  - Small team offsites
  - Onboardings
- Company software budget: all subscriptions/tools for the company ([Janani](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34497) will be taking over as billing admin for company software subscriptions)
- User Limit of $5,000 per month, per user: co-working/collaboration costs, training, individual software subscription, etc.
  - For subscriptions and other recurring monthly expenses, we recommend using the virtual card under your User Limit to ensure it gets categorized to the correct budget by default

Joining an offsite? Only use the offsite budget, not your User Limit - it helps the People & Ops track travel spend accurately against budgets. Let Kendal know in [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C017WDX3BFZ).

## Addressing policy issues 👮
#### Inappropriate spend
- Audit compliance: Expenses that could be construed as personal will be flagged as non-business expenses by auditors,
- If you pay for a personal expense using the company card, it would constitute a taxable benefit to you. The People & Ops team does not have the bandwidth to handle the admin burden.

So, you may not use your Brex or Revolut for personal expenses.

#### Examples of inappropriate spend
- Personal expenses during business travel (for example: gym sessions/fitness classes, groceries)
- Entertainment subscriptions for personal use (for example: Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)
- Expenses that benefit you personally rather than the business
- Anything you wouldn't feel comfortable explaining publicly

_This list will be updated based on common questions/scenarios._

#### Consequences
- Misunderstanding: you genuinely thought an expense was in PostHog’s best interest, but we disagree - we’ll provide clarification and context,
- Intentional violation: knowingly and willingly spending money in ways not in PostHog’s best interest or to intentionally circumvent the guidelines will result in the individual being terminated for cause.
  - Continual misuse (multiple transactions flagged frequently) will be treated like policy violation and result in termination for cause.

#### Team lead responsibilities
- We recommend Team Leads review direct report expenses monthly/quarterly to assess if they’re in the best interest of the business. This helps in maintaining oversight over expenses, and approaches the review with appropriate context (Finance won’t always have the best context), which will be important during audits.
- Address concerning patterns promptly.
- Lead by example with transparent spending and context-setting.


## Expense guidelines 🛠
### Equipment
#### Laptop & Monitor
Coordinate with [Tara](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34526) who handles most Macbook and Apple Studio Display purchases - ping her on [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C017WDX3BFZ)
  - Having equipment purchases centralized helps ensure accurate accounting and tracking of fixed assets for the audit.
  - We expect you to ship the Macbook and Apple Studio Display back when you leave PostHog.
  - Apple Studio Displays are only allowed for Product Engineers (high density screen) and Sales (in-built high quality webcam and microphone) teams
  - Guidelines
    - For engineering roles (product & support), we recommend a Macbook Pro 14-inch M4 Pro, with the 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU upgrade and 64GB of RAM. We recommend the 1TB SSD drive in order to make sure you have enough space to run the full stack locally.
    - For sales roles, we recommend a Macbook Pro 14-inch M4, with 10-core GPU, 16-core and the 32GB RAM upgrade. Again, grab the smallest SSD (512gb)
    - All other roles, we currently recommend a Macbook Air with the latest Apple Silicon processor and 16GB of RAM.
    - Apple offers multiple screen sizes. The larger screen sizes (15 inches +), are disproportionately more expensive. If you are realistically going to do most of your work at home, it is more rational to pick a smaller laptop size, and to get a large (27 inch) monitor.
    - We only purchase laptops with an English keyboard configuration (US, International or British is fine) - this enables us to easily pass your laptop on to someone else if you upgrade or leave.
    - In the exceptional circumstance that you need to purchase your own laptop,
      - Check if Amazon has sales before purchasing through Apple,
      - US only: use your Brex since we earn cashback,
      - UK only: use your Revolut since we claim back the VAT,
      - Do not get Apple care since it doesn't have great value for money.
    - You can request a new laptop if your laptop is over 4 years old or significantly impacting your productivity. We do ask that you do some diligence to make sure it's not a setup issue though - ie other applications aren't hogging the memory, etc.
    - Part of the Client Libraries team and need to purchase a new phone? Coordinate with [Tara](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34526).

#### Yubikey
We enforce the use of hardware security keys wherever we can. Every team member needs two Yubikeys. You can find them on Amazon, and can read more about security keys in the [multi-factor authentication entry](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/security#multi-factor-authentication).

#### Other equipment
- Keyboard/mouse/laptop stand: Check Amazon and Apple for discounts. Refurbished items would work just fine. [Nextstand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NEXSTAND-K2-Adjustable-Foldable-Portable/dp/B01HHYQBB8) make great value laptop stands that are portable.
- Desk & Chair - again, refurbished is fine. If you live in the UK, [Office Resale](https://www.officeresale.co.uk/) offer a range of like-new refurbished designer furniture, which you might find better value.

### Software
We are _strongly opposed_ to introducing new software that is designed for collaboration by default. There needs to be a very significant upside to introducing a new piece of software to outweigh its cost.

The cost of introducing new collaborative software is that it creates another place where todo items / comments / communication can exist. This creates a disproportionate amount of complexity.

Our entire stack for collaborative software is pleasingly simple:
- Google Sheets - spreadsheets
- GitHub - documents, code, discussion
- Slack (premium) - chat (although we encourage you to default into discussion of features/strategy etc into GitHub)
- PostHog - product analytics
- Figma - design

Individual software is down to your personal preference, and we encourage you to share cool software.
- There are some tools used by team members individually - if they become more widely adopted, it makes sense to have a company account. Reach out to [Tara](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/34526) on [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C017WDX3BFZ)
- Ask for access in [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C017WDX3BFZ) to get access to:
  - [Loom](https://www.loom.com): you'll be added as a _Creator Lite_ which allows you to record 25 videos/mo at up to 5 minutes in length. Should you need a full Creator account (unlimited videos, advanced features), ask [Mine](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/29862) or [Simon](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/28895).
  - [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us): we use Google Meet by default, but you can use Zoom for free (up to 40-minute calls). Should you need longer meetings, ask [Simon](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/28895). (But does anyone _really_ need longer meetings?)
  - [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com): everyone has their own favorite email app, but Superhuman users will make sure you don’t forget theirs. We have a team plan to keep those folks happy with inbox zero and inner peace.
  - [Granola](https://granola.ai): It’s absolutely okay to use AI note-takers so you can stay engaged in meetings without writing everything down. Feel free to choose your own but please be aware of who the sub-processors are to ensure they do not use a competitor for analytics.
- IDEs: Visual Studio, VIM and PyCharm are the most popular within our team. IDEs range widely in cost; best in class IDE suites can cost up to $700, which is not a great value proposition for most engineers.


### Sponsorships
If you believe an open-source project is fundamentally important to the success of PostHog then we should set up a recurring sponsorship. In this case, see the [open-source sponsorship Marketing initiative](/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship).

To enable individuals to support projects on an ad-hoc basis, we use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/).

To get setup with Open Collective get in touch with [Charles](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/28625) who will add you to the [PostHog Open Collective team](https://opencollective.com/posthog). From there, you'll be able to make "contributions" (sponsor a project) as the PostHog organization via Open Collective. For more information see the [Open Collective payments documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments).

_If you find a project that only supports [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors), please ask Charles to set up the sponsorship._ 

### Travel
- We travel in economy by default and do not pay for business class
  - If you're unsure of your travel plans and believe you may have to cancel, it may be worth spending a bit extra to book flex tickets that allow a full refund to your Brex
  - It may be worth occasionally upgrading to Premium Economy if you're travelling a lot for work and the cost is not unreasonably high, particularly if you're working the next day
- Consider signing up for programs like Global Entry if you are regularly traveling to countries that offer it, using your Brex; this saves you time, particularly when traveling to the US.
- When traveling internationally, use your Brex to expense a reasonable eSIM. PostHog does not cover roaming charges for your phone.
- When using your Brex internationally, use the local currency since Brex generally offers a better exchange rate.
- PostHog has international insurance for our work trips, so do not buy travel insurance when traveling on behalf of PostHog.
- It's fine to book your outbound / return flights for a different day to when you are required to be there as long as the flight is a similar price or less.
 - Any other costs outside of the days you are required to be at an event are of course _not_ covered.
> If you find yourself needing to do extra travel outside of the regular things listed above, e.g. you've been asked to take a last minute trip to work on an emergency project, we may pay for a nicer seat here, especially if you are traveling at very short notice or long haul. Ask on [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C017WDX3BFZ) if you think this may apply to you. This is intended for genuine one-offs, not where you've decided you'd like to come along to an extra offsite!
- We strongly encourage team members to try and work together in person when practical. This isn't limited to just working with people in your team, but we expect that you have a reasonable reason you need to work together.
- If you're in the same place as other team members, even if you aren't directly working together, PostHog will cover the cost of a dinner or a fun activity
- If you are meeting a user for an interview or a potential customer, we would encourage you to pick up the bill. At PostHog's current stage, a fancy coffee shop is encouraged. A fancy lunch or dinner is not.

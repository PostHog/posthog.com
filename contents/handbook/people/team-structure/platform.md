##Â Scope
In Scope
  * Deploying and managing Posthog (Cloud + Self-hosted)
  * Scaling posthog (Cloud + Self-hosted)
  * Infrastructure for data migrations (for ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Kafka,...)
  * Ingestion, libraries and plugins (contentious)

Out of Scope
  * Developer Experience
  * Expanding the plugins library

## How we work?
* Pairing at least two people on one goal/project - not having a single person alone working on a goal
* The board should be our source of truth
* We document what we do to share context internally
* We finish what we start, or we don't start it at all
* We continually prioritize
* We prioritize ublocking others
* We have an agenda and follow up on actions from our meetings
* Be frugal

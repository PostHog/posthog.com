## Mission

Make using and developing for PostHog as reliable as running water. Wherever you want it.

## Goals 

- We don't lose events
- Data is as up to date as possible
- Engineers always are able to ship and build
- Fail fast. Fix faster.
- Ship anywhere
- Infrastructure scales with demand
- Enable developers to extend PostHog as a Platform
- Support Small Teams (and contributors) in building and debugging PostHog
- Be frugal.

## Responsibilities
Concrete things we take responsibility over:

- [app.posthog.com](https://app.posthog.com) and its infrastructure
- On Prem & Single Tenant deployments
- CI/CD - How we deploy
- Data infrastructure (ClickHouse, Kafka)
- Monitoring and Alerting stack
- Event ingestion
- Extensibility: Plugin server, plugins, and libraries

## Customer

- Other Small Teams in making sure they have the tools (databases, queues, etc) and the ability to deploy effortlessly that they need to build
- Self deployed teams
- app.posthog.com users

## Metrics

- Primary: Install conversion rate (Number of attempted installs / successful installs)

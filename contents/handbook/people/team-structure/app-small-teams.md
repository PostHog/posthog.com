Product Small Teams are particular types of Small Teams that own an area of the product.

## What does owning an area of the product mean?

The product small team is responsible for everything related to that area of the product including:

1. Usage
2. Quality
3. Revenue

## What actions should the product small teams be doing for their area?

- Each quarter:
  1. Create good quarterly OKRs
  2. Create an ambitious vision for their area
- During the quarter:
  1. Maintain a prioritized roadmap to help them achieve their objectives
  2. Speak to customers
  3. Monitor relevant metrics including those covering Usage, Quality and Revenue
  4. Triage and fix related bugs
  5. Assist the support hero in answering related questions
  6. Collaborate with marketing

## What is the role of the team lead?

The team lead is overall responsible for ensuring the above happens. They should focus on enabling the team to solve these tasks together rather than trying to do it all themself.

## What do the product managers do?

With our engineering-led culture, the engineers on the product small team are responsible for the product. 

We have a small number of product managers who support the product small teams in achieving their goals. This includes a wide range of activities such as helping with prioritization, setting up dashboards, competitors analysis, speaking to customers etc.

However, having product managers doesn't mean that the engineers can outsourcing speaking to customers or diving into metrics. The engineers should be the experts of the product they are building and their customers.

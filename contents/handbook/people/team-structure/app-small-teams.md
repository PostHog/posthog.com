  2. Speak to customers

## What is the role of the team lead?

The team lead should led the team to make sure the above happens. They should get the team fully involved rather that doing everything themselves.

## What do the product managers do?

With our engineering-led culture, the engineers on the app small team are responsible for the product. 

We have a small number of product managers who support the app small teams in achieving their goals. This includes a wide range of activities such as helping with prioritization, setting up dashboards, competitors analysis, speaking to customers etc.

However, having product managers doesn't mean that the engineers can outsourcing speaking to customers or diving into metrics. The engineers should be the experts of the product they are building and their customers.

## Mission

Makers everywhere get better at building products because of PostHog

## Q3 2022 Goals
* **Objective 1:**
    * Increase the number of successful organizations on PostHog
* **Key Results:**
    * Increase in [retention](https://app.posthog.com/insights/bj3-djOy): week 4 retention from the previous week goes from 21.5% to 30%.
* **Rationale:**
    * To nail self-serve we need every new organization that signs up to have a smooth and easy experience, from ingesting their first event to understanding how to use product analytics to inviting their team to share insights

* **Objective 2:**
    * Make it **easy to build** new features quickly that fit in with our design system.
* **Key Results:**
    * 50% reduction in custom and inline CSS styles. Exact metric TBD.

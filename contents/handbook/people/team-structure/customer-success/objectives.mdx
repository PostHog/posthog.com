* **Proposed Objective:**
    * Minimize time to revenue
* **Proposed Key Results:**
    * Add 3 x 20-70k customers a week (new or increased usage)
    * Do not churn any customers with 20-70k spend whoâ€™ve previously paid in this range (from dips out of this range or cancellations)
    * We track the ideal customer profile against every sign up and prioritize based on this
* **Rationale:**
    * We need to get the company excited about Ideal Customer Profile customers, not just big ones.

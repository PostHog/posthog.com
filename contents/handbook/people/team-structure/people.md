- [Charles Cook](/handbook/people/team#charles-cook-business-operations), VP Ops

## Mission

Make PostHog _the_ most transparent company in the world, and the best place for people to work. Our goal is to create a world-class remote company by enabling our team to (a) maximize their impact and performance, (b) growth personally and professionally and (c) have a strong sense of purpose and belonging.

## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people operations and culture. This is what we care about:

- [Talent compounds](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#talent-compounds) - we have a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for _the_ best people in their field, or people on their way to become exceptional at their jobs. We optimize for building high-performing teams, while delivering a great experience to everyone involved.
- We support our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from making an offer, to onboarding and career development, to parental leave and eventually parting ways. 
- We create light-touch initiatives and processes that allow PostHog to act fast (while complying with local legislation) and [iterate](/handbook/company/culture#iteration) continuously. These include performance reviews, progression frameworks, compensation reviews and many more.
- Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) with a strong sense of belonging is at the heart of everything we do. It's so important to us, we built a dedicated [handbook page](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity). In the people team, we also live and breathe our culture and values, and constantly work to make PostHog an even better place to work.

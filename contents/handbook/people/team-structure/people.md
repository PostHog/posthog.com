## People & Ops

- Charles Cook, VP Ops & Marketing
- Grace McKenzie, Operations Manager
- Coua Phang, Tech Talent Partner

## Mission

Our primary goal is to build and retain our world-class team. We will accomplish this by making PostHog _the_ most transparent company in the world, and the best place for people to work. Once on board, our goal is to enable our team to: 

1. Maximize their impact and performance
2. Grow personally and professionally
3. Have a strong sense of purpose and belonging

## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people, operations, and culture. This is what we care about:

- Setting a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for _the_ best people in their field, or people on their way to becoming exceptional at their jobs. This is so important to us, it's enshrined in our [values](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#talent-compounds).
- Supporting our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from [making an offer](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation), to [onboarding](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/onboarding) and [career development](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/feedback), [parental leave](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/time-off), and eventually [parting ways](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation). 
- We create light-touch initiatives, systems, and processes that allow PostHog to act fast and [scale iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration) 
- Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) with a strong sense of belonging is at the heart of everything we do. It's so important to us, we have a dedicated [handbook page](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity).

## Customer

## Tools

An operations team is never complete without a robust toolkit to allow us to automate processes and multiply our impact. Here is a summary of some of the tools we've found most effective for getting the job done. You can read more about them [here](https://posthog.com/blog/startup-ops-toolkit).

### Hiring

**Contracts & Offer Letters**

Do _not_ pay a lawyer to create contract templates for you. Orrick has a set of [free templates](https://www.orrick.com/en/Total-Access/Tool-Kit/Start-Up-Forms/Employment-and-Consultant) you can use.

Consider using an e-signature platform like [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com/) to avoid emailing PDFs back and forth forever.

**HR, Recruiting, and Payroll**

[Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/) is the industry standard for managing and paying US-based employees.

If you're hiring abroad, or hiring contractors, consider using [Deel](https://www.letsdeel.com/).

If you are hiring in multiple states, you'll need to register and most likely pay taxes. Avoid this massive headache and use [Middesk](https://www.middesk.com/).

For managing employee information and time-off requests for a globally-distributed team, we use [CharlieHR](https://www.charliehr.com/).

If you're managing a large candidate pipeline, an ATS (Applicant Tracking Software) is a must. We use [Workable](https://www.workable.com)

**Finance and Banking**

Unless you _really_ love Quickbooks, you should outsource this. For the US, we use [Fondo](https://www.tryfondo.com/), who are absolutely fantastic.

For banking, credit cards, and expense management, look no further than [Brex](https://www.brex.com/). They are designed for start-ups and use your capitalization to grant significantly larger credit limits than traditional banks.

For financial planning, headcount planning, and forecasting, check out [Pry](http://pry.co/) who were recently acquired by Brex.

To manage our cap table, including options grants and exercises, we use [LTSE Equity](https://equity.ltse.com/) who also offer 409a valuation services.

**Everything Else**

For those pesky externalities, we use [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/) for all of our insurance coverage.

A bit unusual for an operations team, we track everything in [GitHub](https://github.com/) from maintaining this handbook to sprint planning. You can find the People & Ops project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/2?fullscreen=true). 

And finally, if you're in the 0.0001% of startups using Teams or email (!) for internal communications, just switch to [Slack](https://slack.com/) already.

_Do you have recommendations for tools not listed here (we're especially seeking some for goal-setting and performance review management), or upgrades to any of the above? Raise an issue below and let us know!_

## Mission

Make PostHog the best place everyone here has ever worked. Our goal is to create a world-class (remote) culture, prioritising impact, autonomy and personal development.

## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people operations and culture:

- Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) is at the heart of everything we do. 
- We support our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from making an offer, to onboarding and career development, to parental leave and eventually parting ways. 
- We create light-touch initiatives and processes that allow PostHog to act fast (while complying with local legislation) and [iterate](/handbook/company/culture#iteration) continuously. 
- In the people team, we live and breathe our [culture](/handbook/company/culture) and [values](/handbook/company/values), and constantly work to make PostHog an even better place to work.

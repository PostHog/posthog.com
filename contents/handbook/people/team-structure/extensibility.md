## Mission

Team Extensibility's job is to turn PostHog into a platform that everyone can integrate with.

## Responsibilities

Team Extensibility is responsible for:

- Maintaining and improving the plugin server

## Priorities

- Priority nr 1: making sure there are no cracks in the walls and that we always keep in mind safety, security, and data 
  integrity of our systems. We code defensively, prefer allowlists to denylists, always have at least 2 people review
  any piece of code, etc.
- Priority nr 2: an absolutely fabulous user experience. Connecting things to PostHog either via plugins or integrations
  should spark joy.

## Customer

- People using our various integration libraries

## Output metric

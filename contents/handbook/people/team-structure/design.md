> Looking for our brand style guide? [Look no further.](/handbook/company/branding)

Design is a quasi-team, with our members spread between other Small Teams. Like sovereign states have ambassadors, our designers live on the ground in the places where we can tangibly offer support.

While most of our time is spend embedded in other Small Teams, we come together weekly to discuss goals, prioritize tasks, maintain brand cohesion between products, and ponder the future visual language across the company.

## Have a design request?

[Learn how to request assistance from Team Design](/handbook/company/working-with-design)

TL;DR: If your team doesn't have a dedicated designer, create an Issue and add it to the Design project. Your issue doesn’t have to be isolated to the design request, but you should include the following details in the Issue so we can prioritize accordingly:

1. What do you need designed and why?
2. What is the deadline?

If there isn’t a clear deadline for your design request, we’ll prioritize according to our availability.


## Our process

Design tasks are managed on our org-wide *Design board*. This aggregates tasks across our GitHub repos, and makes it easy to request Team Design’s involvement in your project.

At the very least, we review new issues awaiting triage every Monday. If you have a request that’s more urgent, ping a team member in the relevant Slack channel for your project (eg: #team-website or #team-core-experience) with a link to the Issue.

On our [Design board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/3), tasks generally move left to right after being triaged:

1. **Backlog** - Tasks end up here unless they’re urgent and require immediate attention
2. **This week** - Hopefully this is self-explanatory
3. **In progress** - Tasks we’ve started on, but haven’t yet completed
5. **Done** - Shipped! We like adding things to this column.

If you peek at our Figma files, we usually wrap up final mockups in a page called Deliverables. Any mocks in pages that appear to be faded out are considered _old_ and _out of date_ and can be ignored, as there is a better replacement nearby. (We sometimes want to keep them around for easy reference, but they're easily identifiable because their artboards are set to 50% opacity.)

## Sharing work in progress

We often share designs in early, unfinished phases on Slack in [#design-feedback](https://posthog.slack.com/messages/design-feedback). This is typically when we’re looking for time-sensitive feedback. If your specific feedback is requested, we'll tag you.

Since our audience is developer-friendly, we have a built-in audience to gut check our designs!

We post here for visibility, but will always link to the relevant place for discussion. (It’s best to share direct feedback outside of Slack so our contributors have context into design decisions.)


### **Wireframes**

If an early draft is being shared, we'll likely build a low fidelity wireframe in something like Balsamiq. At this stage, we're mostly focused on laying out content, crafting messaging, and loosely tying in a visual hierarchy and layout. (Don't look too closely at fonts, specific colors, or visualizations - those come later.)

*Note: Balsamiq uses its own Comic Sans-style font. Don't get hung up on this!*

Once a design is laid out, we'll move into hi-fidelity mockups built in Figma. This process usually takes a few rounds to perfect, and we often iterate up until the moment the design is passed off for development.


## **Providing feedback**

When we share a design, we do our best to explain the type of feedback we're looking for. (Ex: Overall visual aesthetic, flow, if a design communicates to our developer-focused audience, etc.)

If a screenshot is posted directly to a Github issue, that's a great place for feedback.

Some of the design tools we use, like Balsamiq and Figma, both have built-in commenting. If we provide a link to a prototype in one of these tools, and if your feedback is specific to an element on a mockup, please leave a comment using the app's comment system. This helps us review and take action on comments later, and creates a single place for discussion around a particular topic.

If your feedback is higher level, summarize your feedback in the GitHub Issue itself for a higher-level discussion.

Important to note: We prioritize feedback based on alignment with business goals. (If feedback is more of a personal opinion than a business-related perspective, we’ll note it but will consider it within that context.)

Note: The [#design-feedback](https://posthog.slack.com/messages/design-feedback) channel isn’t just limited to the design team! If you're looking for a second opinion on the UX of something you're building, we encourage anyone to share screenshots and a link to Figma or wherever the mockup was produced so we can provide useful feedback or assist in iterating on a design.

If the design requires further collaboration, create an Issue using our [design request process](/handbook/company/working-with-design).

### Objective 1: Nail Data Exploration

1. Build v0.1 of the data exploration system
2. Run a design sprint with Cory
3. Ship v2

#### Why?

Product reason:

- We have a pretty good interface for data *visualization* (trends, funnels, retention, etc), but not so much for data 
  *exploration* (events, persons). Users have been asking for more.
- The biggest pain comes from not being able to move between different types of related data. Imagine [this scenario](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/7963#issuecomment-1010235411) (© @rcmarron)
> 0) Found an anomaly about feature usage in trends
> 1) "I wonder which paying organizations have used feature Y"
> 2) Search for that event/action and change the tab to organizations
> 3) "Interesting CompanyXYZ is using it, I wonder who"
> 4) Flip to persons + add an organization filter for CompanyXYZ
> 5) See the persons
> 6) "I wonder how/why they're using it"
> 7) Click recordings + see the recordings
> It would be pretty clunky/impossible to explore your data in that way with today's interface. 
- Currently you need to re-create this same filtered query on 3-4 different pages and manually copy over the properties. 
  It's doable, but not a great experience. 

Code reason:
- We have a lot of bespoke bridges to show related data in the interface (people on insights, recordings on people).
- Every new one adds more complexity. 
- This compounded by ever so slightly different use of filters on different data types.
- The further we continue down this path, the harder it'll be to have a fully integrated product across all data.

Meta reason:
- We now have separate product teams. 
- If we're not careful, we'll end up with inoperable products. 
- This builds the first shared bridge between all of them.

#### Potential ideas for how?
- Universal Search: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/7963 (Note: this doesn't mean natural language text search)
- An "explore" interface/table, which supports input from various swappable data sources, with a unified set of filters applied to data.
- Support for custom columns and [formulas](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/11913) on those tables.
- Ability to save as a cohorts, save as an action, or export as a CSV when the data permits.
- The ability to link to these tables from anywhere. "Explore further" links wherever we show *any* data in the interface.

#### Future steps.
- Replace all other data tables in the app (events list, persons list, etc) with this interface.
- Interconnect all the ideas here: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/3765
- Add this power to the toolbar. E.g. add an action, see user recordings and explore further.

### Objective 2: Support performant querying of every insight type at a scale of billions scale events

1. Phantom is happy with query performance
2. Instrument and significantly improve query performance for this scale of events

_Note: We might need additional support from Karl for this_

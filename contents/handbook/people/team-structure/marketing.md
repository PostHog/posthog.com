## Mission

Increase the number of [relevant](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/strategy#target-audience-for-2021) visitors to our website. 

## Q3 2022 Goals

* **Objective**:
    * Accelerate word of mouth growth by significantly increasing awareness of what PostHog does as a company and as a product

* **Key Results:**
    * Average 420 new org signups per week
    * 5,000 organic Google pageviews per week
    * Get 20 reviews on our G2 profile

* **Rationale:**
    * Word of mouth continues to be our main driver of growth, but we want to be more focused in our approach, and in particular shift focus a bit from ‘telling people PostHog exists’ to ‘telling people what PostHog does’, given we’ve now done quite a lot of top of funnel brand awareness, sponsorships etc.
     
    * Moving from tracking all user signups to orgs only means Marketing is focused on the number that we can actually influence the most.

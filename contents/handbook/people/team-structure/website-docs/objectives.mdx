* **Objective**:
    * Make posthog.com a great resource for new and returning users
* **Key Results**:
    * 25% decrease in support tickets per customer
    * Ensure the top 50 [most visited Docs pages](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awe15l2_Hy8EMcbGeiCLlhv03pRpiqD3PG_7Q_FnESo/edit#gid=420779973) are up to date
    * Make sure the conversion rate doesn’t fall
* **Rationale**:
    * Whilst we don’t want to eliminate our engineer:engineer interaction, there are likely 10x as many lurkers who never solve their problems.
    * Producing an exceptional documentation experience will encourage more word of mouth growth.
    * I currently think the dev advocate should go into the website & docs team

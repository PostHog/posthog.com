* **Objective**:
    * Make posthog.com an exceptional experience for new and returning users
* **Key Results**:
    * We enable the community to contribute feedback on what we're building
    * We keep the docs updated with any new functionality
    * Make apps easy to maintain - make sure they all work, get them into a monorepo, with a standard approach to tests.
* **Rationale**:
    * posthog.com is now regularly referenced as a gold standard website, like Stripe (!). We should go from 'great' to 'exceptional' to get more word of mouth growth and to double down on brand.
    * On apps, we want to improve their docs. However, we've realized getting them to work first is the priority - and the way to achieve that is to get them maintainable.
    * In Q3, we wanted to check that conversion rates didn't fall as we did some large positioning changes. We should now monitor this as part of business as usual, but it's not as important as we don't anticipate large positioning changes this quarter.

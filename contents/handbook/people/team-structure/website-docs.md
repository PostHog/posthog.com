## How we work

The [Website & Docs board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/13) is used for enhancements to posthog.com (including handbook) and our docs. Artwork for blog is handled separately, and is explained below.

1. **[Design] Backlog** _- a mostly stack ranked list of tasks_
1. **[Design] In progress**
1. **Ready for development** _- completed designs that are awaiting implementation_
1. **[Development] Backlog** _- mostly stack ranked_
1. **[Development] In progress**
1. **Done**

Designs for website & docs typically start in Balsamiq wireframes, then progress into hi-fi designs in Figma. [Read more about this process.](/handbook/company/website-design-process)

### Blog artwork and marketing assets

Because of the volume of content we publish, blog artwork has its own dedicated [Artwork](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/14) project board managed by Lottie.

When [authoring a blog post](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog), add the `Artwork` project board so we can create visuals and make sure the post is listed on our [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit) with a publish date.

## **Providing feedback**

When we share a design, we do our best to explain the type of feedback we're looking for. (Ex: Overall visual aesthetic, flow, if a design communicates to our developer-focused audience, etc.)

If a screenshot is posted directly to a Github issue, that's a great place for feedback. (If a comment already covers your feedback, we encourage the use of an emoji response over additional comments like "+1".)

Some of the design tools we use, like Balsamiq and Figma, both have built-in commenting, which is useful for prototypes with multiple pages. If we provide a link to a prototype in one of these tools, please leave a comment using the app's comment system. This helps us review and take action on comments later, and creates a single place for discussion around a particular topic.

**Important:** We prioritize feedback based on alignment with business goals. _Everyone has feedback about design._ (If feedback is more of a personal opinion than a business-related perspective, we’ll note it, but don't be offended if your feedback isn't specifically addressed!)

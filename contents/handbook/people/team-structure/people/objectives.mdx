* **Proposed Objective:**
    * Grow PostHog team by 20% without compromising team happiness or our runway
* **Proposed Key Results:**
    * We have offers accepted by a senior product manager, 2x SREs, senior data engineer, developer advocate, and 4x full stack engineer.
    * We stay within 5% of forecast cash burn. 
    * Ship 3 projects that make working at PostHog more seamless for the team - app management (Okta), migrate recruitment (Workable), self-serve equity management (LTSE Equity).
* **Rationale:**
    * Other teams depend on us hiring and retaining exceptional talent. And we need to do that without running out of money or forgetting to keep improving PostHog as a place to work.

Hogpatch is our San Francisco coworking space, shared with a handpicked group of YC founders who are active PostHog users. Teammates in the Bay Area (or visiting) are welcome to drop in regularly to work, meet users, gather feedback, or join events we host in the space. Here’s a quick guide to how it all operates.


**<TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo />**, our Office Manager, is on site **Mondays to Thursdays from 9am–5pm**. For any issues while she is not in, please reach out to the `#project-hogpatch` channel or DM her directly.

## Building access

PostHog teammates don’t need an invite to use Hogpatch — the space is open for you whenever you’re in town. If you know your SF travel dates in advance, it’s helpful to post in the #sf-bay-area channel so we can make sure the space is ready for you.

- If you are visiting for the first time, ring the **black intercom doorbell** on the front door.
- <TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo /> will be notified and will remotely unlock the door for you.
 - <TeamMember name="Carol Donnelly" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Scott Lewis" photo /> also share intercom access so can open the door for you 24/7.
- There’s no check-in or reservations needed, it's a very relaxed setup.

## Parking

- We have a garage in the building that allows up to **4–5 cars max**.
- This is for **internal employees only**, and spots are limited.
- Please ask **<TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo />** if you’d like a **fob**. If you're driving in as a one-off, let Judy know beforehand so she can let you in/out on the day you visit. Always remember to close the garage door when leaving the premises. If you're worried you have forgotten, Judy can double check this via CCTV.

## Housekeeping

- If you notice anything missing or that needs replenishing, reach out to <TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo /> on the `#project-hogpatch` channel.
- A **cleaner** is scheduled to come in **once a week** to tidy up and water plants. This will be updated when we open to YC founders/frequent visitors.
- A **gardener** comes in **every two weeks** to maintain the plants around the space.

## FYIs
  
- **Please turn off the lights** in the building if you’re the last to leave for the night. The phone booths have lights that will automatically turn off.
- Remember to **lock your laptop** when you step away from your screen.
- If you see **unfamiliar faces** (that don’t look like YC founders), raise any concerns with Judy.

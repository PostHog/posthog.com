Hogpatch is our San Francisco coworking space, shared with a handpicked group of YC founders who are active PostHog users. Teammates in the Bay Area (or visiting) are welcome to drop in regularly to work, meet users, gather feedback, or join events we host in the space. Hereâ€™s a quick guide to how it all operates.


**<TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo />**, our Office Manager, is on site **Mondays to Thursdays from 9amâ€“5pm**. For any issues while she is not in, please reach out to the `#project-hogpatch` channel or DM her directly.


> ðŸš§ The space is still a WIP (est. opening **Nov 2025**) so proactively flag things that need to be fixed.

## Building access

PostHog teammates donâ€™t need an invite to use Hogpatch â€” the space is open for you whenever youâ€™re in town. If you know your SF travel dates in advance, itâ€™s helpful to post in the #sf-bay-area channel so we can make sure the space is ready for you.


- If you are visiting for the first time, ring the **black intercom doorbell** on the front door.
- <TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo /> will be notified and will remotely unlock the door for you.
- In the future, guests/visitors will be able to unlock doors with digital wallet passes that automatically expire after a set time.
- These passes will be sent to **YC founders and PostHog visitors via email invite**.
- Thereâ€™s no check-in or reservations needed, it's a very relaxed setup.

## Parking

- We have a garage in the building that allows up to **4â€“5 cars max**.
- This is for **internal employees only**, and spots are limited.
- Please ask **<TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo />** if youâ€™d like a **fob**.
- If you donâ€™t plan to drive in often, let <TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo /> know beforehand so she can let you in/out on the day you visit.

## Housekeeping

### How to make service/supply requests

- If you notice anything missing or that needs replenishing, reach out to <TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo /> on the `#project-hogpatch` channel.
- Weâ€™ll have teething problems while we figure out how folks use the space, so bear with us. We are constantly learning.
- If you have specific requests, ask <TeamMember name="Judy Opperwall" photo />.

- A **cleaner** is scheduled to come in **once a week** to tidy up and water plants. This will be updated when we open to YC founders/frequent visitors.
- A **gardener** comes in **every two weeks** to maintain the plants around the space.

## FYIs
  
- **Please turn off the lights** in the building if youâ€™re the last to leave for the night.  
  (The phone booths have lights that will automatically turn off.)

- If you see **unfamiliar faces** (that donâ€™t look like YC founders), theyâ€™re most likely **contractors** we've hired.  
  Judy is tracking all temporary visitors. If you have concerns, raise them with her.

Outside of [pay and equity](handbook/people/compensation), we offer a number of additional benefits to our teamm.

With everyone being distributed across the work, we do our best to provide comparable benefits and perks for everyone, but they might vary slightly by country.

### 401k/pension contributions

In the UK, we use [Royal London](https://www.royallondon.com/) as our pension provider. The employee contributes 5%, PostHog contributes 4%, but you can opt out, in case you don't want to contribute. 

We are currently in the process of setting up a 401k for our US team. [Deel](https://app.letsdeel.com/), our international payroll provider is currently building a pension product for contractors as well. We will aim to provide the same percentages as in the UK.

### Health Insurance

We currently provide health insurance in the US and the UK. 

In the US, our medical insurance is provided via UnitedHealthcare and managed via our payroll provider [Gusto](https://app.gusto.com/). The plan includes medical, dental and vision insurance. 

PostHog pays 75% of the premium of the platinum plan, you will pay the other 25%. The same conditions apply to added dependents. UnitedHealthcare also offers Gold and Silver plans on a lower cost, so you might end up contributing less, depending on the plan you choose. The exact costs depend on factors like age, we can create a quote in Gusto. 

In the UK, we use [Bupa](https://www.bupa.co.uk/) for our private healthcare (£100 excess per policy year) and [Medicash] as our Cashplan for dental and vision (Children are included for free). 

Both of them create tax liability and they will effect your Personal Allowance each tax year, you can opt out at any time with 1 month notice. 

### Mental health

Our world can feel a bit heavy from time to time and we want to make sure everyone gets support, if they need it. 

We launched [Spill](https://www.spill.chat/) in March 2021 to give everyone in the team access to mental health support. Spill offers access to exercises and reading material via Slack and you can also book video therapy sessions with a qualified therapist. 

Spill is 100% free and confidential, they do not share any information with PostHog (_with the exception of threads to our own safety or the safety of others)_. 

### Generous time off

Everyone in the team has [unlimited, permissionless time off](/handbook/people/time-off). This means you won't need to ask for permission before requesting time off, our HR Tool [CharlieHR](https://posthog.charliehr.com/) will autoapprove your request.  

We also offer generous [parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off#parental-leave) for new parents. 

### Learning and Development

We currently offer a [Training budget](/handbook/training/#training-budget) and [free books](/handbook/people/training#books) for 

### Equipment and co-working

Due to our remote nature, we provide [all equipment](/handbook/people/spending-money#equipment) you need to have an ergonomic setup at home to be as productive as possible. 

If you ever need change of scenery, we offer $200/month budget towards [coworking or café working](/handbook/people/spending-money#work-space). 

### Off-sites and team socials

Ideally, we would like to meet up in person at twice a year. The team was able to meet up in Italy in September 2020, but we haven't been able to travel every since, so we are planning a virtual off-site in April 2021 instead (and hopefully a real one on Autumn 2021).

For any work-related travel, we use [Project Wren](https://www.wren.co/) for Carbon offsetting. 

We also have biweekly coffee catchs up with the team and we use the [Donut](https://www.donut.com/?ref=slackdirectory) Slack app to pair you up with random colleague on Slack. Simply join the #virtual-coffee channel on Slack and be paired up with someone on the team to meet for a virtual coffee/tea etc.

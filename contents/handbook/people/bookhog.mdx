BookHog is PostHog's official book club. We meet once a month to discuss a particular book. Radical. 

Michael is the organizer and picks the next book to read through a pseudo-democratic process. Previous themes have included 'unorthodox manoeuvres', 'short stories', and 'super mainstream beach reads'. All discussion and voting for the next book to read happens in the `#books-and-films` Slack channel. Previous books we have read:

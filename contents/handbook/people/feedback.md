## Feedback at PostHog

Sharing and receiving feedback openly is _really_ important to us at PostHog. Part of creating a highly autonomous culture where people feel empowered is maintaining the most transparent and open flow of information that we can. 

This includes giving feedback [to each other](/handbook/company/values#tread-on-toes), so we know we are working on the right things, in the right way. While giving feedback to a team member can feel awkward, especially if it is not positive or if you are talking to someone with more experience than you, we believe that it is an important part of [not letting others fail](/handbook/company/culture#dont-let-others-fail). 

'Open and honest' != 'being an asshole' - we expect feedback to be direct, but shared with good intentions and in the spirit of genuinely helping that person and PostHog as a whole to improve. 

## Performance Reviews

In addition to informal day-to-day feedback, it is important that we enable team members to take a step back every so often and look at their performance in a wider context. This helps us to support a team member's growth and ensure it is aligned with PostHog's needs. 

We have developed a simple performance review process to support this. We strongly believe that [it is _not_ a manager's responsibility](/handbook/company/management) to give their team members feedback, except in their capacity as any other individual contributor. 

This process is intended to be self-serve. The People team will ensure the process is kicked off and recorded properly, but it is the individual team member's responsibility to run the process. If you need support, ask your manager, Eltje or Charles for help. 

We currently run performance reviews every 6 months, based on your start date. We will probably need to change this cadence as we scale, but this feels appropriate for our current stage of growth. 

### The Performance Review Process

1. The People team will get an alert in Charlie HR every 6 months that someone is due to have their review.
2. They will schedule a 1 hour feedback meeting for the team member, with an open invitation to _anyone_ at PostHog who wants to give feedback. It will be the team member's responsibility to encourage people to join if they would like their feedback. If you would be more comfortable with your manager facilitating the session, please ask them do so! A member of the people team may sit in on the occasional feedback meeting to see how well they are working. 
3. The team member's manager then summarises the outcome of that meeting in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fxP0w_gNno7Y-2Uxw4uSYCaJTpvZpDXiFZ7lFPXsDpw/edit?usp=sharing).
4. The team member also writes up their own self-assessment in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UbS9YkGDZsAhPsZmxRRI2g83ZuQzPwoQNQeJ7IGBm9I/edit?usp=sharing).
7. Within a week of the feedback meeting, the team member and their manager should have a 30min 1-1 followup discussion to reflect on the feedback and align on next steps.
8. The manager then communicates back to the People team that the review is complete and what next steps are needed (if any), including around any salary adjustments if the team member's Step or Level should change. The People team will store these docs on Charlie HR for future reference.

Part of the followup conversation with your manager will include your [compensation](/handbook/people/compensation), as we directly link this to your level of experience and your performance. You should not, however, expect every performance review to result in a change to your salary. You will find that your Step will change more frequently than your Level.

### How to Give Good Feedback

We know that giving feedback can sometimes be difficult, so here are a few tips on how to give good feedback:

- If something went wrong, focus on what has actually happened, not on whose fault it is. Assigning blame is not productive. 
- Be as specific as you can with your feedback. An example can be helpful to give the recipient context. 
- Sometimes a question can be more useful if you feel you lack the full context. For example 'I've noticed that you do sometimes do X. Can you explain to me what your thought process is when you are doing that?' 
- If your feedback is about behavior, focus on the behavior itself and its impact on you, rather than attacking the person's character. For example 'When you do X, it makes me feel Y. Would you be willing to do Z instead?'
- Remember that positive feedback is really important - we should reinforce and affirm the things we want that person to keep doing!

### How to Receive Feedback Well

If someone is making the effort to give you feedback, you should reciprocate by receiving that feedback well. Being a good feedback receiver means that people will be more inclined to give you feedback in the future, which will help you to grow!

Here are a few tips to help you do this:

- Assume positive intent on the part of the feedback giver. 
- Try not to hear attack - listen for what is behind the words.
- It can be useful to paraphrase the feedback to ensure you have understood it correctly, or ask questions to clarify. 
- You do not have to accept all feedback! However, it's probably worth taking time to reflect on it, rather than reacting in the moment. There is a difference between acknowledging feedback and disagreeing with it.

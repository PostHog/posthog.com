## Help the company win

- Understand your teamâ€™s _and_ company objectives
  - Ship fast towards these
  - Give / receive direct feedback to help yourself / others do the same
  - Fix problems when you see them. Early objectives are often wrong.

You are what you do. Getting promoted in a company that is struggling, is very hard. However, if the company is succeeding, it'll be easy to justify, _and_ to afford, pay rises where people are performing very well.

- Give a shit about your work, your team and our users

These three are the inputs that lead to the output of career progression. If you focus on yourself, no value is provided and you won't progress. Having a consistently caring attitude will in the long term lead to progression - if you do this, PostHog will progress you.

- When we IPO, you will literally walk into any job anywhere

Whilst being able to talk about all the cool stuff you built will help you in your future career, being an early employee that took us from very early to public is a huge, exceptionally rare, career achievement. That's how you leap multiple positions into an exec role, or whatever else you want to do.

## Ways we help you progress

- Hire and maintain a team of excellent people all working transparently you can learn from

We are disciplined with maintaining a high bar. And since everyone works so transparently, you can learn from watching what everyone is doing - from how board meetings work, to why we picked a company strategy, down to why our frontend is the way it is.

- Give you loads of autonomy

We don't limit you, and will push for much more than you may think is possible. It will feel hard.

- Give you lots of interesting problems to work on

PostHog has a wide variety of challenges - from data, to entire new products and features, to design and UX polish. On the go to market side, we're wildly different - you'll learn about self serve, bottom up adoption, handling a community, and how giving things away for free leads to us making money.

We have small teams - we can move people around as we grow to provide variety and to let people switch up their focus if things get stale.

- Lightweight management

You have someone to talk to, but without being micromanaged.

- Build a huge open source portfolio

Better than a fancy title - you can show future employers what you built and the problems you solved.

- Your team around you see your everyday work more than a manager - get direct feedback from them

Great people + direct feedback = learning.

## Ways we do not help you progress

- A checklist of things / a formal career progression framework

This is self-interested by its nature, so is the wrong way to think of progression.

- Fancy titles

We don't have a complex array of titles - we want people to be as equal as possible, so we have autonomy versus micromanagement. Your open source work speaks for itself.

- Getting a manager to progress you

No one else can really do this for you. It has to be intrinsic to be sustainable.

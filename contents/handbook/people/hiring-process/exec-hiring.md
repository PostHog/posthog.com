## Exec hiring at PostHog

We deliberately keep our [structure flat](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#structured-for-speed-and-autonomy) and we donâ€™t believe in having a lot of fancy titles early on. However, as we grow, we will hire people into more Executive-type positions. 

With our exec hiring, moreso than normal, we are aiming for speed, and as always, quality. If a candidate is amazing but doesn't fit with a specific role need we have _right now_, we aim to treat the hiring process with the same urgency as if the website has gone down! 

### Executive hiring process

#### Preparation

Before we kick-off the hiring process for an Executive role, we make sure to have everything we need for the role prepared: 

*   James or Tim to write job description, People team to review
*   Post role - share in our networks
*   Ask investors for referrals
*   Agree on salary benchmark and equity level
*   Finalise interview process
*   The People team will build a market map and share it with the leadership team, outreach ideally coming from the founders


#### Interview process

In order to ensure speed, we are aiming to finish the process within 5 working days (assuming the candidate has availability). 

In order to achieve this, the interview process roughly follows this structure: 

**Day 1: Candidate meets Eltje -** _30-45 minutes_

*   Culture
*   Important information: time frame, salary expectations (base and Equity), visa, other open processes
*   Answer open Qs

**Day 2: Candidate meets James and/or Tim** - _45-60 minutes_

*   History, mission, vision
*   Role responsibilities
*   Role outlook (team, development etc)

**Day 3: Technical Interview with James/Tim + respective team -** _60 minutes_

*   Background and experience
*   Technical Deep-dive
*   Scenario-based questions

**Day 3: Meet rest of the Leadership team - Marcus and Charles -** _30-45 minutes_

*   Strategy and long term outlook
*   Culture fit

**Day 4: [SuperDay](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/hiring-process#posthog-superday) (_optional_) or meet the team (standup or informal lunch)**

**Day 4: Wrap up call with James and/or Tim -** _30 minutes_

*   Answer any open questions, potentially talk about offer details already
*   Eltje to follow up via Email

**Day 5: Offer out**

*   Eltje to send official offer and comp sheet with James/Tim/Charles in CC
*   James/Tim/Charles to drop a quick message how excited they are
*   ðŸ¤ž

> Depending on the role, we might also schedule a call with one of our investors.

We take exceptional people when they come along - and we really mean that! Donâ€™t see a specific role listed? That doesn't mean we won't have a spot for you. 

In cases where a candidate reaches out without us having a role posted, we follow the same process as above, and work through all open tasks we would usually prepare for on day 1 and 2.

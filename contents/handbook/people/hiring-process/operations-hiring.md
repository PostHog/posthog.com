## People & Ops hiring at PostHog

People & Ops at PostHog covers legal, finance, people and culture. 

This is our smallest team, and we don’t hire very often. That means that each new hire has a disproportionately high impact compared with other, larger teams. Please check our [careers page](/careers) for our open roles. 

### What we are looking for in Operations hires

Outside of the skills listed in the job description, we are generally looking for: 

*   Warmth and positive energy - the kind of person that other people _want_ to ask for help
*   Proactive and organised, with a strong attention to detail
*   Ability to prioritize 
*   You are not afraid to step on toes - you have a bias to action and lots of initiative
*   Top-notch communication skills, setting an example to the rest of the team
*   Willingness to dive in and learn technical concepts and engage with tools like GitHub


### Operations hiring process 

#### Culture interview

This is our usual first round interview with a member of the People & Ops team. 

#### Technical Interview 

The [technical interview](/handbook/people/hiring-process#interview-2) usually lasts between 45-60 minutes and you will probably meet a member of our [People and Culture team](/handbook/small-teams/people) as well as [Charles](/community/profiles/254). For this round, you can expect questions about your background, together with scenario-based questions. 

#### Operations SuperDay

The final stage of our interview process is what we call a PostHog [SuperDay](/handbook/people/hiring-process#posthog-superday). This is a paid full day of work with us, which we can flexibly arrange around your schedule. 

We will share the task with you at the start of the day. The task is representative of the work someone in this role at PostHog is doing, and it is always the same for each candidate, so we can make clear comparisons. It will typically involve doing actual PostHog work, e.g. sourcing candidates or planning an offsite. 

An Operations SuperDay usually looks like this  (_there is a degree of flexibility due to time zone differences):_

*   Kick-off session
*   Meet the founders
*   Time to focus on the task, we can provide support via your personal Slack channel 
*   Informal session with a team member 
*   On days when we have company wide meetings, we will invite you along to that and give you a chance to introduce yourself. On days without company wide meetings, we will arrange for you to meet a few members of our team for a casual lunch/coffee break

Overall, you should spend at least 80% of your time and energy on the task and less than 20% on meeting people, as we will base our decision on your output of the day. However, we encourage everyone to use the Slack channel as much as needed for any questions or problems. 

> In line with our [values](/handbook/company/values) and [culture](/handbook/company/culture), you might get short replies like "step on toes" or "bias for action".

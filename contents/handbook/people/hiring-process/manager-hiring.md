## Manager hiring at PostHog

* The best source of leads is within the company
  * We know they understand the details.
  * We know they're a cultural fit.
  * This helps retain good people already working here that may want to try this out.
  * It's easier to teach a great individual contributor the basic management skills than it is the other way around.
  * More of a two way door - we can move people back if they already work here, but we probably would have to let someone go if they joined specifically to manage.
* They have to be good at the individual contributor work in that team - the manager can't be the person that fills a huge gap in the team. This is more inspiring.
* If there's a candidate that is a strong individual contributor that can do leadership, we should consider hiring them, even if we don't have the perfect role yet. We suspect having enough people like this at PostHog will become the limit to our scalability one day.
  * We should bring this person in to solve 1-2 meaty technical problems first, before doing the full role.

## Sales and Customer Success hiring at PostHog

The [Sales](/teams/sales-cs) look after customers paying $20k a year or more for PostHog, as well as new customers who _may_ end up in that bucket.  The job of the team is to land and expand usage of PostHog in these customers. We have two roles on the sales team: Technical Account Executives focused on closing new business from inbound and outbound leads; and Technical Account Managers focused on expansion from existing customers and closing new business from product-led leads.

We've proven that [the way we do sales](/sales) works at a small scale, we are now growing the team in line with increased top-of-funnel growth for PostHog. Please check our [careers page](/careers) for our open roles. 

### What we are looking for in Sales and CS hires

Outside of the skills listed in the job description, we are generally looking for: 

*   Technical aptitude - our team members are the primary person responsible for the customer relationship, and that includes solving technical problems.
*   Great interpersonal skills - we need people that our customers are excited to work with.
*   A genuine passion for helping customers be successful.
*   Prioritization skills - you'll be working with a book of business at different states and will have to prioritize your work accordingly.
*   People who are motivated by revenue growth.

### How we evaluate candidates

We need to be particularly sensitive to culture at this stage. We can handle someone underperforming much better than someone who is a poor culture fit due to the impact on the broader team. We don't want to end up taking cold leads from BDRs so we can run MEDPICC from our car phone while promising 50% discounts if they sign before the next full moon. We want someone who is comfortable carrying a sales conversation while also possessing the technical chops to talk to engineers and get their hands dirty.

We want someone who can own technical problems and even if they don't have the answer, understand enough of the context to provide that to engineers. We want someone who sees themselves as the first line of defense for our engineers, because engineering time is valuable; it's a win when they can solve a problem without additional engineering lean in.

A great litmus test for a candidate is if they are comfortable instrumenting PostHog and can speak to how they actually implement it on a site. That's typically a good indicator that they've got the right technical prowess.

We want someone who is in it to develop customers for the long run, we don't want someone who is here for quick churn and burn to pump up quota attainment. Building a relationship with a product engineer requires actually knowing PostHog, not just knowing *about* PostHog.

Ultimately, we want someone who we'd want to buy from.

### Sales and CS hiring process 

#### Culture interview

This is our usual first round interview with a member of the People & Ops team. 

#### Technical Interview 

The technical interview with [Simon](/community/profiles/28895) usually lasts 45 minutes.  For this round, we will use scenario-based questions to assess your technical and customer skills, as well as knowledge of PostHog. As part of this, we will ask you to give a quick pitch of PostHog (not a full demo). 

#### Small Team Screen

In this 30-minute interview, you'll be meeting with [Tim](/tim) who will be trying to answer "Would I buy from this person?"

#### Sales and CS SuperDay

The final stage of our interview process is what we call a PostHog [SuperDay](/handbook/people/hiring-process#posthog-superday). This is a paid full day of work, which we can flexibly arrange around your schedule. 

We will share the task with you at the start of the day. The task is representative of the work someone in this role at PostHog is doing, and it is always the same for each candidate, so we can make clear comparisons. It will typically involve doing actual PostHog work, e.g. prioritizing customers, doing a demo, etc. 

An Sales and CS SuperDay usually looks like this  (_there is a degree of flexibility due to time zone differences):_

*   Kick-off session
*   Meet with [James](/james)
*   Time to focus on the task, we can provide support via your personal Slack channel 
*   Demo role-play with [Charles](/charles) and [Simon](/community/profiles/28895)
*   Meet a few members of our team for a quick chat

Overall, you should spend at least 80% of your time and energy on the task and less than 20% on meeting people, as we will base our decision on your output of the day. However, we encourage everyone to use the Slack channel as much as needed for any questions or problems. 

> In line with our [values](/handbook/company/values) and [culture](/handbook/company/culture), you might get short replies like "step on toes" or "bias for action".

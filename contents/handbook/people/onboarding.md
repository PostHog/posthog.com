As a remote organisation, doing a great job of welcoming a new member of the PostHog team is really important. You may find that you need to invest extra time and effort into onboarding someone than you might at a company where everyone is physically located together. 

We have members working all around the world, so their onboarding process may look a little different depending on where they are based and what type of contract they are on. We either bring on new people as an employee or contractor (with equivalent terms and benefits as an employee) dependent on the jurisdiction.

If you have any questions on any of this stuff, ask Charles, James or Tim. 

The best way to run through this checklist is to copy the relevant sections below into an onboarding issue on the [Ops Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/2) in GitHub.

## Upon Offer Acceptance

Eltje or Charles will create the contract needed, depending on who is joining. Only James and Tim are allowed to sign on behalf of the company.

## PostHog buddy

Starting a new job is really exciting, but it can also be a little bit overwhelming. To make your first few weeks a bit easier, we started a buddy system. 
The buddy can help with any questions that pop up and with socializing during the first couple of weeks at PostHog. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it’s nice to have a dedicated person to help. 

We will pair people in similar time zones to make sure you get the most out of each other. The goal is to have a catch up at least once a week during the first few weeks, including time to chat about non-work topics.

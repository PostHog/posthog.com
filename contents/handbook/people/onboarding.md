Welcome to PostHog! 

Giving a new joiner a great experience is very important to us, especially given our remote nature. It is always easier to onboard someone while being physically in the same location, so we might to invest some extra time to make sure everyone has all the information and support they need during their first few weeks.  

We have members working all around the world, so their onboarding process may look a little different depending on where they are based and which team they are in. 

The people team will copy the relevant sections of the checklist into an onboarding issue on the [internal, non-public Ops & People board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/2) in GitHub, and tag all relevant people. 

As always, this is a living document and it changes every now and then, so it's worth keeping an eye on this page. 

## Upon offer acceptance

Eltje or Charles will create the contract needed, depending on who is joining. Only James and Tim are allowed to sign on behalf of the company.

- [ ] If we are employing someone in a new state for the first time, check the tax filing requirements on Gusto as soon as possible, as there can be a long lead time. We use [Middesk Agent] to help with the registration, log in details are in the People Ops vault on 1Password.

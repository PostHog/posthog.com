As a remote organisation, doing a great job of welcoming a new member of the PostHog team is really important. You may find that you need to invest extra time and effort into onboarding someone than you might at a company where everyone is physically located together. 

We have members working all around the world, so their onboarding process may look a little different depending on where they are based and what type of contract they are on. If you have any questions, ask Charles, James or Tim. 

## Upon Offer Acceptance

Charles will create the contract needed, depending on who is joining. Only James and Tim are allowed to sign on behalf of the company.

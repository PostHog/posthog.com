## Finance principles

This is how we think about financing PostHog as a business:

- Weâ€™re efficient because it allows us to build more products.
- We want to _always_ be default alive.
  - Losing control means becoming inefficient, because we would need to raise more money from VCs, who would push us for more aggressive growth to meet _their_ goals. This means building fewer products and spending more on shorter-term bets, like large sales teams. 
  - Being default alive means that profitability is always an option we can take, even if it is not a goal right now.
- Going from inefficient to efficient is _really_ hard, so we always want to default to being efficient. When we think about our products, this means:
    - Hiring efficiency always matters.
      - New products start with just 1 or 2 people - we don't spin up a whole team on day 1.
      - Products at scale should stay efficient as they'll be able to ship faster without worrying about coordination costs. 
    - COGS only matter at scale.
      - New products shouldn't have to worry about this - they should optimize for speed.
      - Products at scale have to be profitable - if they aren't, we won't stay default alive. 
- We trust the team to spend money sensibly in the best interests of PostHog, and not to waste money.

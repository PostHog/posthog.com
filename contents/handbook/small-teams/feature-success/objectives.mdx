As always, reliability is the #1 unwritten goal: Making sure feature flags are reliable trumps every other objective.


### Objective: Get 5 reference customers for surveys

Last quarter, we built out surveys which has been very well received. This quarter, we're doubling down on surveys.

We will

- Launch pricing for surveys, make it its own standalone product.
- Build out features critical to paying users, like templates, better result visualisation, data export, and potentially event targeting for surveys.
- ???

### Objective: Get reference customers for feature flags and experiments

Last quarter, we launched pricing for feature flags, and this has been reasonably successful.

This quarter, we want to validate we have product market fit, and gather 3 reference customers for feature flags, and 2 for experiments. At the same time, we want to more aggressively market feature flags to larger startups.

This involves building:

- Reminders for stale feature flags
- Feature flag environments
- Clarifying experiment results and some [ease of use improvements](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/labels/feature%2Fexperimentation)

We've decided to deprioritise Q3's main goal, even though it's not complete yet, because based on the overall company strategy, focusing on the above goals makes more sense, and we're waiting for the underlying technology - notebooks - to further mature, and gather data on how users use our components in notebooks.

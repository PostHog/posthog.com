### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1: 10 Happy Android Replay Users 

We'll also release an alpha of iOS Mobile Replay.

Why? 

We've done the work's base and now we want to release the new Android SDK with session replay and onboard customers to validate the product. 

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2: People love replay even more

Why? - we want this product to be fit for everyone and understand where it doesn't spark joy and how we can increase the value people receive and feel.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 3: First-class mobile support in app.posthog.com

Why? We're making the mobile SDKs equivalent to the web SDKs. We want to make sure that the mobile SDKs are first-class citizens in app.posthog.com so that it is easy to use and explore your mobile data.

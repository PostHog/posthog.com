## Mission

We help customers understand _"the why"_ behind data and metrics in PostHog. Our tools help customers re-create, analyze, and understand the experience of individual users.

We build the [heads-up display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display) within your product

## Areas of responsibility

- **Session Replay** - recording browser or mobile sessions to be replayed later
- **Toolbar** - a floating helper on your web app that helps to toggle feature flags, display heatmaps and provide contextual analysis
- **Mobile SDKs** - the knowledge to level these up are in our team
- **Notebooks** - a way to explore your data in a free format environment, for example to add comments to a session replay

## A note on notebooks

(pun intended)

We own Notebooks the platform, but we aren't actively working on it while it beds in and customers show us what they use it for. We'll provide bugfixes to notebooks (the platform) and support to teams wanting to change their products in notebooks. But feature requests for existing products within notebooks (e.g. insights in notebooks) go to the team that own the product not to us.

## Mission

We help customers understand _"the why"_ behind data and metrics in PostHog. Our tools help customers re-create, analyze, and understand the experience of individual users.

We build the [heads-up display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display) within your product


## Q4 2023 Goals

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1 : Project "NoteForce Exploration 3000" (Ben, David)

Why? Pairing up with Michael, Thomas, and Cory from Team Product Analytics to focus on not just releasing Notebooks, but integrating them seamlessly with PostHog 3000 to make it a great experience to explore any and all data across PostHog.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2 : Mobile Session Replay (Manoel, Paul)

Why? - The people want it and we have the right skills in house to do a good job of this. Replay is the main focus, but making mobile a first-class citizen of PostHog is the real goal.

Follow along in [our Q4 MegaIssue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/17803)

## Areas of responsibility

- **Session Replay** - recording browser or mobile sessions to be replayed later
- **Toolbar** - a floating helper on your web app that helps to toggle feature flags, display heatmaps and provide contextual analysis
- **Notebooks** - a way to explore your data in a free format environment, for example to add comments to a session replay

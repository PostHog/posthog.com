## A note on notebooks

(pun intended)

We own Notebooks the platform, but we aren't actively working on it while it beds in and customers show us what they use it for. We'll provide bugfixes to notebooks (the platform) and support to teams wanting to change their products in notebooks. But feature requests for existing products within notebooks (e.g. insights in notebooks) go to the team that own the product not to us.

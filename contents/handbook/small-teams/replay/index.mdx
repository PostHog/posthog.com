## Mission

We help customers understand _"the why"_ behind data and metrics in PostHog. Our tools help customers re-create, analyze, and understand the experience of individual users.

We build the [heads-up display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display) within your product


## Q4 2023 Goals

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1: 10 Happy Android Replay User 

We'll also release an alpha of iOS Mobile Replay.

Why? 

We've done the work's base and now we want to release the new Android SDK with session replay and onboard customers to validate the product. 

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2: Reduce churn

Why? - Churn is higher than we'd like, this is a signal we're not getting some things right. We're not serving our users as well as we can until we're getting this right.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 3: First-class mobile support in app.posthog.com

Why? We're making the mobile SDKs equivalent to the web SDKs. We want to make sure that the mobile SDKs are first-class citizens in app.posthog.com so that it is easy to use and explore your mobile data.

## Areas of responsibility

- **Session Replay** - recording browser or mobile sessions to be replayed later
- **Toolbar** - a floating helper on your web app that helps to toggle feature flags, display heatmaps and provide contextual analysis
- **Mobile SDKs** - the knowledge to level these up are in our team

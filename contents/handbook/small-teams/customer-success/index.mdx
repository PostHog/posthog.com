## Principles

### Be customer obsessed

People contact us because they have a problem that they need help with.  Spend time understanding why they are talking to us and align all of your work with that.  Regularly check in with yourself and the customer and ask whether you are helping them to solve their problem.

Go at the speed of the customer.  If they want to move fast, we move fast.  If they want to take their time, be ready for them when they need us.

### Connect with Product

Customer feedback is a key part of our Product strategy.  Ensure that your customer needs are represented back into our Product team.

Understand the roadmap and get customers excited about what's new and coming soon.

### Be an expert

First and foremost, you should have a deep understanding of how our product is used by customers and how it benefits them.  A deep level of expertise will allow you to share knowledge and insights which perhaps the customer had not yet considered.  This will strengthen the adoption and trust the customer has in PostHog and our team.

### Tell a story

Compelling product demonstrations aren't about features; they tell the story of how a product solves a problem or pain.

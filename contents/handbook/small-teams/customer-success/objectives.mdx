* **Proposed Key Results:**
    * Finish Q4 with 24 more customers in the 20-100k ARR range than we started.
    * Every customer gets an automated CS intro email tailored based on their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
    * We can easily report on a customer's adoption and react according to where they are on the journey to provide maximum benefit.
* **Rationale:**
    * We have learned a lot from selling this year and now itâ€™s time to scale

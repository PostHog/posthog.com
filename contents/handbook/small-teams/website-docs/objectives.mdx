### Nail product pages

Our product pages are good, but not great. [We want to improve them](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/6845), especially by adding video, screenshots, and animations.

### Grow community engagement

In conjunction with the Marketing team, we'll focus on evolving our [Posts](/posts) section. The ultimate goal is to create a hub that is a destination for people to learn about product engineering and running a startup.

### Support other small teams with design + front end

Since the Website & Docs team is specialized in design and front end, we can help other teams with projects that are particuarly front end-focused, especially with widgets that appear on customer websites.

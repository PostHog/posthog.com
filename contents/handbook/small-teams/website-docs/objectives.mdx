### Objective #1: Grow community engagement

Having an active community is not only a positive signal for people looking into PostHog as a product, but also an important way for us to ensure we're prioritizing the right things.

As a byproduct of growing our community, we can also encourage users to support each other, thus reducing the load on our support hero.

#### Key results

1. Increase percentage of [community questions](/questions) vs support tickets
2. Grow retention of [/community](/community)
    1. Increase engagement on threads by third parties (people other than the original poster and PostHog core team)
    2. Increase number of filled out profile bios ([example](/community/profiles/69447f14-c399-469a-873b-da68ccc5f472))

### Objective #2: Level up our brand externally

Until now, the focus of the Website & Docs Team has been to create a stellar experience _on PostHog.com itself_. We now want to extend this to other places where people interact with our brand. Specifically, we'll focus on paid ads and video content.

As an experiment, we've decided to bring ad creative in-house. This has a few benefits:

1. We inherently know our product better than an agency.
1. We can work with the latest design assets.
1. Since our team understands our unique culture better than any third party can, we can extend our brand voice to our creative with fewer cycles.

#### Key results

1. Increase CTR from paid display ads
1. Grow traffic to our YouTube videos

<br />

### Objective #3: Nail API docs

PostHog can become stickier if we can make it easier for developers to integrate PostHog into their app or service. Our API docs are currently auto-generated. This was great as a v0.1, but now it's time to nail them.

#### Key results

1. Ensure every endpoint and parameter is documented
1. Improve developer experience
1. Increase API usage

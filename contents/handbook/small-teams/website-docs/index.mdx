## How we work

The [Website & Docs board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/13) is used for enhancements to posthog.com (including handbook) and our docs. Artwork for blog is handled separately, and is explained below.

1. **[Design] Backlog** _- a mostly stack ranked list of tasks_
1. **[Design] In progress**
1. **Ready for development** _- completed designs that are awaiting implementation_
1. **[Development] Backlog** _- mostly stack ranked_
1. **[Development] In progress**
1. **Done**

Designs for website & docs typically start in Balsamiq wireframes, then progress into hi-fi designs in Figma. [Read more about this process.](/handbook/design/designing-posthog-website)

### Blog artwork and marketing assets

Because of the volume of content we publish, blog artwork has its own dedicated [Artwork](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/14) project board managed by Lottie.

When [authoring a blog post](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog), add the `Artwork` project board so we can create visuals and make sure the post is listed on our [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit) with a publish date. [Learn more about our process.](/handbook/growth/marketing/exporting-blog-post-image)

## **Providing feedback**

When we share a design, we do our best to explain the type of feedback we're looking for. (Ex: Overall visual aesthetic, flow, if a design communicates to our developer-focused audience, etc.)

If a screenshot is posted directly to a Github issue, that's a great place for feedback. (If a comment already covers your feedback, we encourage the use of an emoji response over additional comments like "+1".)

Some of the design tools we use, like Balsamiq and Figma, both have built-in commenting, which is useful for prototypes with multiple pages. If we provide a link to a prototype in one of these tools, please leave a comment using the app's comment system. This helps us review and take action on comments later, and creates a single place for discussion around a particular topic.

**Important:** We prioritize feedback based on alignment with business goals. _Everyone has feedback about design._ (If feedback is more of a personal opinion than a business-related perspective, we’ll note it, but don't be offended if your feedback isn't specifically addressed!)

## Working with us

If you're in a team that isn't Website & Docs, and you want to make a change to the website, here is a guide to working with us.

Most helpful - objective changes:

* Fixing errors
* Adding missing functionality
* Correcting typos
* Fixing broken linsk

Less helpful / can be net negative - subjective changes:

* CTA changes / additions
* Wording changes, especially titles on the most prominent pages
* Menu / navigation structure changes
* Aesthetic changes
* Deleting prominent pages / large blocks of content

In general, with the above, it is more than likely that they have already had considerable thought put into them and this all will need explaining to you. In other situations, the above are known to be MVP state thus we are working on completely overhauling something - hence discussing and merging a potential iterative improvement may be as much effort as redoing something entirely.

Please do _not_ self merge your own PRs to posthog.com unless it is an emergency. This helps reduce errors.

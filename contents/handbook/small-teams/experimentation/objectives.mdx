### Objective: Increase usage and quality of experimentation. 

* **Key Result:**
 * Increase organizations that launch a paid experiment within 2 weeks of signing up from 7.5% to 20%
* **Key Result:** 
 * Retain retention of organizations on experimentation to 60%
* **Key Result:**
 * 10 confirmed decisions made from completed experiments. Either the organization deployed the feature or reverted and did not release

* **Rationale:**
 * Make sure that experimentation is a first class feature, Posthog users are excited to use alongside the rest of the analytics features


----- Suggested replacement for Experimentation focus

Objective: Ensure that feature flags can mature with users

* **Key Result:** X users on permission and alerting features
    - alerting/notification hooks to slack
    - access control
* **Key Result:** Qualitatively improve interface
    - highlight what’s completely rolled out
    - “last updated” column on table
    - (cohort creation improvement, flexible user additions)
* **Key Result:** Increase optional metric impact analysis by X%
    - make metric analysis selection part of the feature flag creation flow
    - suggest important insights to track against?
* **Key Result:** Release beta of developer integrated features with 5 users
    - connect codebase and show feature flag coverage by branch
    - reorient feature flag page to show flags that are active AND implemented
    - Opportunity: Allow debugging integrations to be added and do issue tracking related to possible active feature flags
    - stretch goal? CI implementation that allows people to check flags in code deployment against what’s active + exists



### Objective: Launch Direct SQL Querying Beta

* **Key Result:**
 * 5 beta users who retain for 3 weeks
* **Key Result:**
 * Understand the possible product directions to extend direct sql querying

* **Rationale:**
 * To fully support our technical users, we need to allow them to ask any sort of question about their data that might not be fit for an interface

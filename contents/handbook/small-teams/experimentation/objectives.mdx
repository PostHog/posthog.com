### Objective: Make feature flags incredible to use for customers with 3-15 engineers ([currently we have](https://app.posthog.com/insights/Bmz6U0tS) 10 customers with 3+ engineers who have created a feature flag in the last 30 days)

- **Key Result:** Launch remaining major platforms (with large marketing support to further drive adoption)
    - iOS
    - Android
    - Flutter
- **Key Result:** 5 happy teams on permission and alerting features
    - alerting/notification hooks to slack
    - access control
    - prevent accidental rollouts - 100% rollout should be loud and clear
- **Key Result:** 5 happy teams using feature flags based on cohorts
    - bulk add emails to cohorts
    - view cohorts by organization
    - edit static cohorts
    - cohort creation improvement, flexible user additions
    - cohorts by groups
- **Key Result:** Release beta of developer integrated features with 5 users
    - connect codebase and show feature flag coverage by branch
    - reorient feature flag page to show flags that are active AND implemented
    - Opportunity: Allow debugging integrations to be added and do issue tracking related to possible active feature flags
    - (stretch goal) CI implementation that allows people to check flags in code deployment against what's active + exists

* **Rationale:**
    * We want feature flags to be used across larger engineering teams. Currently we aren't solving their needs fully but we have a clear path to doing so.

### Objective: Launch Direct SQL Querying Beta

* **Key Result:**
     * 5 beta users who retain for 3 weeks
* **Key Result:**
     * Understand the possible product directions to extend direct sql querying

* **Rationale:**
     * To fully support our technical users, we need to allow them to ask any sort of question about their data that might not be fit for an interface

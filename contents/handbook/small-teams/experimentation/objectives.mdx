### Objective: Increase deployability of Feature Flags

* **Rationale:**
     * Feature flags is a high friction feature. Unlike adding a snippet or simple line to track an event, engineers and product owners need to plan for their product to work with the flag on and off. 
     To fully enable engineers to build with feature flags, we should make it remarkably easy to create flags.
 
- **Key Result:** Activation rate of users using flags by 20% (Base metric TBD)
- **Key Result:** TBD
    
Possible avenues:
- Auto detection of feature flags being sent that don't have a corresponding flag in posthog and easy creation (like github asking for branch to PR)
- API Enablement. Create experiments or feature flags using posthog API.
- Better hook and time to deployment with feature flag creation when someone lands on the feature flag page
- Less related but important: JSON flags, feature flag resiliency

### Objective: Understand similarities between users throughout posthog

* **Rationale:**
     * Help engineers stay focused on building. Give them as close to the answers and insights as possible with ample proof and dropoff points for further exploration.
 
- **Key Result:** Internal discoveries around different segments of users and groups
- **Key Result:** 

 Possible avenues:
- Cohort correlation. What are property and behavioral similarities between users in this cohort
- Experiment correlation. What are property and behavioral similarities between successful and failing variants


### Objective: Nail feature analysis

- **Key Result:** Our growth team is able to ship and draw conclusions painlessly on every feature being tested
- **Key Result:** TBD

* **Rationale:**
     * We have internal power users on the growth team who actively find value in deploying with experiments. Making the act of quick insights for features seamless sets us up to deliver an opinionated workflow

Possible avenues:
- Complete visibility into who's seeing a flag enabled feature. See recordings connected with users
- Clarity around how users are bucketed in experiments. How do release conditions relate to control vs variants and how do variant overrides relate to those?
- Experiments UX (pushed from last Q)

### Possible Objective: Direct SQL Querying

- **Key Result:** TBD
- **Key Result:** TBD

* **Rationale:**
     * To support users who want to ask free formed questions about their event and user data.

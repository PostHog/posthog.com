### Objective: Make it easier for engineers to analyze the success of a feature

PostHog’s customers are growth stage startups who don’t really care about specific feature release rules and schedules, but they do care about launching successful features. We want to give them the tools and recommendations to learn faster whether a feature is successful or not.

We aren't yet sure how this looks like, and have opted not to write down concrete features here yet. We'll run experiments, iterate, figure out what sticks, and re-orient if we realise this isn't something people want.

We would have achieved this objective when
- People start their analysing journey with ‘feature success’, rather than an insight/dashboard
- We publish a case study of a customer loving feature success
- This feature itself helps us answer if it's successful


### Objective: Launch experiments and feature flags with pricing

The next stage of our feature flags and experiments products is turning them into stand-alone verticals. We are going to launch pricing, which raises the bar for what's acceptable and drives us towards creating a more polished product. This also helps us learn more about what users are really missing, since they'll be more vocal about things they need.

To make this happen, we have four things to focus on:
- Make pricing proposal and support growth team where required with implementation
- Support marketing and website team to make sure our content is world-class
- Make Experiments UI feature complete
- Figure out how a flags-first onboarding flow looks like

We would have achieved this objective when we can create a PostHog account and pay only for flags/experiments.

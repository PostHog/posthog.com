## Who are we building for?

### Personas

- Primary Personas:
    - **Technical Founder**
        - First technical person at the company, responsible for setting up the initial landing page.
        - At an early stage, wants tools that initially cost little to nothing, but won't need to be replaced as the company grows.
    - **Product engineer**
        - These are the engineers building the product. Normally full-stack engineers skewing frontend or frontend engineers. 
        - Product engineers have more limited time. Need to quickly get high-quality insights to inform what they are building and assess what they've shipped.

- Not a focus but should be usable by:
    - Other engineers
    - Marketing
    - Everyone in the product team (PMs, designers)
    - Non-technical leadership

### What types of companies?

We want to build something that will convince our existing large (20k+) customers to turn PostHog on on their marketing website.

### Jobs to be done

Web analytics is an _opinionated_ tool, that will help people:

- Measure and improve the effectiveness of their acquisition strategy
- Measure and improve the effectiveness of their conversion funnels
- Understand who is using their website
- Understand how their website is being used
- Create simple-to-medium complexity combinations of these (e.g. how likely are people who came in from this ad to convert, compared to everyone else)

Additionally, it should be:

- Easy to set up
- Easy to use
- It's ok if that means we don't cover every use case, as people who need more can use [product analytics](/handbook/small-teams/product-analytics)

## Roadmap

### 3 year goals
* Be useful for the best high growth companies right from the start
* Lead companies into other PostHog products as they start to need them, massively boosting them
* Run on cheap and fast infrastructure
* Can scale to the biggest websites in the world
* Solve the extremely common problem of marketing and product using completely siloed data stacks

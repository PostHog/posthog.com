## Small teams

We've organised the team into small teams that are multi-disciplinary. [You can read about why we've done it this way](/handbook/company/small-teams).

### Engineering

Engineering is spread out into three small teams. Team Platform is a scope-specific team which focuses on deployments and ingestion (see [Team Platform](/handbook/small-teams/infrastructure) for more details). App teams East and West work on the PostHog product in general and they're split based on timezones for optimal collaboration. We mostly hire full-stack engineers and each team has expertise across the stack of the entire product. To learn what each team is working on you can take a look at [feature ownership](/handbook/engineering/feature-ownership).

## Organization changes

We’re still an early stage company, and so is our product. We strongly value moving and shipping fast (see [core values](/handbook/company/values)) and we constantly iterate not only our product but our organization too. As this happens, it may be quite possible that organizational changes occur. This mostly happens on the [small teams](/handbook/company/small-teams) plane. To make the changes smoother for everyone, here’s the checklist we use:

- [ ] Discuss with relevant team leads (and/or managers if applicable).
- [ ] Discuss with relevant team member(s).
- [ ] Open a PR on `posthog.com` documenting the change on the handbook.
    - [ ] Update the [Team structure](/handbook/small-teams/team-structure) page.
- [ ] Let everyone else in the company know in the next PostHog News session.
- [ ] Add/remove from relevant [Sentry teams](https://sentry.io/settings/posthog/teams/).
- [ ] Add/remove from relevant [GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams).
- [ ] Add/remove from Slack `@` groups / team mentions (e.g. `@core-experience`).


### Team Lead checklist
- [ ] Onboarding 1:1 with new team member.
- [ ] Add to stand-ups, planning sessions, and any other team rituals.
- [ ] Update Slack channel description, and invite to Slack channel if needed.

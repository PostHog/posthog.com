## Small teams

We've organised the team into small teams that are multi-disciplinary and as self-sufficient as possible. [You can read about why we've done it this way](/handbook/company/small-teams).

Our small teams are:

- [Product Analytics](/handbook/small-teams/product-analytics)
- [Experimentation](/handbook/small-teams/experimentation)
- [Session Recording](/handbook/small-teams/session-recording)
- [Infrastructure](/handbook/small-teams/infrastructure)
- [Pipeline](/handbook/small-teams/pipeline)
- [Marketing](/handbook/small-teams/marketing)
- [Website and Docs](/handbook/small-teams/website-docs)
- [Growth](/handbook/small-teams/growth)
- [People & Ops](/handbook/small-teams/people)
- [Customer Success](/handbook/small-teams/customer-success)
- [Exec](/handbook/small-teams/exec)

## Reporting lines

We maintain our full org chart in Roots, [which you can access here](https://app.tryroots.io/org-chart).

Team leads do not necessarily = managers - read more about how we think about management [here](/handbook/company/management). 

## Organization changes

We’re still an early stage company, and so is our product. We strongly value moving and shipping fast (see [core values](/handbook/company/values)) and we constantly iterate not only our product but our organization too. As this happens, it may be quite possible that organizational changes occur. This mostly happens at the [small teams](/handbook/company/small-teams) level. To make the changes smoother for everyone, here’s the checklist we use:

- [ ] Discuss with relevant team leads (and/or managers if applicable).
- [ ] Discuss with relevant team member(s).
- [ ] Open a PR on `posthog.com` documenting the change on the handbook.
    - [ ] Update the [Team structure](/handbook/small-teams/team-structure) page.
- [ ] Let everyone else in the company know in the next PostHog News session.
- [ ] Add/remove from relevant [Sentry teams](https://sentry.io/settings/posthog/teams/).
- [ ] Add/remove from relevant [GitHub teams](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/teams).
- [ ] Add/remove from Slack `@` groups / team mentions (e.g. `@core-experience`).

### Team Lead checklist
- [ ] Onboarding 1:1 with new team member.
- [ ] Add to stand-ups, planning sessions, and any other team rituals.
- [ ] Update Slack channel description, and invite to Slack channel if needed.

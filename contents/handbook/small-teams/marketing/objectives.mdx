* **Objective**:
    * Expand PostHog’s top of funnel awareness across all our core _individual_ products - product analytics, session recording, feature flags, and A/B testing.

* **Key Results:**
    * Increase [overall weekly website traffic](https://app.posthog.com/insights/hg6kfoIG) to 27k unique visitors per week (filtering out viral spikes).
    * Increase [‘first user in org’ signups](https://app.posthog.com/insights/EwWz7QuV) to 600 per week without decreasing the percentage that are ICPs (20-25%).
    * Make Tutorials our [3rd most visited section](https://app.posthog.com/insights/n8b9SHgd) (after Docs and Blogs)
    * Increase number of [subscribers](https://newsletter.posthog.com/publish/subscribers) to Product for Engineers to 1,500
    * Get [200 orgs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ryDGzXcG0OSH-GoX-zlI2CKwNu-6Zivi7EM32WLdids/edit#gid=0) to sign up to the startup deal
    * Increase [28 day YouTube watch time](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCn4mJ4kK5KVSvozJre645LA?c=UCn4mJ4kK5KVSvozJre645LA) to 227 hours

* **Rationale:**
    * We frequently get brand mentions where people are saying ‘Amplitude, Mixpanel or PostHog’. We want them to also say things like ‘LaunchDarkly or PostHog’, ‘FullStory or PostHog’, and 'Optimizely or PostHog'.
    * While SEO remains very important to us, we want to diversify our audience slightly so we are not so dependent on it as a single channel as a defensive move, especially if there are AI-related changes to search in future. Building things like our newsletter, YouTube channel, and our startup community will help us do this. 
    * While tutorials often do not drive top of funnel awareness for people who have never heard of PostHog, they will help drive awareness of _other products_ once users are signed up to PostHog. 

* **Anti-goals** 
    * Trying a new channel. Working on community. Working with developer influencers. TikTok.

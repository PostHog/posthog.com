* **Objective**:
    * Nail our marketing engine. 

* **Key Results:**
    * Increase overall weekly website traffic to 20k unique visitors per week (filtering out viral spikes).
    * Increase ‘first user in org’ signups to 500 per week without decreasing the percentage that are ICPs (typically 20-25%).
    * Get 80 signups each week to say they first heard about us from any of YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and TikTok.
    * Get 20% of the W23 YC batch to sign up for the YC deal - estimate this will be approx. 80 companies.

* **Rationale:**
    * Last quarter we tried a lot of experimental stuff. Some of these things are quite promising, others are not. We should now do a better job at the things we know are working and take them from amateur hour to slick. 

* **Anti-goals** 
    * Trying a new channel. Working on community. Working with developer influencers.

* **Goal**:
    * Get twice as good at everything we’re already doing.

*  **Projects**
   * Win half of the W24 batch and double the size of the startups program (Joe)
   * Double the number of newsletter subs again while maintaining 45% open rate (Ian)
   * Every time you search ‘alternative to X’, PostHog appears high up in Google Search (Andy)
   * Every time you search for content related to PostHog’s products, we appear high up in Google Search (Lior)
   * Ship new high end merch that people post about online (Lottie)
   * Do billboards so distinctive that people post them online (Lottie)
   * Do a cool influencer campaign with Theo (Ian)
* **Don’t get worse at any of these things**
   * Paid ads (Charles)
   * Docs, Tutorials, and Hub (Andy, Ian, Lior)
   * Attribution (Charles)
   * Twitter (Charles talk to James - we can do regular posting on the PosHog account but do we want to keep working on James’ personal account?)

* **Rationale:**
   * We have built enough confidence to know that the core things we are doing are working. It feels like the right time to push the accelerator. 
   * Having (quite reasonably) not spent as much time focusing on SEO this year, it is worth doing a temporary ‘commercial’ push in Q4, especially now that multiple products outside of analytics have reached maturity. We want to stay proactive in hitting our revenue goals - if we fall behind, we may feel pressure to take poor long-term decisions. 
   * At the same time, we want to continue to de-risk our reliance on a small number of SEO articles (see recent algo changes) by diversifying across multiple channels. Startups, newsletter and merch are important parts of this. 
   * This means treating the content hub as business as usual in terms of posting weekly, but not pushing ideas to make it 10/10 in Q4. 
   * Spending more time on SEO means dropping something else - Andy and Charles suggest that this should be James' Twitter. 

* **Output metrics we care about**
    * New org signups
    * Organic SEO users
    * Newsletter signups 

* **Anti-goals** 
    * TikTok
    * Podcasts
    * Going deep on YouTube
    * Solving support

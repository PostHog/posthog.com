**Goal**
Increase the number of people signing up for PostHog's products beyond Product Analytics.

**Rationale**
In Q4 2023, we tried a few new things and started measuring impact more seriously. We have a lot more confidence in what works well (and have covered a lot of bases with existing products), so we should use this to make products beyond analytics successful.

**Projects**
- Complete our ‘Alternatives to X’ SEO content coverage for feature flags, experimentation, and session replay (Andy)
- Make sure we have good ‘getting started’ content (Joe)
- Write tutorials for all our key frameworks and products (Lior)
- Increase newsletter subs from 6k to 10k (Andy)
- Repeat our success with Theo on TikTok with new influencers (Ian)
- Rework all our paid ads copy now we’ve cut back to just Google Search (Charles)
- Get 50% of the W24 batch to sign up (Joe)
- Make sure we keep measuring impact regularly for all of our content (Everyone)
- Book all the billboards and/or other out-of-home spots we want for a January 2025 campaign (Lottie)

**Anti-goals**
- Building a community (Website & Docs are working on this)
- Getting good at social media (maintaining steady state for now)
- Leading events (but we'll help CS a bit)

**Output metrics we care about**
- New org signups
- Newsletter signups

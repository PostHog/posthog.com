* **Objective**:
    * Become an authority and vital resource on building successful products.

* **Goals:**
    * Nail Twitter for content distribution (**Owner:** Andy)
    * Make PostHog for Startups the default choice for technical founders (**Owner:** Joe)
    * Scale the newsletter to thousands of engaged subscribers (**Owner:** Andy)
    * Create a hub of non-PostHog product engineering content (**Owner:** Ian)
    * Ship printed PMF guide with a distribution plan (**Owner:** Lottie)
    * Improve the docs and tutorials (**Owner:** Lior)

* **Rationale:**
    * Previously we've set metric-centric goals. This made sense when business-as-usual work drove growth easily, but we feel marketing and content needs to become more mission driven to drive long-term bottom-up growth. We still monitor several metrics, but we treat them as indicators of progress rather than discrete goals.

    * Our gut instinct is that, while community is a very hard problem to solve, getting it right might be the thing that unlocks our next surge in growth. An engaged and happpy community is a stimulant for word-of-mouth growth. The longer we wait, the harder it'll be to make it work. Community is not a monolith – it includes all sorts of dimensions, including social, content, and direct engagement via Slack, the website etc.

    * Paid ads fall under business-as-usual. We're working towards making paid ad spend as lean as possible, so we can divert budget to other more leveraged activities.

    * Some of our goals are long term – i.e. we don't expect to "complete" all them in Q3, but progress them as effectively as possible, and continue on into the future.

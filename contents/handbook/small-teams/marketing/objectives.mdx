* **Objective**:
    * Double down on the channels that work, and find new ones to expand into. 

* **Key Results:**
    * Existing: Average 700 new org signups per week (40% increase, same as Q2 to Q3).  
    * Existing: Increase organic Google SEO traffic to 6,000 pageviews per week (33% increase, same as Q2 to Q3).
    * New: Properly test developer influencers as a channel, and get at least 10 signups per week we can attribute to this channel. 
    * New: Properly test Twitter, and get at least 10 signups per week we can attribute to this channel. 

* **Rationale:**
    * Let’s keep going. We have validated that the first two are good ‘honest’ metrics for word of mouth growth, and there are lots of ways that we can influence them. In order to maintain and accelerate growth, we should start testing new channels beyond content, and build conviction on where to invest future time and resources.

* **Objective**:
    * Increase word-of-mouth growth by:
      1. Showcasing new features by acting as the newsroom of PostHog
      2. Being an authority and vital resource on building successful products.

* **Goals:**
    * Nail Twitter and content distribution (**Owner:** Charles)
    * Make PostHog for Startups the default choice for technical founders (**Owner:** Joe)
    * Scale the newsletter to thousands of engaged subscribers (**Owner:** Andy)
    * Create and execute a community roadmap (**Owner:** Lior)
    * Ship printed PMF guide with a distribution plan (**Owner:** Lottie)
    * Continue to grow SEO traffic and improve docs (**Owners:** Andy, Ian & Lior)

* **Rationale:**
    * Previously we've set metric-centric goals. This made sense when business-as-usual work drove growth easily, but we feel marketing and content needs to become more mission driven to drive long-term bottom-up growth. We still monitor several metrics, but we treat them as indicators of progress rather than discrete goals.

    * Our gut instinct is that, while community is a very hard problem to solve, getting it right might be the thing that unlocks our next surge in growth. An engaged and happpy community is a stimulant for word-of-mouth growth. The longer we wait, the harder it'll be to make it work.

    * Paid ads fall under business-as-usual. We're working towards making paid ad spend as lean as possible, so we can divert budget to other more leveraged activities.

    * Some of our goals are long term – i.e. we don't expect to "complete" all them in Q3, but progress them as effectively as possible, and continue on into the future.

* **Output metrics we care about**
    * New org signups
    * Website unique users
    * ICP signups
    * Organic SEO users
    * Newsletter signups 

* **Anti-goals** 
    * TikTok
    * Podcasts
    * Going deep on YouTube
    * Solving support

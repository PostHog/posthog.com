* **Objective**:
    * Increase word-of-mouth growth by becoming an authority on building successful products, and ensuring community members have a great experience

* **Goals: (DRAFT)**
    * Nail Twitter and content distribution (Owner: TBD, maybe Charles?)
    * Nail internal content discovery and engagement (Owner: Ian with Website & Docs)
    * Make PostHog for Startups the default choice for technical founders (Owner: Joe)
    * Scale the newsletter to thousands of engaged subscribers (Owner: Andy)
    * Create and execute a community plan (Owner: Lior)
    * Ship printed PMF guide with a distribution plan (Owner: Lottie)

* **Rationale:**
    * Previously we've set metric-centric goals. This made sense when everything we were doing was driving growth easily, but we feel marketing and content needs to become more mission driven to drive long-term bottom-up growth. We still monitor several metrics, but we treat them as indicators of progress rather than discrete goals.
    * Our gut instinct is that, while community is a very hard problem to solve, getting it right might be the thing that unlocks our next surge in growth. An engaged and happpy community is a stimulant for word-of-mouth growth. The longer we wait, the harder it'll be to work.
    * Improving docs and growing SEO content are BAU tasks we're always progressing alongside our wider quarterly goals. We track output metrics to ensure we're not neglecting this work. All content writers are expected to contribute.
    * Paid ads also fall under BAU, but we also want to ensure they are as lean as possible we can divert budget to other more leveraged activities.
    * Some of our goals are long term â€“ i.e. we don't expect to "complete" all them in Q3, but progress them as effectively as possible, and continue on into the future.

* **Output metrics we care about (DRAFT)**

* **Anti-goals (DRAFT)**

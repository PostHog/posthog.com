* **Objective**:
    * Nail our marketing engine. 

* **Key Results:**
    * Increase [overall weekly website traffic](https://app.posthog.com/insights/hg6kfoIG) to 20k unique visitors per week (filtering out viral spikes).
    * Increase [‘first user in org’ signups](https://app.posthog.com/insights/EwWz7QuV) to 500 per week without decreasing the percentage that are ICPs (typically 20-25%).
    * Get 80 signups each week to say [they first heard about us](https://app.posthog.com/insights/jdJgByZC) from any of YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
    * Get 20% of the W23 YC batch to [sign up for the YC deal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions?price=price_1MSKjrEuIatRXSdz9W5ExGys) - estimate this will be approx. 50 companies.

* **Rationale:**
    * Last quarter we tried a lot of experimental stuff. Some of these things are quite promising, others are not. We should now do a better job at the things we know are working and take them from amateur hour to slick. 

* **Anti-goals** 
    * Trying a new channel. Working on community. Working with developer influencers.

### Objective

The data warehouse that PostHog is built on should scale with us in every environment as we grow in users and in products.

* **Key Results:**
    * EU and US have no downtime (only lag) and we have scaled to meet demand of every customer.

We enable our users to better leverage the data they have in PostHog by allowing them to bring their own data.

* **Key Results:**
    * We have a product that delays the need to hire a Data Engineer and is compatible with Data Engineers.
    * Users are creating tables on PostHog and augmenting our PostHog models with data from those tables.

## Q1 2023 Goals

- Objective: Reduce TOIL
  - KR: Migrate PostgreSQL out of Heroku and into the correct AWS account
    - Why? Reduce cost and reduce risk of us maxing out the instance
  - KR: Consolidate infrastructure into the correct AWS accounts (specifically US)
    - Why? This will reduce the toil and AWS expenses
- Objective: Support other teams and enable other teams to self-serve
  - KR: Most of the pipeline team has written/contributed to their own alerting system
    - Once the system is set up well, would be good to get the other teams doing this too
    - Why? Enable the pipeline team to self-serve their issues
  - Metric to track: % of non-infra hero time supporting other teams  
- Objective: Keep infra spend flat at $120k/month
  - Such as [Guidoâ€™s list](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/13153)
  - *Will likely decrease cost first then increase with usage*
  - Why? Improving our gross profit margin

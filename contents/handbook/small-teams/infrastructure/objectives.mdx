## Q4 2022 Goals

- Objective: Migrate PostgreSQL out of Heroku and into the correct AWS account
  - Why? Reduce cost and reduce risk of us maxing out the instance
- Objective: Most of the pipeline team has written/contributed to their own alerting system
  - Once the system is set up well, would be good to get the other teams doing this too
  - Why? Enable the pipeline team to self-serve their issues
- Objective: Consolidate infrastructure into the correct AWS accounts (specifically US)
  - Why? This will reduce the toil and AWS expenses
- Objective: Keep infra spend flat at $120k/month
  - Such as [Guido’s list](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/13153)
  - *Will likely decrease cost first then increase with usage*
  - Why? Improving our gross profit margin

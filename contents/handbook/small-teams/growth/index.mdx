  - Help product teams leverage the tooling to create best-in-class onboarding & activation flows for their products
  - Improve cross-product pollination

  - Billing infrastructure
  - Pricing & self-serve revenue (in collaboration with each product team)
  - Revenue reporting
- Internal metrics reporting (company scorecard)


## Q2 2023 objectives

- **Objective 1**: We can easily run experiments on pricing
  - Reasoning: Pricing is the most important factor in success for PostHog, and getting a framework in place to run experiments on pricing itself will allow us to figure out what works best.
  - **KR**: An iteration or experiment on pricing takes 1-2 pull requests, and solves grandfathering smoothly
  - **KR**: We can run the experiments we outlined previously.
- **Objective 2**: Each paid product is positioned as a first-class citizen within our onboarding and upgrade flows
  - Reasoning: PostHog is no longer Product Analytics++, but it still feels that way when you first sign up. Customers who come in for a different product need to feel like PostHog will serve their needs.
  - **KR**: We see similar activation rates between those who sign up for Product Analytics vs Session Recordings.
    - We will need to start collecting (or inferring) this info on sign up so we can compare.
  - **KR**: We hear from 3 customers who signed up for something _other_ than Product Analytics that the product they signed up for didn't feel like an add-on to Product Analytics.
    - This will be via customer interviews scheduled with people who very recently signed up for something other than product analytics.

Current status of the Activation metrics can be checked on the [Growth dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/dashboard/54139) (internal only)

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the Growth team can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

## Q1 2024 objectives

- **Objective 1**: Double activation rates for product analytics and session replay
  - Reasoning: Activation is lower than we'd like it to be, and activation is a leading indicator for retention and revenue
  - **KR**: 2 customer interviews per week
  - **KR**: Start 1 new experiment every week
- **Objective 2**: Launch pricing for Data warehouse, queries, CDP
  - Reasoning: Customers get lots of value out of these and should be charged accordingly
  - **KR**: Cost of collaboration doesn't feel too high

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the Growth team can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

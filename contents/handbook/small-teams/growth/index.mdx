## Mission

PostHog's company growth targets are met every quarter

## Q4 2022 Objective
Start charging for session recordings resulting in a $100K increase in ARR from new customers (joint goal with [Session Recording team](/handbook/small-teams/session-recording))

## What the Growth team does

Each month, the Growth and [Exec team](/handbook/small-teams/exec) carry on a [Growth review session](/handbook/growth/growth-engineering/growth-sessions) to accelerate growth work, as well as define tasks for the Growth team.

The Growth team focuses on Activation metrics, namely:

- Signup activation rate: User has signup to the product -> User has successfully discovered the product's value
- Card activation rate: User has inserted their card details
- Paid activation rate: User has converted to a paying customer

The team is primarily responsible for the following areas:

- Signup flow
- Onboarding and integrating PostHog with the customer's product
- Billing and card activation flows
- Messaging, emailing and notifications

Current status of the Activation metrics can be checked on the [Growth dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/dashboard/54139) (internal only)

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the Growth team can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

## People

<TeamMembers />

## Mission

Maximize the number of people who get value out of PostHog, and help them realize and leverage all the value we offer.

## What the Growth team does

- Sign up
- Activation and reducing time to value
- Billing and pricing changes
- Product led growth, including messaging, emailing and notifications

## Q1 2023 objectives

- **Objective 1**: Feel confident in our definitions and metrics for all our areas of responsibility
  - Reasoning: So that we know we are looking at the right things and can prioritize future work
  - **KR**: 1 dashboard with 1 insight for each area of responsibility
  - **KR**: 1 dashboard for each area of responsibility, and insights that describe the entire flow
- **Objective 2**: Improve conversion to paid
  - Reasoning: This metric directly impacts our company performance, and it encompasses many things downstream (eg. activation, billing conversion, etc).
  - *KR*: Sign up-> paid anything from 1.6% to 5% (3 month average).
    - Idea: Each sub-product has its own onboarding flow with in-app tutorials/videos
    - Idea: All the docs, tutorials and product material is accessible from within the app
- **Objective 3**: We can iterate quickly on pricing
  - Reasoning: Pricing is the most important factor in success for PostHog, and getting a smooth process to make pricing changes will allow us to iterate more.
  - **KR**: An iteration or experiment on pricing takes 1-2 pull requests, and solves grandfathering smoothly

Current status of the Activation metrics can be checked on the [Growth dashboard](https://app.posthog.com/dashboard/54139) (internal only)

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the Growth team can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

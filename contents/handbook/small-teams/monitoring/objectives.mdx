# ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1 : Project "NoteForce Exploration 3000" (Ben, David)

Why? Pairing up with Michael and Thomas from Team Product Anyalytics to focus on not just releasing Notebooks, but integrating them seemlessly with PostHog 3000 to make it a great experience to explor any data across PostHog.


# ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2 : Mobile Session Replay

Why? - The people want it and we have the right skills in house to do a good job of this. Replay is the overriding focus, but making mobile a first-class citizen of PostHog is the real goal.

### Goal 1 - Finish the 80:20 of Session Replay

**Why?** - The core product of this team, we want to ensure that it works well and is available to our customers. We have a lot of other things we want to do but we need to make sure we have a solid foundation to build on. At a minimum this covers our new ingestion and storage system, the V2 of our recording JS and the ability to record on mobile.

### Goal 2 - Notebooks MVP

**Why?** - We proved to ourselves that our Notebooks concept is a strong way to tie multiple areas of PostHog together. Getting this foundational feature up and running will allow us and the community to build it further and extend PostHog.

### Goal 3 - Errors MVP

**Why?** - We know that one of the strongest use cases for Replay is to understand what the user experience and journey was leading up to an exception. With the platform of PostHog we are well placed to build out a strong error tracking and analysis product, tightly integrated with the rest of PostHog.

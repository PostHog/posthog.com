# ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1 : Project "NoteForce Exploration 3000" (Ben, David)

Why? Pairing up with Michael and Thomas from Team Product Analytics to focus on not just releasing Notebooks, but integrating them seamlessly with PostHog 3000 to make it a great experience to explore any and all data across PostHog.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2 : Mobile Session Replay

Why? - The people want it and we have the right skills in house to do a good job of this. Replay is the main focus, but making mobile a first-class citizen of PostHog is the real goal.

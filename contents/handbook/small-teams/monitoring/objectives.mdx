# ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1 : Notebooks on ProductHunt

Why? - We are building more and more of the Product OS and covering a wider range of product engineering tools. The challenge is in bringing all these things together. We trialled the concept and are sure this is the way to go. Now it's about making a slick experience where you can explore all of PostHog's content in one place, collaborate and share with others.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2 : Next 5 great things for Replay

Why? - We have users who love Replay and have it as a core part of their workflows. We want to work on the top 5 most impactful changes based on what the community is asking for. Notebooks will partially improve things by allowing commenting and collaboration but it is not the only thing that could make Replay even better.

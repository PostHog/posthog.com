## Q3 2023 Goals

1. Port all our insights over to HogQL.
- make it possible to graph/chart/funnel _other_ data than just events (see: data warehouse)
- adds a "to sql" button above every insight, giving users tools to investigate data integrity issues without involving support
- makes it much easier to connect pieces of data in the app (persons modal -> show events not persons)
- makes partially implemented features available across all insights (e.g. there's STILL no group name breakdowns in trends...)
- makes it possible for insights on notebooks to be interlinked jupiter style (e.g. `select from {previous_chart_results} join {other_chart_results}`)

2. Sleeker insight editor UI
- make insight filters compatible with PostHog 3000
- make insight filters compatible with notebooks
- consider a HogQL-powered "GUI" for multi-breakdowns
- involve other app teams early

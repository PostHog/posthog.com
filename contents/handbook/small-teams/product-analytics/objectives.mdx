## Q1 2023 Goals

### Objective 1: Ship PostHog 3000 UX. 10 happy ICP beta customers.

- Why? Subjectively, we believe there are many UI/UX improvements to make it a tool that product engineers love.

- Key results:
  - We have shipped the core elements of PostHog 3000 that we believe are most impactful. This can be tabs, dark mode, a new query editor. TBD
  - (Likely Q2) Ship notebooks - making it seamless to explore product questions in PostHog. Build with 5 happy beta customers
    - Why? This should enable faster and more structured data exploration. The data exploration work this quarter unlocks this as a key workflow.

### Objective 2: Make PostHog performance frustration free for our 10 largest customers

- Key results:
  - For top 10 US&EU clients p95 of dashboard load time <5s 
  - For top 10 US&EU clients p95 of insight load time <5s
  - Rough roadmap
    - Some sample projects: rethinking timeouts, data sampling, re-schemaing. TBD
    - Create plan for handling 10x larger customer and increasing redundancy from only Karl

### Objective: Systematically prevent regressions across PostHog Part 2

- Why? A number of users (including Simon and Cameron during demos) often experience regressions when using PostHog. This damages the experience and is problematic for the $20k+/year ICPs we are targeting
- Key results:
  - There are no demos that are interrupted by bugs
  - There are no known ways of combining query options in a way that fails (query tests)
  - Create a dashboard that tracks product quality in an objective way
  - Other ideas:
    - Automated rollout (internal, beta, hobbyists, paying then ICP)? Automated testing? Visual regression testing? QA tester? Proper issue tracking and triaging system? Create a system for triaging bugs and solving them?

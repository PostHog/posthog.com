## Who are we building for?

### Personas

- Primary Personas:
    - **Product engineer**
        - These are the engineers building the product. Normally full-stack engineers skewing frontend or frontend engineers. 
        - Product engineers have more limited time. Need to quickly get high-quality insights to inform what they are building and assess what they've shipped.
    - **Product manager** (ex-engineer type)
        - Supports the product teams (engineers, PMs, designers) to build the best products. They guide the product roadmap by speaking to customers and diving into the data.
        - Product managers are the power-users of analytics (further evidence in the data analysis of paying users). They have desire and the time to go significantly deeper into the data.
- Limited focus:
    - Growth engineer
- Not a focus but should be usable by:
    - Everyone in the product team (less technical PMs, designers)
    - Marketing
    - Leadership team

### What types of companies?

The highest-performing product teams building the most loved products at **high-growth startups**. For more context on the company read about the [ideal customer persona](/handbook/strategy/ideal-customer-persona).

### Jobs to be done

Product analytics is a _wide_ tool which fulfills many job-to-be-done (non-exhaustive list):

- Monitoring KPIs - how are the specific KPIs (product/team/company) doing? Are there any big changes, is everything going roughly in the right direction?
- Insights into a new feature you've built - I've created a new feature and I want to make sure that it's being used successfully
- Watching for errors and debugging - something went wrong (error gets trigger, product regression, drop in conversion), getting told it went wrong, debugging it, shipping a solution and making sure that fixes it
- Conversion optimization - the growth team is monitoring how particular KPIs are doing, trying to come up with experiments, shipping features to try and improve these
- Answering product strategy questions - which customers should we focus on, what are our most used/valued features. e.g. should we increase the pricing from X to Y? Which customers should we focus on?

You can broadly group the job-to-be-done of Product Analytics in PostHog as:

- **Creating**: You have a specific query/dashboard in mind, you open PostHog to view it. E.g. creating a dashboard to Monitor KPIs, or creating the funnel for your onboarding flow
- **Consuming**: you or someone else has made something in Posthog that you refer back to. E.g. Checking the dashboard you made to Monitor KPIs
- **Exploring**: you're answering a broader open-ended question. E.g. If you're monitoring your KPIs and you see something not right - you then want to dive into understanding why

## Roadmap

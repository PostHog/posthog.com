## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people, operations, and culture. This is what we care about:

- Setting a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for _the_ best people in their field, or people on their way to becoming exceptional at their jobs. This is so important to us, it's enshrined in our [values](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#talent-compounds).
- Supporting our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from [making an offer](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation), to [onboarding](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/onboarding) and [career development](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/feedback), [parental leave](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/time-off), and eventually [parting ways](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation). 
- We create light-touch initiatives, systems, and processes that allow PostHog to act fast and [scale iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration) 
- Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) with a strong sense of belonging is at the heart of everything we do. It's so important to us, we have a dedicated [handbook page](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/diversity).

## Tools

An operations team is never complete without a robust toolkit to allow us to automate processes and multiply our impact. Here is a summary of some of the tools we've found most effective for getting the job done. You can read more about why we chose them [here](https://posthog.com/blog/startup-ops-toolkit).

### Hiring

#### **Contracts & Offer Letters**

- All templates are stored in the _Legal Docs [CONFIDENTIAL]_ shared Google Drive, in the _Team_ folder. 
- To avoid emailing PDFs back and forth forever, we use the e-signature platform [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com/).

#### **HR, Recruiting, and Payroll**

- [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/) - platform for managing all permanent US employees, including contracts, healthcare and payroll. 
  - We use [Middesk](https://www.middesk.com/) to manage all our state registrations and filings on our behalf. 
  - For managing our US 401(k) we use [Pentegra](https://www.pentegra.com/), which requires a manual [monthly reporting process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hgCDpI280xbor75LyGUFmwjr_AVx3n-F57Iz_-YhNaA/edit?usp=sharing). However, we will be exploring more self-serve options in the future as we now have Operations team members in the US who can act as company fiduciaries.
- [Deel](https://www.letsdeel.com/) - platform for managing all employees outside the US and UK (using their EOR service), and all contractors globally. 
- UK contracts are currently done manually in Google Drive, with payroll also being run manually. 
- [CharlieHR](https://www.charliehr.com/) - used to store all team personal details, documents, pay and for booking any type of leave.
- [Ashby](https://ashbyhq.com) - our ATS for managing all recruitment (you can find their full documentation [here](https://www.notion.so/Ashby-University-efd04871f5554358ada837de165070ca).

#### **Finance and Banking**

- Accounting:
  - For the US, we use [Fondo](https://www.tryfondo.com). We have a shared Slack channel with them. 
  - For the UK, we use [DRG](https://www.donaldreid.co.uk/). Everything is managed by email. 
- Banking:
  - [Brex](https://www.brex.com/) is our main account, which we also use for team credit cards and expense management.
  - We have backup savings accounts with Mercury and SVB. 
- [Pry](http://pry.co/) (recently acquired by Brex) is our main financial planning tool. 
- [LTSE Equity](https://equity.ltse.com/) is where we manage our cap table. 
- [Anrok](https://anrok.com/) helps us stay on top of any state and local tax obligations triggered by employee presence or sales volume, and connects seamlessly and imports sales data from Stripe. They also provide automated support for registering with local tax authorities to automate the remittance process (though we don't use this part of their service yet). 

#### **Everything Else**

- For those pesky externalities, we use [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/) for all of our insurance coverage.
- A bit unusual for an operations team, we track everything in [GitHub](https://github.com/) from maintaining this handbook to sprint planning. You can find the People & Ops project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/2?fullscreen=true).

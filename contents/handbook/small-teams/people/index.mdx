## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people, operations, and culture. This is what we care about:

- Setting a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for _the_ best people in their field, or people on their way to becoming exceptional at their jobs. This is so important to us, it's enshrined in our [values](/handbook/company/values#talent-compounds).
- Supporting our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from [making an offer](/handbook/people/compensation), to [onboarding](/handbook/people/onboarding) and [progression](/handbook/people/career-progression), [time off](/handbook/people/time-off), and eventually [parting ways](/handbook/people/offboarding). 
- We create light-touch initiatives, systems, and processes that allow PostHog to act fast and [scale iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration) 
- Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) with a strong sense of belonging is at the heart of everything we do.

We use the RACI model to manage the various areas of focus within the team:
- **R = Responsible ie who is in charge of getting the work done**
- **A = Accountable ie who ensures that the work gets done**
- **C = Consulted ie who needs to be brought in on decisions**
- **I = Informed ie who needs to be told when decisions are made**

## Tools

Here is a summary of some of the tools we've found most effective for getting the job done. You can read more about why we chose them [here](https://posthog.com/blog/startup-ops-toolkit). Grace and/or Charles are top level admins for all of these, should you need access. 

### People Ops, Recruiting, and Payroll

- [Ashby](https://ashbyhq.com) - our ATS for managing all recruitment (you can find their full documentation [here](https://www.notion.so/Ashby-University-efd04871f5554358ada837de165070ca).
- [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/) - platform for managing all permanent US employees, including contracts, healthcare and payroll. 
  - We use [Middesk](https://www.middesk.com/) to manage all our state registrations and filings on our behalf. 
  - For managing our US 401(k) we use [Pentegra](https://www.pentegra.com/), which requires a manual [monthly reporting process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hgCDpI280xbor75LyGUFmwjr_AVx3n-F57Iz_-YhNaA/edit?usp=sharing). 
    - We are currently migrating to Guideline, which will take effect on Feb 1st 2023. 
- [Deel](https://www.letsdeel.com/) - platform for managing all team members outside the US and UK (using their EOR service in certain countries). 
- UK contracts are currently done manually in Google Drive, with payroll also being run manually - our accountants load up payments in Revolut for us to approve every month. All templates are stored in the _Legal Docs [CONFIDENTIAL]_ shared Google Drive, in the _Team_ folder. 
- US contracts are also done manually in Google Drive. 
- To avoid emailing PDFs back and forth forever, we use [PandaDoc](https://www.pandadoc.com/).
- [PTO by Deel](https://www.tryroots.io/pto) - Slack app for booking all types of time off. 
- [CharlieHR](https://www.charliehr.com/) - used to store all team personal details, documents, and pay. We are in the process of migrating this to Deel HR.

### Finance and Banking

Details can be found in `company-internal` [repo here](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/tree/master/finance) 

#### Everything Else

- [LTSE Equity](https://equity.ltse.com/) is where we manage our cap table. 
- For those pesky externalities, we use [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/) for all of our insurance coverage, including D&O, Cyber Liability, and Travel. 
- A bit unusual for an operations team, we track everything in [GitHub](https://github.com/) from maintaining this handbook to sprint planning. You can find the People & Ops project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/2?fullscreen=true).

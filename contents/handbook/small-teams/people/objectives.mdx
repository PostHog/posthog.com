* **Key Results:**
    * Hiring: Hire a Full Stack Engineer (Experimentation) and Product Designer
    * Hiring: Start reporting diversity of pipeline on a monthly basis
    * Culture: Run a whole team offsite that at least 80% of the team rate as 4/5
    * Culture: Set up regular team surveys and ensure at least 90% responsiveness
    * Finance: Ensure we stay within 5% of forecast cash burn
    * Finance: 100% of monthly reports are shared with the team before the end of the following month
    * Ops: Complete our SOC 2 audit and get certified.
* **Rationale:**
    * Our ops run smoothly already, so it doesn’t make sense to invest more time for marginal gains here. 
    * We should focus on making the experience of working at PostHog as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.

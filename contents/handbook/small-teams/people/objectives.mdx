* **Objective:**
    * Set the stage for 2024 to be PostHog’s best year ever.
* **Key Results:**
    * Ship Hedgehog OS, aka Handbook 2.0, so other companies can start copying _that_ instead of the old Handbook (Charles)
    * Get onto the Data Protection Framework list (Grace)
    * Plan an offsite so good other companies share the video of it online (Kendal)
    * Hire a Pipeline Lead and Growth Engineer (Coua)
    * Start reporting accurate recruitment diversity data monthly to the team (Coua)
    * Kick off at least 2 formal internally-focused DEI initiatives (Charles)
    * File our US and UK R&D credits and document how to do this within ops - and faster (Kendal)
    * Generate a monthly gross profit report for each product team (Grace)
    * Become sales tax compliant in NY and CA, and prepare for future states (Grace)
* **Rationale:**
    * We’ve shipped a lot of reactive/’under pressure’ type work over the past few months. With these completed or nearly completed, Q4 is an opportunity for us to sink our teeth into a few meatier projects. 
    * DEI hasn’t been prioritized during the big hiring push. We should put focused effort into upping our game here as business-as-usual won’t help us improve.

* **Objective:**
    * Build and improve our systems to support sustainable company growth.
* **Key Results:**
    * Hire a Full Stack Engineer x2 (Analytics, Session Recording) and Technical Content Marketer
    * Identify an accurate percentage of applicants who come from URG
    * Ensure we stay within 5% of forecast cash burn
    * Keep 2023 uncollected invoices under 2% of MRR, either collected or written off
    * Negotiate pre-committed AWS spend in order to cut at least 5% compared to our 2022 annual bill
    * Generate $180k in total income this quarter purely from this team's work through things like R&D tax credits and interest
    * Get our SOC 2 Type 1 report published
* **Rationale:**
    * Given recent events with SVB, a quarter of extra focus on finance feels appropriate
    * Now we have diversity data in Ashby, we want to use to improve our hiring processes

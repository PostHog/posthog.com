* **Objective:**
    * Accelerate - get new hires _and_ new customers into PostHog, faster.
* **Key Results:**
    * People: We have offers accepted by an SRE, 5x full stack engineers, and a product designer. 
    * People: Hit an average time from ‘Application received’ to ‘Offer made’ of 21 days. 
    * Ops: Ensure 100% of all ops-related monitoring tasks in Drata are completed to the minimum level required for SOC 2
    * Ops: Publish 3 collaborative marketing projects with vendor partners
    * Ops: 100% of Small Teams come under $1500/head offsite budget
* **Rationale:**
    * Recruitment is still top priority, but we should highlight speed as an important factor here. Time-to-Offer involves several subtasks we need to get right, such as super fast response times and having an excellent Ashby setup. 
    * We tidied up a lot of processes last quarter, so further improvements to team efficiency will be marginal. We should now focus on finding ways to help accelerate growth.

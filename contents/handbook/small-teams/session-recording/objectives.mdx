### Objective: Eliminate the biggest reasons product engineers would choose a competitor over PostHog Session Recording

#### KR: Release iOS Mobile Recordings to 5 happy beta testers
> **Why?** This is the most requested feature for recordings according to customer success. There is a whole market (Mobile B2C) we currently can’t address because we don’t support this functionality. We’ll start with just iOS, then use this to extend to React Native. Learnings from this should make following up with Android straightforward.

#### KR: Release the ‘Network Tab’ to 10 happy customers
> **Why?** This will allow our target users, product engineers, to debug problematic sessions more quickly and therefore get more value out of the product


### Objective: Recordings work and are available

#### KR: Rollout RRWeb2 and improve our ability to debug / improve recording issues
> **Why?** We are heavy users of RRweb but we aren't super active in the improvement / maintenance of it. If we can test, debug and improve this part of the product we can react to incoming customers with the kind of iterative response they expect

#### KR: Increase retention for paying users to > 3 months
> **Why?** One of our USPs is that you can dive deeper on your Insight by looking at recordings related to a funnel, insight etc. Currently we are limited by our storage method but we have a plan to use cheaper, long term storage so we should execute on it.

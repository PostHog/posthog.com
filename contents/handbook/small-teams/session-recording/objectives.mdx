### Objective: Eliminate the biggest reasons product engineers would choose a competitor over PostHog Session Recording

#### KR: Release iOS Mobile Recordings to 5 happy beta testers

> **Why?** This is the most requested feature for recordings according to customer success. There is a whole market (Mobile B2C) we currently can’t address because we don’t support this functionality. We’ll start with just iOS, then use this to extend to React Native. Learnings from this should make following up with Android straightforward.

#### KR: Release the ‘Network Tab’ to 10 happy customers
> **Why?** This will allow our target users, product engineers, to debug problematic sessions more quickly and therefore get more value out of the product

### Objective: Enable product engineers to quickly find meaningful insights using PostHog session recordings 

#### KR: Getting to recordings from an Insight is “slick”
> **Why?** A huge value in PostHog is being able to get from quantative anaylsis to qualatative. Currently however it is slow and painful to do. Getting this rights feeds into PostHog as your Product OS and not just as isolated product tools.

#### KR: Filtering for your recordings is intuitive and fast
> **Why?** This is a core part of our unique offering, enabling users to find recordings that demonstrate exactly what they are after. We know how this can be better so we should nail it.

## Responsibilities

Team Ingestion owns our ingestion pipeline end-to-end. That means we own:
- Django server ingestion API
- Ingestion app server
- Exports and webhooks
- Transformation apps
- Client libraries, where it pertains to event ingestion
- Kafka and ClickHouse setup, where it pertains to event ingestion
- Async migrations

Our work generally falls into one of three categories:

### Ingestion robustness

On the road to providing the best events pipeline in the world, we need to build a system that is robust. 

To do so, we must ensure:

- **Reliability:** We should not lose events and events ingested should be correct
- **Scalability:** We should be able to scale to massive event volumes
- **Maintainability:** It should be easy to debug and contribute to our ingestion pipeline

Thus, it is our responsibility to consistently revise our past decisions and improve processes where we see fit, from client library behaviors to ClickHouse schemas.

### Scaffolding to support core PostHog features

In order to achieve company goals or introduce new features (often owned by other teams), changes to our ingestion pipeline may be required.

An example of this is the work to remodel our events to store person and group data, which is essential to ensuring we can provide fast querying for users. While querying data is not owned by this team, the change to enable faster queries requires a large restructuring of our events pipeline, and thus we are owners of that component of the project.

In short, a core responsibility of our team is to enable other teams to be successful.

### Pipelines

We're building the most extensible and integrated data pipeline, which we treat as a separate product just like product analytics and feature flags, for example. The PostHog data warehouse is one destination, and the most important, but we care about getting data into all the places where it is valuable.

## How do we work?

We run a quick 15min standup on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and extend the slot if we feel the need to have a longer synchronous discussion about a specific topic. We document every standup on [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHeef4lWQ4rSBXmaM6A9_GHmARXax7If4B0duo8gFSE/edit?usp=sharing).

We are happy to sync anytime if we feel it is important to do so. This is generally coordinated on Slack where someone will spontaneously drop a Zoom link. Some of the reasons we sync include: debugging outages, sharing context (including shadowing), making decisions when there's been a deadlock, and pairing sessions.

We work as a team. Our priorities are owned by the team, and we work together towards the same overall goal every sprint. It is inevitable that sometimes tasks will fall on one person or another, but we try hard to share context and collaborate as much as possible.

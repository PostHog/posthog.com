- Objective: Events are ingested and processed reliably, accurately, and quickly on all deployments
    - Key result:
        - End-to-end P95 time to ingest events is under 1m30s for "normal events" and 2m30s for "buffer events" (note: includes 60s error bars)
        - We ingest 99.999% of valid events
            - Limit dead letter queue usage
        - Ingestion on self-hosted deployments is horizontally scalable
    - Why?
        - For customers to trust our product they need to be confident in our ability to handle their volumes reliably

## Objectives: Q2 2023

- Objective: CDP - Owner @fuziontech
    - Key Result: Rock solid webhooks - Owner @hazzadous
    - Key Result: Rock solid batch processing (exports) - Owner @tomasfarias
- Objective: Pipeline unblocks query performance and ensures data quality - Owner @tiina303
    - Key Result: Persons on Events write path and squash shipped with monitoring and alerting
    - Key Result: Backfills are complete for all teams
    - Key Result: Guaranteed deduplication of UUIDs in events table within 7 days (with docs explaining it)
    - Key Result: Query time deduplication of events to cover until ClickHouse deduplication is complete
- Objective: Pipeline Robustness and Reliability - Owner @xvello
    - Key Result: Errors cause kafka lag instead of DLQ production e.g. person creation failures cause kafka lag not go to DLQ
    - Key Result: Plugin server scales elastically and deploys do not create more than 2 minutes of lag


## Objectives: Q1 2023

- Objective: Performance
    - Key Results: We have wrapped up the person-on-event project and have deprecated the old non-person-on-events queries
        - Why? Performance speed up
    - Key Results: We have reduced the cost per event for capture by an order of magnitude
        - Why? Infra savings and improves performance
- Objective: Reliability
    - Key Results: We have converted all current US dashboards into IaC dashboards configured in Terraform and made all necessary migrations from StatsD to Prom to support this.
        - Why? Gets US and EU equivalent in terms of monitoring
    - Key Results: All of our alerts have runbooks
        - Why? Improve incident recovery times and share knowledge with all engineers, so that most incidents can be resolved without escalating to the team
    - Key Results: Backfills do not slow us down or take down the system. We have tests for this.
        - Why? Improves service quality and protects against bad actors
    - Key Results: Erroring apps fail gracefully, do not take down anything else, and we have tests to prove this. And re-enable after temporary unavailability
        - Why? Improves service quality and tackles customer annoyance of apps turning off when there's an error

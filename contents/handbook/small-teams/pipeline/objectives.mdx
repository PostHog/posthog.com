## Objectives: Q1 2023

- Objective: Performance
    - Key Results: We have wrapped up the person-on-event project and have deprecated the old non-person-on-events queries
    - Key Results: We have reduced the cost per event for capture by an order of magnitude
- Objective: Reliability
    - Key Results: Raise the bar of monitoring, alerting, runbooks + make equivalent EU and US .
    - Key Results: Backfills do not slow us down or take down the system. We have tests for this.
    - Key Results: Erroring apps fail gracefully, do not take down anything else, and we have tests to prove this.

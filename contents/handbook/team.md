## James Hawkins, Co-Founder and CEO

James spent the first 10 years of his career trying to be a professional cyclist. He used to do web development part time to make some money on the side.

One day, after another big crash, he got offered a full time job - he ended up bootstrapping an online marketing company, spending $MMs on paid ads and building a lot of software to optimize ad spends, to run a call center, and how to distribute data and manage ad spends dynamically.

After that, he moved to Arachnys, where he ended up becoming the VP Sales. He ran a team selling very large deals to big financial institutions.

## Tim Glaser, Co-Founder and CTO

## Aaron Tanner, VP Community

Aaron met James and Tim at Arachnys where he joined as Arachnys' earliest salesperson. He worked with them for 4 years before he left to join a record label that got 2 UK chart No.1s

This circuitous route meant he has acted as an online marketer, product manager and as a salesperson/leader all of which go into growing and supporting PostHog's community.

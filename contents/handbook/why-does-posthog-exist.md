## Our mission

To help engineers build better products.

## Our strategy

### Provide every tool needed for evaluating feature success

We want engineers to engineer their products, not their data, and to not have to hire lots of product managers to pull together context from lots of tools.

By integrating all these tools we can make this easy – no integration needed, no extra vendors, no extra JavaScript, no sending data to extra 3rd parties, and workflows to guide engineers through feature development.

### Get in first

We shouldn't aim to integrate with a stack of existing tools that we don't believe in.

Instead, we should get in first – and take people into what we consider best practices. Largely, just having everything in one place. By focusing on engineers, we can be their preferred choice and get in before any other tools are set up, not that we'll say no if someone wants to migrate to us later on.

By already being used by our customers, we’re the default for each additional tool they add. By laddering our tools – for example, session recording is used much earlier in the lifecycle of the product than others like the CDPs – we can avoid competition.

### Be the source of truth for customer and product data

Traditionally as companies scale, their data warehouse becomes the source of truth, and non-warehouse native tools (like product analytics) become less relevant as people lose trust in the data in them. However, by providing the data and data-intense tools in one place, we can enhance the power of our products (like product analytics), provide increased trust, _and_ enable companies to build on top of the warehouse itself as they see fit, all _without_ them having to set up a complex stack.

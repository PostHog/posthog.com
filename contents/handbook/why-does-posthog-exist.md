## Our mission

Equip every developer to build successful products

## Our strategy

### 1. Provide every tool needed to build successful products

Building a successful product is hard; doing so when you don't understand your customers is even harder.

We aim to offer every tool software teams need to find, sell to, get users, understand who they are, support them and improve their product experience.

### 2. Get in first

The tools we build help you from your first user to when your product is everything it could be.

This means PostHog gives you the best practices, and the industry standard tools, so you can focus on what you do best: building successful products. 

We offer a generous free tier, no-brainer pricing, and data infrastructure that scales until IPO and beyond.

### 3. Be the source of truth for customer and product data

Traditionally, as companies scale, their data warehouse becomes the source of truth, and non-warehouse native tools (like product analytics) become less relevant as people lose trust in the data in them.

By providing the data and data-intense tools in one place, we can:
- Enhance the utility of our products when used together
- Increase trust in data by eliminating complex data stacks
- Provide all the tools companies need as they grow

Building a successful product is hard. It gets harder when you don't understand how your customers are using your product.

PostHog includes all the tools you need to understand how people use your product. All with one simple snippet.

### Start from the start

The tools we build help you from your first user to when your product is everything it could be.

This means PostHog gives you the best practices and the industry standard tools so that you can focus on what you do best - build successful products. There's a generous free tier, no-brainer pricing and data infrastructure that scales until IPO and beyond.

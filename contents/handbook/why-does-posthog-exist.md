## Our mission

Equip every developer to build successful products

## Our strategy

### Provide every tool needed to build successful products

Building a successful product is hard. It gets harder when you don't understand how your customers are using your product.

PostHog includes all the tools you need to understand how people use your product. All with one simple snippet.

### Start from the start

The tools we build help you from your first user to when your product is everything it could be.

This means PostHog gives you the best practices and the industry standard tools so that you can focus on what you do best - build successful products. There's a generous free tier, no-brainer pricing and data infrastructure that scales until IPO and beyond.

### Be the source of truth for customer and product data

Traditionally, as companies scale, their data warehouse becomes the source of truth, and non-warehouse native tools (like product analytics) become less relevant as people lose trust in the data in them. By providing the data and data-intense tools in one place, we can enhance the power of our products (like product analytics), provide increased trust, and enable companies to build on top of the warehouse itself as they see fit, all without them having to set up a complex stack.

## Our mission

Equip every developer to build successful products.

## A few words

On the surface, PostHog's products are a bunch of different developer tools, which work together better than anyone else's. However, the secret to our success is our long term plan: become the essential toolkit for product engineers by building around the unit they operate on - all the context they need to ship products.

Critical to making this happen is to deliver each tool without compromise - better, cheaper and with all the context engineers need in one place. The way to achieve this is very simple - shipping every product that engineering teams use, from day one when there are just two technical cofounders. This is because if we get in with these developers, we're upstream of every need they'll have. The end result is that we can offer all the products in one place, with no need to charge as much as everyone else for each one, and most importantly with perfect quality context - customer data, session replays, errors, logs, metrics, usage data and everything else they need to ship products.


I’d like to address a repeated argument against shipping multiple products, let alone all of them.

### You can build more than a product or two

The world of tech is changing fast.

First, there’s just more money at better valuations than when this advice was created. Software companies, us included, have more leverage than ever before - with capital deployed well, we can do more than our predecessors.

Second, software development is far quicker.

Third, we’ve managed this very well so far. 

## Our strategy

### 1. Be the source of truth for all product context

Building a successful product is hard; doing so when you don't understand your customers is even harder. It's wild that no one has already provided a complete record of everything engineers need to ship products. This has happened because the entire industry has focused on integration instead of consolidation.

Traditionally, as companies scale, their data warehouse becomes the source of truth, and non-warehouse native tools (like product analytics) become less relevant as engineers lose trust in the data they collect, simply because they are misused and divorced from the source of truth. Every company winds up with a huge mess of data spaghetti, with their business logic still spread across dozens or hundreds of tools.

We provide developer infrastructure - by providing _every_ tool engineers need in one place, we can:

- Enhance the utility of all the tools when used together by engineering teams
- Increase trust in data by eliminating complex data stacks that engineers have to navigate
- Automate everything better than anyone else can, by using AI across this wider context
- Continue to provide all the tools engineering teams need as they grow

### 2. Provide every tool needed to build successful products

We aim to offer every tool engineering teams need to debug, understand, and improve their products. From session replay for debugging to feature flags for safe deployments, we help engineers ship better code faster.

We can then get our AI to work across all of them together, whilst making every individual tool cheaper than the rest of the market - since we provide so many we can charge less. This means engineers get better tools at a fraction of the cost of piecing together solutions from multiple vendors.

### 3. Get in first

Since developers exist first in a startup, by getting in with them early, we are naturally upstream of every other tool they might have considered using. Although anyone can pick up our products (and lots of mature companies certainly do), this means we can best deliver developer infrastructure to early stage companies, and so should focus there by default.

_Once_ we land a customer, we then let them pull _us_ upmarket as they grow. But not before. We don't want to hire a big enterprise sales team and go upmarket before our existing customers are there. This keeps us efficient and able to stay focused on building tools that engineers actually want to use.

## Secret master plan

* Ship every tool that engineering teams need to ship products. We call this developer infrastructure. It's the tools and all the context they need together.
* Automate all of these tools - this is Max AI.
* (not here yet) Expand the range of products to meet the needs of teams that aren't software-focused.

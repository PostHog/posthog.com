We're frequently contacted about revenue-sharing partnerships, or individuals and agencies that want to be listed as official partners. We do not currently operate any form of partnership program to help users implement, extend, or adapt PostHog to their needs.

**If someone contacts you about partnering with PostHog**, refer them to [Joe](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/29070). He'll give them the bad news and explore any opportunities.  

Instead, we recommend users who need this sort of help explore our existing resources, or [contact us](http://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal). If we can help, we will!

## Helpful resources for users
Users who contact us about wanting support from a partner often want particular types of help. We've curated some resources below which we can give them so they can self-serve where possible. 

### Migration help
If a customer contacts us about migrating data into PostHog we should first refer them to the Sales & CS Team, who will triage them. We also have guides to help teams migrate data on their own.

- [Migrating from Amplitude to PostHog](/docs/migrate/migrate-from-amplitude)
- [Migrating from Mixpanel to PostHog](/docs/migrate/mixpanel)
- [Migrating from Heap to PostHog](/docs/migrate/heap)
- [Migrating from LaunchDarkly to PostHog](/docs/migrate/launchdarkly)
- [Migrating from Statsig to PostHog](/docs/migrate/statsig)
- [Migrating from a self-hosted deployment to PostHog Cloud](/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud#between-cloud-instances-eg-us-cloud-to-eu-cloud)
- [Syncing other platforms to our data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse/setup)

### Implementation help
Sometimes teams want help or advice on their event taxonomy, or creating specific insights. Users who look like they have the potential to pay >$20k should generally be referred to the Sales & CS team, otherwise they should go through the regular support flow. We also have [a wide variety of dashboard templates](/templates) and tutorials to help teams get started.

If the user is very new then we usually strongly advise [enabling auto-capture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) and [creating an AARRR dashboard](/product-engineers/aarrr-pirate-funnel) as a first step. 

### Self-hosted help
[We no longer provide support for self-hosted deployments](/blog/sunsetting-helm-support-posthog). If users contact us for help with self-hosted deployments then we refer them to [our legacy docs](/docs/self-host) and strongly recommend they [migrate to PostHog Cloud]((/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud#between-cloud-instances-eg-us-cloud-to-eu-cloud)).

### Getting more help (from someone else)
If users need more help than we can reasonably provide, they may ask for external support or partners. **We do not have any official partners** and users should know that any suggestions we may make are not vetted or accreddited in any way. 

That said, some users have found success working with the following external partners:

- [Taleno.Digital](https://taleno.digital/) (US)
- [Mentat Analytics](https://www.mentatanalytics.co/) (US)
- [Marketing Engineers](https://marketingengineers.nl/) (NL)

Sometimes teams are able to find success by posting on platforms such as [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/).

The customer comms team exists to give users the info they need to be successful with PostHog, and to deliver that information in a way which sparks joy. 

That means we cover a wide mix of things, including customer support, announcements, press, and other product marketing tasks. 

We also lead the PostHog for Startups and Y Combinator programs, and generally take point on anything requiring customer-facing communication. 

As a team we value being hands-on, putting human needs above internal processes, and treating support as a product.

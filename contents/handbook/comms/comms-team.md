The customer comms team exists to give users the info they need to be successful with PostHog, and to deliver that information in a way which sparks joy. 

That means we cover a wide mix of things, including customer support, announcements, press, and other product marketing tasks. 

We also lead the PostHog for Startups and Y Combinator programs, and generally take point on anything requiring customer-facing communication. 

The comms team is still a new team, so we've yet to decide if we need particular principles for the way we work. Generally we should value clarity, speed, and good humour in communication and err towards being generous with users when possible.

* Don’t innovate on the MVP even if not integrated properly with everything else.
  * We stressed about this loads with the warehouse but quickly realized that people are happy to use our products pretty separately in the early days - we don't need to be better than the rest of the market on day 1 of launching.
* Don’t even think about pricing until you have users. If people are using it, money will come.
  * Pricing is distracting and complicated and it's not necessary to ship a product and start getting feedback. You should move existing free users onto a paid plan if you create a paid plan later, but give them more usage as a thank you, and be upfront during the free period about this.
* We need separate teams to build new products. Don't create them within an existing team.
  * Shipping from within an existing team causes things to take much longer because you'll get pulled onto bugs, merging PRs etc.
* Don't put new people on new products. Definitely don't have new people _lead_ new products.
  * Learning how PostHog works isn't going to happen on a fresh product quite so well. Take people from existing teams to run the new product so they can do that having learned the PostHog way.
* Force usage from internal users as soon as possible, replace our 3rd party SaaS tools slightly early.
  * We are a really good user for most of our products, so why wouldn't we.
* One person teams are fine to get started, but we should add a second person very quickly.
  * This avoids the need for hiring to block getting started, and longer term prevents loneliness and helps with shipping speed.
* Build "must have" features ahead of more SDK coverage.
  * Sometimes we could add more SDKs "to get more growth", but we should start by making sure we can offer the bare minimum within the first SDKs we support. Don't default to loads of SDKs if you know you have huge feature gaps as that will disappoint lots of users.

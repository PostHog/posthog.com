It's sometimes worth releasing big new features under a 'beta' label to set expectations with customers that this feature is still in active development, and might have some rough edges.

## What a beta feature should do

A beta feature still needs to provide value to a customer. Mocking out the frontend without any functionality does not count as a beta feature.

## What a beta feature doesn't have to do

A beta feature doesn't need to have a perfect interface, does not need to be performant for high volume customers and can have big open bugs (as long as it still provides value).

## Time limit

Aim to not have a beta label on a feature for more than two releases.

## UX elements to show a feature is in beta

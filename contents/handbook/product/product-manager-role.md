## Why do we have Product Managers?

Product development at PostHog is engineering led, all new projects and existing [features have an engineering owner](/handbook/engineering/feature-ownership) who is the "informed captain" making the final call on everything that they build. Product Managers ensure these owners have the company, industry and customer context they need to make great decisions whilst challenging them to move faster and think bigger.

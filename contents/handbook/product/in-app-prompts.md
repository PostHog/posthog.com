If you want to announce a new feature, invite a customer to a slack channel or drive engagement of a particular feature in the product you might want to use our in-app prompts.

## How to create a new prompt

In-app prompts are powered by JSON feature flags.

1. Create a new feature flag with the name starting with `prompt-`
2. Add the payload

   ```
   {
      title: string // title of the prompt
      body: string // body of the prompt, can be HTML including links
      type: PromptType // type of the prompt - either 'modal' or 'popup'
      image?: string // url of the image
      url_match?: string // regex to match url against e.g. '.*feature_flags.*'
      primaryButtonText?: string // text for the primary button
      secondaryButtonText?: string // text for the secondary button
      primaryButtonURL?: string // url for the primary button (opens in a new window)
   }
   ```

3. Add the cohort or user properties that you want to show the prompt to.
   - If you want to show a prompt based on events, you should create a dynamic cohort based on the event, then export the cohort and use it to create a static feature flag.
4. **Important** Add the release condition that the user property `${feature_flag_name}` **is not set**. This ensures that the prompt is only shown once.

It will only show one prompt a day, no matter how many prompt feature flags are enabled.

It's recommended to run the prompt for yourself first to make sure it works as expected. If you need to test it again the easiest way is to change the feature flag name (make sure to keep the user property `${feature_flag_name}` up to date).

Shows in the middle of the screen. It's more intrusive than a popup.

PostHog has a [product-minded engineering organization](/blog/turning-engineers-into-product-people). Engineers own sprint planning and speccing out solutions. Read more on the role of the Product Team in this [blog post](/blog/product-at-posthog).

At the same time, engineering small teams are multidisciplinary and have different focuses within the Product. To support Engineering well, Product and Design are cross-functional too and can work within multiple small teams. Instead of Product Managers (PMs) and Product Designers working on everything a small team works on, they have specific goals that transcend team lines.

PMs or Product Designers fully belong to the relevant small teams (up to 2) so both teams have a strong sense that the person is there to support them both equally in respect to the goals, and to make it clear there are no inter-team dependencies.

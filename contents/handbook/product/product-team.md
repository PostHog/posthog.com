PostHog has a [product-minded engineering organization](/blog/turning-engineers-into-product-people). Engineers own sprint planning and spec'ing out solutions. Read more on the role of the Product Team in this [blog post](/blog/product-at-posthog).

So, what is the role of product managers at PostHog? PMs set context across multiple products for how products are being used, what the competitive landscape is like, what users are feeling about PostHog, and how they're using things.

Among other things, they

1. run [growth reviews](/handbook/product/per-product-growth-reviews) for products that have product-market-fit
2. organize [user interviews](/handbook/product/user-feedback)
3. coach product engineers on ["how to do product"](/handbook/engineering/product-engineering)

## Small team membership

Each PM belongs to a small number of our small engineering teams, so that all teams have a strong sense that the PM is there to support them equally. This also ensures that the PM has the time to dive deep into issues that require it.

Here is a overview that shows which of our PMs currently works with which team:

**Anna**
- [Data Warehouse](/teams/data-warehouse)
- [Product Analytics](/teams/product-analytics)
- [Web Analytics](web-analytics)

**Annika**
- [Session Replay](/teams/session-replay)
- [Feature Flags](/teams/feature-flags)
- [Experiments](/teams/experiments)
  
**Teams with no PM currently**
- [CDP](/teams/cdp)
- [CRM](/teams/crm)
- [Error Tracking](/teams/error-tracking)
- [LLM Observability](/teams/llm-observability)
- [Max AI](/teams/max-ai)
- [Messaging](/teams/messaging)
- [Revenue Analytics](/teams/revenue-analytics)
- [Surveys](/teams/surveys)

## Product goals

Product managers primarily support their teams in reaching their goals. The top two priorities of each PM are to run a growth review at the beginning of every month for each of their products, and to organise regular user interviews. (Our rule of thumb is 1 interview per week per PM).

The [quarterly per-product planning](/handbook/company/goal-setting) typically highlight the biggest blind spots a team or product has (e.g. what metrics or parts of the product do we think have potential, but we don't have enough context yet). Teams are encouraged to include their "biggest unknown" as a research goal for the PM to own as part of their quarterly goals. Findings should be shared asynchronously via a GitHub PR in [#product-internal](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal), and in the growth reviews or team standups where applicable.

As the PM team, we are also pursuing a couple of side projects each quarter with the goal of leveling up how we do Product at PostHog.

In Q2 2025, those are:

**Goal 1: V2 growth review and product usage metrics**
* Define per-product revenue metrics & benchmarks, based on Mine's "all revenue" work -> Anna
* Define a set of usage metrics we can track across products, consider a dashboard template for this -> Annika
* Bring it together for V2 growth reviews -> both

**Goal 2: Increase adoption of Buildbetter** -> Anna
* How can different roles get the most value out of the tool? (PM, Engineering, Sales, ...)

**Goal 3: Hire a new PM** -> Annika & Raquel
* Product ownership: CDP, then Error tracking and surveys

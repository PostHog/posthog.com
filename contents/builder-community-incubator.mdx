    <p>
      Bring together a group of at least 10 people to co-work and build for 5 straight weeks. The goal is to give you the initial push but let you carry forward afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a consistent time and structure that works for your group. For times, do evenings or weekends. For format, we suggest two ingredients: building and demo-ing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us know how it's going along the way.

<details>
<summary>Who is eligible to lead?</summary>
<p>You are someone who really wants to get together with other builders. You are plugged into your local ecosystem and operate with a bias for action.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is eligible to attend?</summary>
<p>Individuals or small teams who want to build products.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if more than one person applies from the same city?</summary>
<p>For the pilot program we'll only select one based on your application and past experience. We'll connect you with other applicants from the same city.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens after 6 weeks?</summary>
<p>You've now bootstrapped a community, keep it going. If you didn't get the traction required to keep it going, we'll mourn then move on.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What level of support do I get?</summary>
<p>We're looking for organizers who can drive this builder community with limited support from us. Still, we'll be here to help along the way.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's in it for us?</summary>
<p>We are excited about helping to bootstrap communities of builders around the world. That's what we're in it for. No one needs to use PostHog as part of this.</p>

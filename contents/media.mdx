## About PostHog

PostHog enables developers to build successful products. 

We do this by providing the tools teams need to capture events, perform analytics, record user sessions, conduct experiments, deploy new features, and more, all in one platform. And we're constantly shipping new things!

Founded in January 2020 by James Hawkins and Tim Glaser, PostHog was a member of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and has subsequently raised $27m in funding from [GV](https://www.gv.com/), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), and notable angel investors including Jason Warner (CTO, GitHub), Solomon Hykes (Founder, Docker), and David Cramer (Founder, Sentry).

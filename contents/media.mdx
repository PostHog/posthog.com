## About PostHog

PostHog is the open-source, all-in-one platform that helps engineers build better products. 

We enable software teams to capture events, perform analytics, record user sessions, conduct experiments and deploy new features, all in one platform. 

Founded in January 2020 by James Hawkins and Tim Glaser, PostHog was a member of Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 batch, and has subsequently raised $27m in funding from [GV](https://www.gv.com/), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), and notable angel investors including Jason Warner (CTO, GitHub), Solomon Hykes (Founder, Docker), and David Cramer (Founder, Sentry).

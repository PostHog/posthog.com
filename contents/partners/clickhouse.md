ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system. (Note: PostHog runs on ClickHouse!)

Host PostHog on your own infrastructure, but leave the ClickHouse database management to the same team who built ClickHouse! ClickHouse is actively developing a hosted version of their database that splits compute from storage so that you only pay for the resources that you use, when you use them.

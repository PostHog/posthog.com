# Q1 2026

## Objective 1: Export anything anywhere

### Motivation
* Users frequently request new destinations covered by CDP.
* Users frequently request exporting of transformed and/or joined data, which can be achieved via a data warehouse materialized view.

### What we’ll ship
* Enable multiple (or all) CDP destinations for batch exports.
  * In the process, deprecate HTTP batch export in favor of using a CDP destination.
* Assist with design and implementation of a unified data-pipelines UI.
* Support a batch export for backfilling of PostHog Workflows using batch exports.
* Maybe: Enable batch exporting of data warehouse views.

## Objective 2: Keep batch exports running into the future

### Motivation
* The team is feeling pressure from maintenance load, which is impacting goals and feature work.
* The team sometimes takes too long to diagnose an issue due to lack of metrics and debugging tools.
* Users, particularly larger-volume users, are demanding better performance when exporting and backfilling.
* Users sometimes reach out to support because they lack tools to debug issues themselves.

### What we’ll ship
* Unified tooling for debugging a broken batch export.
  * Including: Logs, metrics, configuration parameters, run history, and more!
* Improve metrics and tracing to more quickly and accurately detect issues with batch exports.
* Expose better logs and metrics for users to resolve issues themselves.
* Review and adjust error recovery procedures (like automated retries).
* Ensure performance can scale to larger users.
* Ensure support for the most popular features of all destinations.

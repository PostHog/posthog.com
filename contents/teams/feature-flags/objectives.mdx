### Q4 2025 Objectives

#### Objective 1: Awesome documentation <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
Motivation: Present feature flags as a mature and sophisticated product through excellent documentation, following the experiments team's successful approach.

What we will ship:
* Partner with the [content team](/teams/content) for comprehensive refresh
* Clear structure covering all SDK types and evaluation methods  
* Real-world scenario walkthroughs
* AI-related content – examples of how to use flags with AI features
* Easy navigation from app to relevant docs

#### Objective 2: Make local evaluation the default <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
Motivation: Enable faster, more reliable flag evaluations by making local evaluation the default for server-side SDKs, while also improving the durability of the `/local_evaluation` endpoint itself.

What we will ship:
* **HyperCache + local eval completion** – Finish implementation of `/local_evaluation` powered by HyperCache <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Properties solution** – Solve the blocker preventing wider local eval adoption: make it easier for users to provide properties needed for flag evaluation <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Better documentation & guides** – Create how-to guides for local evaluation setup <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Endpoint resilience** – Make the `/local_evaluation` endpoint completely resilient to database outages <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **ETag support** – Implement efficient caching for reduced bandwidth <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

#### Objective 3: UI/UX improvements [Team](/teams/feature-flags)
Motivation: Fix known UI issues and identify future improvements through systematic user research.

What we will ship:
* **Known issue fixes** – Address existing backlog of cohort UI bugs & UX issues <TeamMember name="Gustavo Strassburger" />
* **10+ user interviews** – Conduct user interviews across the team focusing on flags UI and cohort usage [Team](/teams/feature-flags)
* **Cohort improvements roadmap** – Define what we need to build to supercharge cohorts [Team](/teams/feature-flags)
* **Flags UI improvements roadmap** – Define concrete next steps for UI improvements based on research [Team](/teams/feature-flags)

#### Objective 4: SDK standardization <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" photo />
Motivation: Create a consistent experience across all SDKs, making it easier for teams to adopt PostHog across their entire stack.

What we will ship:
* **Java SDK** – Ship initial version and mature based on customer feedback
* **SDK consistency** – Burn down [SDK standardization meta-issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/31425)

#### Objective 5: Flag staleness cleanup system <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
Motivation: Help teams manage technical debt from stale flags with automated detection and cleanup tools.

What we will ship:
* **Stale flag detection** – Identify and surface stale flags in the PostHog UI
* **In-app cleanup tools** – Provide easy tools to clean up stale flags directly in PostHog
* **Code cleanup prompts** – Generate prompts for Cursor/Claude Code to clean up flag debt in codebases
* **Automated actions** (stretch) – Additional automated cleanup options (create PR)

#### Objective 6: Natural language flag creation <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
Motivation: Enable users to create feature flags using natural language with AI assistance.

What we will ship:
* **"Build a flag with Max"** – Natural language interface for creating feature flags with AI

#### Objective 7: Platform infrastructure improvements <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
Motivation: Reduce technical debt and improve system performance for better reliability and faster development.

What we will ship:
* **Persons Database split completion** – Finish the persons database split from the feature flags perspective (a shared goal with the Ingestion team)
* **Deprecate /decide** – Remove the `/decide` endpoint from the latest version of the hosted PostHog app while maintaining self-hosted compatibility in the SDKs.
* **Rewrite /evaluation_reasons** – Modernize `/evaluation_reasons` endpoint
* **Behavioral cohort completion** – Finish remaining behavioral cohort targeting work

#### Objective 8: Enhanced debugging capabilities <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
Motivation: Improve visibility into flag evaluations for better debugging and troubleshooting.

What we will ship:
* **Enhanced $feature_flag_called** – Include properties used for evaluation in the event
* **Historical evaluation view** – Show flag evaluation results for a person over time

#### Objective 9: Real-time feature flags <TeamMember name="Gustavo Strassburger" photo />
Motivation: Enable real-time use cases for feature flags, allowing instant updates without page refreshes or app restarts.

What we will ship:
* **Real-time flag updates** – Implement WebSocket/SSE-based real-time flag changes
* **SDK support** – Add real-time capabilities to key SDKs

#### Objective 10: Remote config as secret store exploration <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" photo />
Motivation: Explore the viability of extending remote config feature flags to serve as a secure configuration and secrets management system.

What we will ship:
* **Feasibility research** – Investigate technical requirements and security implications

#### Future exploration (Q1 2025 candidates)
* **Centralized evaluation logic** – Explore unified targeting via wasm/dll ([details](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/799))
* **Platform integrations** – Integrate feature flags with PostHog workflows, error tracking, events, logs
* **AI use cases** – Identify more AI-powered features for flags

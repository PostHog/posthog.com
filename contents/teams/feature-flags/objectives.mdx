## Q2 2025 Objectives

### Flag Stability & Consistency, and Resiliency
*Goal: Create a highly stable, consistent, and resilient feature flag system capable of supporting 10x growth*

1. Scale `/flags` service
   - Complete 100% worldwide rollout of `/flags` endpoint to all customers
   - Measure and validate improved query performance metrics
   - Document infrastructure cost savings achieved

2. Standardize SDK Error Handling and UX
   - Implement unified error handling framework across all SDKs
   - Develop comprehensive error classification system with standardized messages
   - Create consistent fallback and default behaviors across platforms
   - Ensure all SDKs utilize the latest flags response format (v2)

3. Enhance System Resilience
   - Decouple flag service from writer DB
   - Deploy flags on differentiated infrastructure aligned with varying scale needs
   - Implement circuit breakers for graceful degradation during upstream failures
   - Establish reliability SLAs and monitoring for flag delivery

### Behavioral Cohort Targeting
*Goal: Enable customers to target feature flags based on user behaviors*

1. Ship Beta Release
   - Develop core behavioral targeting functionality
   - Create intuitive UI for defining behavioral cohorts
   - Implement backend services to process and apply cohort rules

2. Customer Adoption
   - Identify and onboard 5-10 key customers for beta testing
   - Establish success metrics and collect usage data
   - Document use cases and implementation patterns
   - Create support resources for customer implementation

## AI IDE Integration
*Goal: Streamline developer workflow with AI-powered flag implementation*

1. Create Intelligent Code Snippets
   - Develop context-aware code generation system for feature flags
   - Ensure generated code follows best practices for each language/framework

2. IDE Integration
   - Build plugins/extensions for AI IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, potentially our own)
   - Create seamless workflow from flag creation to code implementation
   - Implement AI-assisted troubleshooting for flag implementation issues

3. Developer Experience
   - Measure time-to-implementation improvements
   - Collect developer feedback on integration experience
   - Iterate based on usage patterns and pain points

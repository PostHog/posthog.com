## Q3 2025 Objectives

### Objective 1: Behavioral Cohort Targeting

Motivation: Enable dynamic behavioral targeting across PostHog – let customers target users based on what they've done (or haven't done) recently. In other words, enable customers to target feature flags on [behavioral cohorts](/docs/data/cohorts).

This is an objective shared across multiple teams ([Messaging](/teams/messaging), [Feature Flags](/teams/feature-flags), [Ingestion](/teams/ingestion), and [Surveys](/teams/surveys)) who all need behavioral targeting to enhance their products. We'll build a platform that integrates with our ingestion pipeline to pre-process event data for targeting, then integrate this service into existing product targeting functionality.

We'll deliver this in 3 stages with Stage 1 well-defined and Stages 2-3 evolving based on how Stage 1 goes. Note that stages can overlap – we may begin customer partnerships and product integrations as soon as the POC works well enough, potentially before Stage 2 is completed.

**Stage 1: Proof-of-concept**

Build a proof of concept behavioral cohort data ingestion service as the foundation. Owned by <TeamMember name ="Ben White" photo /> (CDP/Messaging) and <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> (Feature Flags).

What we will ship:
* **Support behavioral cohort filter as Hog bytecode** – Make cohort filters representable as Hog code for our CDP pipeline <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
* **Build system for loading/matching/saving targeting results** – Create a system that writes matches to a low-latency datastore (not Clickhouse) that other applications can query <TeamMember name="Ben White" photo />
* **Validate with ingestion team** – Ensure the POC doesn't negatively impact ingestion latency or scale (TBD owner from [Ingestion](/teams/ingestion))

**Stage 2: Make it scale**

Implement the scaling solution based on POC learnings and ingestion team collaboration. Specific work TBD based on Stage 1 results.

**Stage 3: Integrate across PostHog**

Add behavioral cohort targeting to existing products using our new low-latency datastore.

What we will ship:
* **Behavioral Cohort Targeting for Feature Flags** – Add behavioral cohorts to existing feature flag targeting <TeamMember name ="Dylan Martin" photo />
* **Behavioral Cohort Targeting for Surveys** – Add behavioral cohorts to existing survey targeting (owner TBD)
* **Behavioral Cohort Targeting for Messaging** – Enable behavioral targeting in messaging (owner TBD)

**Customer Validation:** Partner with 5-10 key customers to validate use cases, gather feedback, and measure impact on conversion and engagement. This can begin as soon as we have a working POC, potentially in parallel with Stage 2 work. <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Annika Schmid" photo />

### Objective 2: Flag Management & Advanced Features  
Motivation: Solve flag management pain points for large customers and add advanced flag targeting capabilities.

What we will ship:
* **Flag categorization system** – Let customers organize flags into categories and only request the ones they need such, e.g. client flags, server flags, both. <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Automatic stale flag pruning** – Build tools to identify and help customers clean up unused/stale flags automatically <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Flag rollouts based on other flags** – Enable targeting on flags where flag's evaluation result can determine another's rollout <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

### Objective 3: Platform Reliability & Scale
Motivation: Create a highly stable, resilient feature flag system capable of supporting our largest (and soon-to-be largest) customers with enterprise-grade reliability.

What we will ship:
* **Complete /flags rollout** – Roll everyone onto /flags endpoint and deprecate /decide, measure performance improvements <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo />
* **Enhanced observability** – Add tracking for big customer experience, implement alerting and internal SLOs/external SLAs <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo />
* **System resilience** – Decouple flag service from writer database, implement circuit breakers, build remote caches into server-side SDKs <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
* **SDK standardization** – Implement unified error handling framework and ensure all SDKs use latest (v2) flags response format <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

**Service Level SLOs:**
* **Latency:** p99 latency < 50ms. We already meet this today, but still have some spikes from experience continuity flags
* **Availability:** alarm and investigate on > 10 `5xx` errors in a 1-min period. At 85k req/min, that is a 99.988% availability

### Q1 2026 Objectives

This quarter we're focused on finishing what we started, shipping high-impact new features, and deeply understanding our users. We're baking the half-baked, building the things our users want (and that our competition doesn't), building AI-powered cleanup tools, and doing the user research to figure out what's next.

#### Bake the half-baked (Driver: <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" /> and <TeamMember name="Gustavo Henrique Strassburger" />)

We've shipped a lot of features that are 80% done. Time to finish them by clearing the [issue backlogs](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ateam%2Ffeature-flags%20-project%3APostHog%2F112) for each.

- **Cohorts** <TeamMember name="Gustavo Henrique Strassburger" photo /> — Clear the `feature/cohorts` backlog
- **Early access** <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" photo /> — Clear the `feature/early-access` backlog

#### Remote config rebrand (Driver: TBD)

Remote config works, but the value prop isn't clear. Rebrand and clarify positioning so users understand when to use it.

*TODO: Define scope and assign a driver*

#### Sand the flags UX (Driver: <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" />)

Polish the overall flags experience — scheduled flags, rollouts, and general UX improvements.

- A/B test any big UI changes rather than assuming they're better

#### Ship new targeting capabilities (Driver: <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" />)

New targeting options that unlock real value for users.

- **SemVer targeting** — Support matching semantic versions (`<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`) for app version in release conditions. Removes the need for painful regex workarounds. [#24485](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/24485)
- **User & Group targeting** — Allow targeting flags to users AND groups, not just one or the other. [#33206](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/33206)

#### Ship behavioral cohorts (Driver: <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" />)

Target flags based on user behavior (e.g. "users who completed X event").

- [Megaissue #14796](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/14796)

#### Importing flags from competitors (Driver: <TeamMember name="Gustavo Henrique Strassburger" />)

Get the Statsig and LaunchDarkly import flow over the line.

#### Ship AI-powered flag cleanup (Driver: TBD)

Automate stale flag cleanup. We've defined what "stale" means — now build the tooling.

- Start with a copied prompt, finish with native Max integration
- *TODO: Define scope for MCP integration (bidirectional?)*
- *TODO: Assign a driver*

#### Understand users better (Driver: <TeamMember name="Annika Schmid" />)

A quarter is too short to interview users, make changes, and measure metrics. The features we're already planning should move the metrics we care about — interviews help us figure out what to prioritize next.

- Conduct 10-15 user interviews
- Understand: Why do people use flags? What holds them back? Why do they drop off?
- Every engineer to attend at least 2 interviews
- Use findings to inform Q2 priorities

#### External cache (Driver: <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" />)

*TODO: Define what this is and what "done" looks like. Kick to high-priority customers for feedback.*

#### Better debuggability (Driver: <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" />)

Make it way easier to understand what's happening with your flags. [#38669](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/38669)

- Show users why flag evaluation failed when it fails
- Show users why flag evaluations returned what they did when they succeed
- Stretch: Streamline how we send flag events to ClickHouse
- Stretch: Improve how the UI renders feature flag data

### Q4 2024 Objectives

As always, reliability is the #1 goal: Making sure feature flags are reliable and performant trumps every other objective.

### Objective 1: Make sure the new feature flags service (the `/flags` endpoint) can handle 10x current scale with a 2x speed increase

In the beginning of 2024, we hit some scaling limits on flags: It's now very expensive to run flags on Django and we'll hit some scaling limits at 5x our scale.

To get ahead of this problem, [we decided]((https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/22131)) to [rewrite our flags service](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/22131) to be more performant and reliable.

As of Q3 2024, we were at 90% feature parity with the `/decide` endpoint.  Q4 will be when we roll out the new feature flag service to all users.

### Objective 2: Maintain and improve reliability of the existing feature flag platform (the `/decide` endpoint)

While we roll out the new feature flag platform, we need to maintain and improve reliability of the existing feature flag platform, which mostly consists of:

- Fixing bugs in the existing feature flag platform
- Improving alerting and monitoring of the existing feature flag platform
- Improving the documentation of the existing feature flag platform

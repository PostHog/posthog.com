### Q3 2025 Objectives

#### Objective 1: Behavioral Cohorts

Motivation: Move beyond static person properties to enable dynamic behavioral targeting – let customers target users based on what they've done (or haven't done) recently.

What we will ship:
* **Behavioral targeting engine** – Ship the ability to target users based on recent actions, like "users who haven't seen the pricing page in 7 days" or "users who completed onboarding but haven't upgraded" <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
* **Customer validation** – Partner with 5-10 key customers to validate use cases, gather feedback, and measure impact on their conversion and engagement <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Annika Schmid" photo />
* **Cross-product foundation** – Build this to also power Messaging/CDP use cases, creating a unified behavioral targeting system across PostHog <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />

#### Objective 2: Flag Management & Advanced Features  
Motivation: Solve flag management pain points for large customers and add advanced flag capabilities.

What we will ship:
* **Flag categorization system** – Let customers organize flags into categories and only request the ones they need (addresses ElevenLabs request) <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Automatic stale flag pruning** – Identify and help customers clean up unused flags automatically <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **Flag rollouts based on other flags** – Enable complex rollout strategies where one flag's state determines another's rollout <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />
* **AI IDE Integration** – Build context-aware SDK snippet generation and IDE plugins for Cursor, Windsurf <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

#### Objective 3: Platform Reliability & Scale
Motivation: Create a highly stable, resilient feature flag system capable of supporting 10x growth with enterprise-grade reliability.

What we will ship:
* **Complete /flags rollout** – Roll everyone onto /flags endpoint and deprecate /decide, measure performance improvements <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo />
* **Enhanced observability** – Add tracking for big customer experience, implement alerting and internal SLOs/external SLAs <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo />
* **System resilience** – Decouple flag service from writer database, implement circuit breakers, build remote caches into server-side SDKs <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo />
* **SDK standardization** – Implement unified error handling framework and ensure all SDKs use latest (v2) flags response format <TeamMember name="Andy Zhao" photo />

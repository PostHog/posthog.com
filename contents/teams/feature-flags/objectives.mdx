## Q2 2025 Objectives

### Flag Stability & Consistency, and Resiliency
*Goal: Create a highly stable, consistent, and resilient feature flag system capable of supporting 10x growth*

- Scale `/flags` service
  - Complete 100% worldwide rollout of `/flags` endpoint to all customers
  - Measure and validate improved query performance metrics
  - Document infrastructure cost savings achieved
  - Stretch: Investigate feasibility of decoupling flag evaluation from Postgres entirely

- Standardize SDK Error Handling and UX
  - Move more SDK functionality to the server wherever possible ([reference](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/30466))
  - Implement unified error handling framework across all SDKs
  - Create consistent fallback and default behaviors across platforms
  - Ensure all SDKs utilize the latest (v2) flags response format

- Enhance System Resilience
  - Decouple flag service from writer database
  - Deploy flags on differentiated infrastructure aligned with varying scale needs
  - Implement circuit breakers for graceful degradation during upstream failures
  - Establish reliability SLAs and monitoring for flag delivery
  
### Behavioral Cohort Targeting
*Goal: Enable customers to target feature flags based on user behaviors*

- Ship Beta Release
  - Develop core behavioral targeting functionality
  - Create intuitive UI for defining behavioral cohorts
  - Implement backend services to process and apply cohort rules

- Customer Adoption
  - Identify and onboard 5-10 key customers for beta testing
  - Establish success metrics and collect usage data
  - Document use cases and implementation patterns
  - Create support resources for customer implementation

## AI IDE Integration
*Goal: Streamline developer workflow with AI-powered flag implementation*

- Create Intelligent Code Snippets
  - Develop context-aware SDK snippet generation system for feature flags
  - Ensure generated code follows best practices for each language/framework

- IDE Integration
  - Build plugins/extensions for AI IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, potentially our own)
  - Create seamless workflow from flag creation to code implementation
  - Implement AI-assisted troubleshooting for flag implementation issues

- Developer Experience
  - Measure time-to-implementation improvements
  - Collect developer feedback on integration experience
  - Iterate based on usage patterns and pain points

### Q4 2025 Objectives
This quarter we're making feature flags faster, more reliable, and way more automated. That means better (and more!) SDKs, more powerful local evaluation, supporting real-time use cases, and using AI to handle the tedious stuff. We're also talking to a bunch of users to figure out what to build next, fixing the foundations so nothing breaks, and shipping features that make flags easier to wrangle when you have thousands of them.

#### Awesome documentation <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> driving, shared across the team

Our docs should be as good as the <SmallTeam slug="experiment" />'s. We're partnering with the <SmallTeam slug="content" /> to refresh everything, writing real-world walkthroughs, and making it easier to jump from the app to the right docs.

#### Make local evaluation the default server-side evaluation strategy <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

Local eval means faster, cheaper, and more reliable flags. We want to make it the default for server-side SDKs by:
- Finishing HyperCache integration to decouple `/local_evaluation` from Postgres
- Rewriting the endpoint in Rust for better performance
- Adding ETag support for efficient caching
- Writing better docs and guides; specifically around best practices for including relevant properties alongside the flag when calling e.g. `getFeatureFlag` or `isFeatureEnabled`

#### Ship a Java SDK <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" photo />

Java developers need an official SDK. We're shipping one and iterating based on feedback.

#### Improve SDK standardization <TeamMember name="Dustin Byrne" photo />

Inconsistent SDKs lead to bugs. We're burning down the [SDK standardization meta-issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/31425) to create a consistent experience across the stack.

#### Mature the Cohorts UI/UX <TeamMember name="Gustavo Henrique Strassburger" photo />

Cohorts has been neglected. We're clearing the backlog and fixing UI bugs so cohorts is actually pleasant to use by end of Q4.

#### Real-time feature flags <TeamMember name="Gustavo Henrique Strassburger" photo />

Some use cases need instant flag updates without refreshes or restarts. We're adding WebSocket/SSE-based real-time updates to key SDKs.

#### Finish behavioral cohort targeting <TeamMember name="Gustavo Henrique Strassburger" photo />

We started building a system to track behavioral cohort membership in a fast data store. We're finishing it so you can target flags based on behavioral cohorts.

#### Natural language flag creation <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

Building flags with AI. You describe what you want in plain English, Max builds the flag.

#### Platform improvements <TeamMember name="Dylan Martin" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

Fixing the foundations:
- Finishing the persons database split (shared with ingestion team)
- move our deployment progress from a rollout (this experience was buggy at scale) to a k8s deployment
- Right-size our k8s infrastructure with better alerting on nodepool usage and CPU utilization
- decouple the flags service from the production redis so that we can have 100% redis usage for flag/team reads AND we can isolate flags redis usage from main app redis usage (useful for any future incidents; minimizes the blast radius)
- Decoupling `/flags` from the writer database so flags stay up even when the database is down
- Rewriting `/evaluation_reasons` in Rust
- Deprecating the legacy `/decide` endpoint

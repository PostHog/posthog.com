### Q1 2025 Objectives

The theme for Q1 2025 is "pour gasoline on the fire" â€“ we want to accelerate the remarkable growth of feature flags we saw last year.  To do this, we'll focus on five key areas:

1. Performance & Reliability: Scale our feature flag platform to handle exponential growth while improving speed and dependability
2. Customer-Driven Innovation: Deliver high-impact features that our users are asking for to drive adoption and provide greater value
3. Strategic Research: Map the competitive landscape to identify opportunities for breakthrough features and capabilities
4. SDK Excellence: Strengthen and expand our SDK ecosystem to make feature flag implementation seamless for both new and existing customers
5. UX Enhancement: Continue refining the feature flag experience to make it more intuitive and powerful for all users

More details on each of these areas below.

#### 1. Performance & Reliability
_Owners: @dmarticus, @havenbarnes_
- [Complete migration of feature flag evaluation traffic from the legacy `/decide` endpoint to the new `/flags` endpoint](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/22131) (@dmarticus)
- Establish comprehensive monitoring and observability for the feature flag platform (@dmarticus, @havenbarnes)
  - Enhance Grafana metrics to differentiate between infrastructure failures and logical errors (@dmarticus)
  - Collaborate with infrastructure team to create infrastructure cost analysis and dependency mapping with Michi (@dmarticus)
  - Improve observability of the feature flag evaluation process by tying flag evaluation results to the original request context (@havenbarnes)
  - Experiment with sampling request parameters for high-value customers to have better observability for support requests (@havenbarnes)
  - Implement actionable Sentry alerts in #alerts-feature-flags channel (@havenbarnes)
  - Integrate PostHog error tracking with new flags endpoint (@dmarticus)
- Implement read-only flags (specifics to be defined, see the following [RFC](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/692/files)) (@havenbarnes)

#### 2. Customer-Driven Innovation
_Owners: @dmarticus, @havenbarnes, @haacked_
- [Behavioral cohort targeting for flags](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/14796) (RFC [here](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/683/)) (@dmarticus)
- [Feature management](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:feature/feature-management) (@havenbarnes)
- [Automatically manage flag staleness](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/16497) (@haacked)
- Customer research-driven features (TBD based on the findings of the market research and customer interviews)

#### 3. Strategic research
_Owners: @havenbarnes, @annikaschmid_
- Identify and analyze key user segments:
  1. Current active users
  2. Competitor users
  3. Custom solution implementers
  4. Potential users unaware of feature flagging
- Conduct customer interviews to identify gaps and growth opportunities
- Document findings and recommendations for product roadmap.
- More context [here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/14257)

#### 4. SDK Spike
_Owners: @dmarticus, @havenbarnes, @haacked_
- [Evaluate feasibility and tradeoffs around adding feature flags to the Java SDK](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/16419)
- Investigate improving the Rust SDK (add feature flag evaluation, [implement the suggestions from the open issues](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-rs/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open) etc.)
- [Research .NET SDK demand + feasibility](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/16339)
- Fix open issues in the Python and Node SDKs: ([Python](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-python/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open), [Node](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js-lite/issues?q=sort:updated-desc+is:issue+is:open+label:nodejs))

#### 5. User Experience Improvements
_Owners: @dmarticus, @havenbarnes, @haacked_
Low-hanging, medium-impact, and largely context-free fruit that can be picked up by any team member during available capacity:

- UI Changes
  - [Consolidate boolean and multivariate flag interfaces](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26995)
  - [Show flag evaluation results more clearly in the flag editor UI](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/26995)
  - [Improve the experience of syncing flags between environments](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/21788)
  - Anything else from the [current feature flag backlog](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/112/views/2)

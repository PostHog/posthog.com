## What this team does

We build the feature flag platform, SDKs, API, and UI to help users safely ship new features and make data-driven decisions.  

Here are some of the things we own:

- **Feature flag SDKs** - SDKs in JS/TS, Python, Rust, PHP, Go, Ruby, iOS, Flutter,and Android.
- **Feature flag API** - both the soon-to-be-legacy `/decide` endpoint and the new `/flags` endpoint
- **Flag manager UI** - a way to manage your feature flags in PostHog

We write Rust, Python, and TypeScript.  We're big fans of automated testing, static types, and banter.

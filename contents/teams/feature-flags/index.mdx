## What this team does

We build the feature flag platform, SDKs, API, and UI to help users safely ship new features and make data-driven decisions.  

Here are some of the things we own:

- **Feature flag SDKs** - SDKs in JS/TS, Python, Rust, PHP, Go, Ruby, iOS, Flutter,and Android.
- **Feature flag API** - both the soon-to-be-legacy `/decide` endpoint and the new `/flags` endpoint
- **Flag manager UI** - a way to manage your feature flags in PostHog

We write Rust, Python, and TypeScript.  We're big fans of automated testing, static types, and banter.

## User personas

### Assessing customer fit
Use this guide to determine if a prospect's use case is a good fit for feature flags now, in the future, or at all.

### Engineers (product, growth, software, etc.)
**✅ Fully supported**

They're the primary users of feature flags and get the most value. They can implement flags end-to-end for progressive rollouts, kill switches, canary releases, and targeted feature access without coordination overhead.

**Best fit:** Any engineering team that wants safer deployments and granular release control.

---

### Product Managers
**⏳ Partially supported**

They use flags to control feature rollouts, manage beta programs, and make release decisions independently. However, they typically need an engineer for initial implementation and adding flags to the codebase. Once implemented, they can independently manage flag targeting, rollout percentages, and enable/disable features.

**Coming soon:** AI-assisted flag creation will reduce the engineering dependency by enabling flag generation with natural language prompts.

**Best fit:** PMs who want control over feature releases without deploying code, and have access to engineering resources for initial setup.

### DevOps/Platform Engineers
**⏳ Limited support → Full support planned (further out)**

**What works today:** Can use flags for infrastructure changes, database migrations, and operational toggles. Flags provide safe rollback mechanisms and gradual infrastructure rollouts.

**Coming later:** Infrastructure-as-code integration (Terraform, etc.) to better integrate flags into deployment pipelines.

**Is this customer a fit?**
- ✅ Yes, if they're comfortable managing flags via UI/API
- ⏳ Wait if they require deep IaC integration (coming but no firm timeline)

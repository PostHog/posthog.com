## Q2 objectives

### 😱 OMG so many destinations
- We want to have so many destinations that we cover all the CDP cases people could dream of and, most importantly, the tooling and product to scale this automatically using AI, community templates etc.

### 😍 Data pipelines UI sparks joy
- CDP transformations and destinations are pretty powerful but pretty complex. We want to make it easy to start but give you the complexity when you need it.

### 💪 Pricing
- Our current pricing works for some but not all. We want to make it so that you should be able to try destinations without paying, and pricing should not be a deal-breaker for customers.

## Q1 objectives

### 😍 People choose us for their CDP first
- Focus on getting our positioning, tooling and pricing right so that we are the no brainer here

### 👋 Plugins be gone
- Get custom Hog Transformations out to replace all plugin based ones and entirely remove old Plugins

### 🚀  Warpstream for events
- Test it out like we did for Replay and make it happen

### 🎈 Write-optimized session replay ingestion 
- Change up how we write out replays to simplify the whole system and set us up for the next 12 months of scaling

###  💪 We make changes and improvements to the Node services with confidence
- Finally do the big refactor work we have planned to make working with node.js a dream

### Q1 2026 objectives

#### Goal 1: Feature GA Releases

*Description*: Move several features currently in alpha/beta to general availability.

*What we will ship*:
- **Evaluations** to GA - online LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations for measuring AI output quality
- **Prompts** to GA - prompt management directly in PostHog
- **Clustering** to GA - automatic grouping of similar traces and outputs
- **Errors** to GA - grouped error tracking for LLM applications
- **Sessions** to GA - session-level observability
- **Playground** to GA - interactive testing environment for prompts and models
- **LLM translation** to GA - translation of non-English LLM traces to English
- **LLM trace/session summarization** to GA - AI-generated summaries for quick understanding

#### Goal 2: OpenTelemetry & SDK

*Description*: Add OpenTelemetry support and rethink our SDK architecture to better serve diverse integration patterns.

*What we will ship*:
- **OpenTelemetry support** - native Otel integration for teams using OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- **SDK improvements** - rethink and improve our SDK architecture for better developer experience

#### Goal 3: Evals

*Description*: Continue building out our evaluations system to help teams measure AI output quality at scale. This includes expanding how evaluations can be created and run, and improving how results surface actionable insights.

*What we will ship*:
- **Code-based evaluations** for evaluating LLM outputs using user-defined code evaluators instead of LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Offline evaluations** based on datasets for consistent, repeatable testing
- **Alerts and surfacing** to proactively notify teams of evaluation issues via alerts, news feed, and other channels

#### Goal 4: Ingestion Pipeline

*Description*: Complete our new ingestion pipeline optimized for LLM events, enabling better performance and new capabilities.

*What we will ship*:
- **New ingestion pipeline** launch - dedicated pipeline optimized for LLM events
- **Multimodal support** - ingest and store images, audio, and other media in LLM events

#### Goal 5: Docs, Onboarding & Wizard

*Description*: Make it easier for new users to get started with LLM Analytics across different frameworks and tools.

*What we will ship*:
- **Framework guides** - documentation for every major LLM framework
- **Wizard support** - add LLM Analytics to the PostHog setup wizard for seamless onboarding

#### Goal 6: PostHog AI Integration

*Description*: Integrate LLM Analytics capabilities with PostHog AI to enable powerful search and insights across traces.

*What we will ship*:
- **Agentic search** - find specific traces using natural language queries and get insights
- **Find traces via evals** - search for traces based on evaluation results (passing or failing)
- **Trace/session summarization** via AI - leverage PostHog AI for generating summaries
- **Trace translation** via AI - use PostHog AI for translating traces into English

# 5-year vision

Our goal is to support customers that are 100x the size of our current largest customers, and to ensure that PostHog
remains a trusted source of truth at that scale.

We will do this by focusing on these 3 pillars:
* Scaling systems to handle greater load (e.g. sessions on events, mat col slots)
* New features to support product analytics workflows at large organizations (e.g. schema management)
* Improving platform stability, fixing existing issues and making sure we don't regress (e.g. exports, subscriptions, dashboards)

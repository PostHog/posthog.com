# 5-year vision

Our goal is to support customers that are 100x the size of our current largest customers.

This includes making sure that their queries complete in a reasonable amount of time on a very large dataset, but also considers what it is like to use analytics at massive scale in terms of organisation size.
We want to ensure that such a large org can not only organise their data, but also that they can *trust* data that someone else in a distant part of the org has set up.

We want to ensure that PostHog remains a reliable source of truth as organisations scale.

## Who are we building for?

### Personas

-   Primary Personas:
    -   **Product engineer**
        -   These are the engineers building the product. Normally full-stack engineers skewing frontend or frontend engineers.
        -   Product engineers have more limited time. Need to quickly get high-quality insights to inform what they are building and assess what they've shipped.
    -   **Product manager** (ex-engineer type)
        -   Supports the product teams (engineers, PMs, designers) to build the best products. They guide the product roadmap by speaking to customers and diving into the data.
        -   Product managers are the power-users of analytics (further evidence in the data analysis of paying users). They have desire and the time to go significantly deeper into the data.
-   Limited focus:
    -   Growth engineer
-   Not a focus but should be usable by:
    -   Everyone in the product team (less technical PMs, designers)
    -   Marketing
    -   Leadership team

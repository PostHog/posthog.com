# 1: Scope out alpha and beta versions in an RFC

> Why: a tightly-scoped Alpha prevents scope creep and lets us ship fast. Having a Beta defined beforehand is helpful for prioritization and also to see if our initial plans matched the feedback collected.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />, <TeamMember name="Raquel Smith" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Sandy Spicer" photo />

Prioritizing what to build first based on user interviews, than breaking those down into bite-sized features we can incrementally ship within the quarter.
The output is a the Alpha and Beta versions defined in an RFC.

# 2: Get an alpha version of the CRM out

> Why: have something out as soon as possible so we can collect user feedback and iterate.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />

Code, ship, feedback, repeat. The output is the Alpha version defined in the RFC built.

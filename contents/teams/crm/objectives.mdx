# 1: Figuring out what to build

> Why: we all have opinions and assumptions, but we need to minimally validate those so we don't start building the wrong product.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />

Interviewing users and PostHog folks (perks of being our own ICP) to get the starting feature set of our very own CRM.

# 2: Define what an alpha version looks like

> Why: a tightly-scoped Alpha prevents scope creep and lets us ship fast.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />, <TeamMember name="Raquel Smith" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Sandy Spicer" photo />

Prioritizing what to build first based on user interviews, than breaking those down into bite-sized features we can incrementally ship within the quarter.

# 3: Define what a beta version looks like

> Why: even though we iterate on our products, it is nice to see how our initial plans matched (or not) the actual feedback we're collecting.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />, <TeamMember name="Raquel Smith" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Sandy Spicer" photo />

This is fundamentally the same as goal #2, but looking at a longer horizon.


# 4: Get an alpha version of the CRM out

> Why: have something out as soon as possible so we can collect user feedback and iterate.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />

Code, ship, feedback, repeat.

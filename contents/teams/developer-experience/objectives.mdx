### Q1 2025 Objectives

- Build a framework where we can have 50+ products?
	- Defining and splitting the common layer from the rest of the apps
	- Defining and implementing boundaries between apps
	- UX changes to support the new structure
	- Every product is able to export operations (backend) and widgets (components) => AI, notebooks etc.
	- Testing independently - if you change things on one product, we only run tests for that product
- Levelling up our product quality.
	- Design system that is self documenting
	- Mobile support
	- Finally figure out (explain) modals vs drawers
	- More standardised components
- Anti-goal for Q1:
	- Fixing CI when it randomly breaks (each team owns their tests)
	- Rewrite everything
	- Implement everything ourselves

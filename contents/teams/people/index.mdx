## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people, operations, and culture. This is what we care about:

-   Setting a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for _the_ best people in their field, or people on their way to becoming exceptional at their jobs. This is so important to us, it's enshrined in our [values](/handbook/company/values#talent-compounds).
-   Supporting our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from [making an offer](/handbook/people/compensation), to [onboarding](/handbook/people/onboarding) and [progression](/handbook/people/career-progression), [time off](/handbook/people/time-off), and eventually [parting ways](/handbook/people/offboarding).
-   We create light-touch initiatives, systems, and processes that allow PostHog to act fast and [scale iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration)
-   Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) with a strong sense of belonging is at the heart of everything we do.

## Tools

Here is a summary of some of the tools we've found most effective for getting the job done. You can read more about why we chose them [here](https://posthog.com/blog/startup-ops-toolkit). Fraser and/or Charles are top level admins for all of these, should you need access.

-   [Deel](https://www.letsdeel.com/) - platform for managing all team members and payroll for everybody except in the UK (using their EOR service in certain countries).
-   We use [Middesk](https://www.middesk.com/) to manage all our state registrations and filings on our behalf.
-   For managing our US 401(k) we use [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com), which auto-enrolls all new US hires.
-   UK contracts are currently done manually in Google Drive, with payroll also being run manually - our accountants load up payments in Revolut for us to approve every month. All templates are stored in the _ Legal Docs [CONFIDENTIAL]_ shared Google Drive, in the _Team_ folder.
-   US contracts are also done manually in Google Drive.
-   To avoid emailing PDFs back and forth forever, we use Google e-signature for contracts, Docusign for all other.
-   [PTO by Deel](https://www.tryroots.io/pto) - Slack app for booking all types of time off.
-   [Deel](https://www.deel.com/) - used to store all team personal details, documents, and pay.

### Finance and Banking

Details can be found in `company-internal` [repo here](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/tree/master/finance)

#### Everything Else

-   [Carta](https://carta.com/) is where we manage our cap table. Orrick manage this on our behalf.
-   We use [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/) for all of our insurance coverage, including D&O, Cyber Liability, and Travel.
-   We track everything in [GitHub](https://github.com/) from maintaining this handbook to sprint planning. You can find the People & Ops project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/2?fullscreen=true).

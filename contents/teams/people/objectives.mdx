* **Primary Goals:**
These are goals that _have_ to be done in the quarter:

    * Everyone, especially new people, come away from the offsite having made lots of great connections (Kendal)
    * Stick to our budget and ensure cash burn stays within 5% of forecast (Fraser)
    * Hire people (Coua)
         * Product Engineers for Feature Success, Product Analytics (2x), and Replay
         * Infra Security Engineer
         * Mobile Engineer
         * Distributed Systems Engineer

* **Secondary Goals:**
We want to do these, but not at the expense of the primary:

    * Hire people (Coua)
      * Platform UX Engineer
      * ~4 additional roles TBC once 12 month hiring plan confirmed
    * SOC II monitoring period goes smoothly so we’re on track for certification in July (Fraser)
    * Have a definitive plan for how we manage s174 (Fraser)
    * Merch ops running smoothly and inventory management is all sorted (Kendal)
    * Run another team survey, augmented with anecdotal data from the offsite to turn into a more rounded action plan (Fraser)

    - Platform UX Engineer
    - ~4 additional roles TBC once 12 month hiring plan confirmed
  - SOC II monitoring period goes smoothly so weâ€™re on track for certification in July (Fraser)
  - Have a definitive plan for how we manage s174 (Fraser)
  - Merch ops running smoothly and inventory management is all sorted (Kendal)
  - Run another team survey, augmented with anecdotal data from the offsite to turn into a more rounded action plan (Fraser)

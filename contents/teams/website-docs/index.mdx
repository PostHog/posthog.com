## Values

### 1. Don't follow the crowd

There are hundreds of Linear-style websites out there. We are intentionally not one of them. _Becoming_ the inspiration never started by copying what already existed. It's better to _be copied_ than _to copy_.

### 2. To do it right, we have to do it ourselves

Plenty of services exist to make building websites easier, but they're limited by someone else's creativity. No off-the-shelf solution solves 100% of every problem. In order for us to execute our vision to 100%, we need complete control of the entire experience.
  
### 3. Treat our website as a product

_"Death by a thousand cuts, but a thousand tiny improvements add up"_

Our website isn't a marketing site. It's our primary channel for sales, recruitment, and communicating our company culture and values. Since these are always evolving, we are constantly evolving how we communicate them.

### 4. Spark joy, and continually push back against mediocrity

Doing unique things that unexpectedly delight visitors will pay off dividends over adding more signup CTAs to a page. Building for the long-term pays dividends over optimizing for the short term boost in conversion rate.

### 5. Treat the root cause, not the symptom

Sometimes users (even internal users) don't typically think past the immediate challenge they're facing. Take the time to step back and decide if a bit more thought and effort can make things 10x better.

## Responsibilities

- Ensure PostHog.com is the best resource for learning how to use PostHog
- Support small teams in meeting their goals by providing design and copywriting support
- Hold the line on quality and consistency across all of PostHog's digital experiences

## How we work

Our team works in weekly sprints. We run joint sprint planning sessions with the Marketing team, since we often have projects that overlap. You can find what we're working on in the [company-internal](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5BSPRINT%5D+Marketing+%2B+Website+%26+Docs%3A) repo (private).

Designs for website & docs typically start in Balsamiq wireframes, then progress into hi-fi designs in Figma. [Read more about this process.](/handbook/design/designing-posthog-website)

### Blog artwork and marketing assets

Because of the volume of content we publish, blog artwork has its own dedicated [Artwork](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/14) project board managed by Lottie.

When [authoring a blog post](/handbook/growth/marketing/blog), add the `Artwork` project board so we can create visuals and make sure the post is listed on our [content calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6QYxi46d5y88BQ8vdGWmgrFZBbCMs1CAIc5JGLuf4Y/edit) with a publish date. [Learn more about our process.](/handbook/growth/marketing/exporting-blog-post-image)

## **Providing feedback**

When we share a design, we do our best to explain the type of feedback we're looking for. (Ex: Overall visual aesthetic, flow, if a design communicates to our developer-focused audience, etc.)

If a screenshot is posted directly to a Github issue, that's a great place for feedback. (If a comment already covers your feedback, we encourage the use of an emoji response over additional comments like "+1".)

Some of the design tools we use, like Balsamiq and Figma, both have built-in commenting, which is useful for prototypes with multiple pages. If we provide a link to a prototype in one of these tools, please leave a comment using the app's comment system. This helps us review and take action on comments later, and creates a single place for discussion around a particular topic.

**Important:** We prioritize feedback based on alignment with business goals. _Everyone has feedback about design._ (If feedback is more of a personal opinion than a business-related perspective, we’ll note it, but don't be offended if your feedback isn't specifically addressed!)

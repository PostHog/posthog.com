*What we will ship*: Dedicated pricing, onboarding flow, case study

#### Goal 2: Evals

*Description*: LLM Evals are becoming an important part of monitoring performance of AI applications in production. Evals provide a solution to get quantifiable metrics out of non-deterministic systems.

*What we will ship*: Configuration panel, evals ingestion pipeline, dashboard to view evals, filter by evals

#### Goal 3: Improve cost tracking

### Q3 2025 objectives

#### Goal 1: General Availability Launch of AI Analytics

*Description*: Make AI Analytics (formerly LLM Observability) a fully supported PostHog product available to all customers. This will help teams reliably understand, monitor, and optimize their AI applications at scale.

*What we will ship*: 
- Rebrand LLM Observability to **AI Analytics**
- Comprehensive, easy-to-follow documentation covering all major workflows and SDKs
- Integrated into the onboarding experience to help AI companies discover and set up AI Analytics quickly

#### Goal 2: Evals

*Description*: AI systems are inherently unpredictable, outputs often vary even when inputs are the same. Evals will give teams a structured way to measure output quality, detect regressions, and prioritize improvements as their AI applications evolve.

*What we will ship*:
- Support for **LLM-as-a-judge** evaluations during AI event ingestion
- **Semantic Clustering and Labeling** to group similar outputs and spot patterns
- Ability to run Evals in CI pipelines to catch issues before production
- Tools for creating and managing **Datasets** for consistent, repeatable evaluations

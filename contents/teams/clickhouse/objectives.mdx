**Data Team's Mission at PostHog**

Data Team's mission is to provide a storage and query engine that meets these requirements:
- Continue to meet the needs of the product today now and in the future
- Maintain and optimize our current ClickHouse deployment
- Elastically scale our capacity with little effort
- Support multiple query quality of service (QOS) guarantees (Real-time, Batch, etc.)
- Data is stored once and queryable from the appropriate tool
- Queries are optimized for cost and performance
- Tunable execution performance to allow trade-offs between cost and performance
- Storage is durable

In service of this mission, our goals are:

**Goals for Q1 2026:**

**Resharding (P0)** - _Daniel Escribano_, _Rory Shanks_
- Reshard US cluster to 8 shards

**Storage optimizations (P0)** - _Rory Shanks_
- Tables optimizations (resharding of events_recent, person)
- Drop unused materialized columns
- Rewrite `cohortpeople`
- Track and provide visibility into disk usage cost by team

**Data deletion requests (P0)** - _Jovan Sakovic_
- Enable event deletion from the app based on user-defined predicates (P1)

**Query cost visibility through Chargeback (P1)** - _Pawel Szczur_
- Continue work on chargeback reporting to track query costs
- Provide visibility into expensive queries with tooling to help teams debug and optimize them

**Workload management (P1)** - _Daniel Escribano_
- Implement quotas and workload management to prioritize application queries

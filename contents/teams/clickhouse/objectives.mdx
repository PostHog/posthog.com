**Data Team's Mission at PostHog**

Data Team's mission is to provide a storage and query engine that meets these requirements:
- Continue to meet the needs of the product today now and in the future
- Maintain and optimize our current ClickHouse deployment
- Elastically scale our capacity with little effort
- Support multiple query quality of service (QOS) guarantees (Real-time, Batch, etc.)
- Data is stored once and queryable from the appropriate tool
- Queries are optimized for cost and performance
- Tunable execution performance to allow trade-offs between cost and performance
- Storage is durable

In service of this mission, our goals are:

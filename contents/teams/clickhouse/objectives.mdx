**Data Team's Mission at PostHog**

Data Team's mission is to provide a storage and query engine that meets these requirements:
- Continue to meet the needs of the product today now and in the future
- Maintain and optimize our current ClickHouse deployment
- Elastically scale our capacity with little effort
- Support multiple query quality of service (QOS) guarantees (Real-time, Batch, etc.)
- Data is stored once and queryable from the appropriate tool
- Queries are optimized for cost and performance
- Tunable execution performance to allow trade-offs between cost and performance
- Storage is durable

In service of this mission, our goals are:

**Goals for Q1 2025:**

- Query Scheduling Service
    - Paid API use case is covered
    - We should have all queries running through this
    - Basic load shedding
    - Differentiate API queries based on $
- Iceberg continuation
    - Keep on top of Altinity builds for CH
    - Query logs into Iceberg
    - Ingestion pipeline work (monitoring & automation)
- Cluster topology iteration and cost reductions
    - Query performance is equivalent
    - Costs are down
    - Schema management
- Mutations/Deletes migrated to Dagster for better observability
- Ongoing HogQL/Performance improvements
    - Query Scheduling
    - Productizing Performance Tooling
    - Better query attribution (in query comments)
        - By end of query we do not run queries with no annotations
        - Some sort of Type for queries that will run

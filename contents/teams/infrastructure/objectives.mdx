### ðŸ’ª Deploy with confidence (follow up from Q1)
Our deploy speed keeps us moving fast but bigger changes would benefit from better tooling to gradually roll out, validate and roll back if necessary.

- [ ] Support new rust capture to full release using our new ingress system
- [ ] Finalize our canary deploy process

### ðŸš¨ Improved alerting and monitoring

We have a pretty solid alerting and monitoring solution but there is always room for improvement. There is as much here about scaling to our number of products and teams as there is technical scaling.

- [ ] Improve process around planning and detecting gaps in our alerting
- [ ] Improve capacity planning (process as well as implementation)
- [ ] Alerting on reverse proxy solutions
- [ ] Make the internal tooling around creating alerts to be more opinionated
- [ ] Swap to a more scalable solution for log aggregation

### ðŸ”’ Deeper Security

Security is a never ending journey. We want to do some work to make sure we are ahead of the curve.

- [ ] Extend secret management tooling to more areas
- [ ] Improved logging and auditing

### ðŸ’° Continued cost control
- [ ] Focus on our biggest cost centers where we can make the biggest impact

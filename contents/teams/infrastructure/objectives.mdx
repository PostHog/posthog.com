### 💪 Deploy with confidence
Our deploy speed keeps us moving fast but bigger changes would benefit from better tooling to gradually roll out, validate and roll back if necessary.

- Auto rollbacks with orchestration / blocking new deploys
- Canary deployments
- Load testing
- Investigate something like envoy perhaps to enable traffic shadowing + canary deploys
- Finish helm charts work
- Anomaly detection

### 💰 Keep costs under control
- Keep on top of the great work so far to keep costs under control
- Tackle remaining clear improvements (Cloudfront costs, reserved instances etc.)
- Kafka ops work including tiered storage

### 👀 Yet more Observability  
- CI/CD times (measuring it to know where the pain points are)
- Cost of resources per product 
- Get tracing solution firmly into the hands and minds of teams

### 🎯 Security as a feature
- Investigate pragmatic parts of SOC 2 type II we could already be moving towards

Focusing on improving the user interview process for engineers, have Max answer questions such as:

* I want to interview product engineers that are using product X, give me a list ranked by usage.
* I am about to jump on a call with customer X about Y. What do I need to know about them?

## Who are we building for?

### Personas

- Product engineers: folks who actively work on building the product. They need to know if what they're building is moving the needle in the right direction.
- Technical founders: founders should be obsessed with finding product market fit (PMF) if they haven't already.

### What types of companies?

SaaS startups with 1-15 employees, typically from recent YC batches or similar. These companies have achieved initial traction (first 10-1k customers) and are fighting to retain their users.

## What this team does

We help product engineers and technical founders build products that solve real problems, helping them iterate towards PMF. We do that by giving visibility to the metrics that really matter at this stage and providing customer context to jump on user interviews.

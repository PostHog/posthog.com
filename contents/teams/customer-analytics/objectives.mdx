<summary>1: Customer lists are fast enough to be the default tool for customer lookup</summary>

Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />, [Team analytics platform](/teams/analytics-platform)
<br />

PostHog employees currently prefer other tools for customer lookup because our own customer lists are too slow. This is a non-negotiable enabler for everything else.
<br />

What we'll ship:

- Diagnose query performance issues in customer lists (with Analytics Platform team support)
- Customer list queries under 2 seconds

<summary>2: Engineers can see which customers matter and where they are in the journey</summary>

Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />
<br />

Interviewed users consistently asked: "Where is this user stuck?" and "Who are my most valuable customers?" Combining revenue visibility with journey position answers both questions.
<br />

What we'll ship:

- Revenue data in profiles: current MRR, trend, plan tier, usage vs billing (Stripe users + PostHog one-off implementation)
- Attribution data in profiles (first touch of earliest user for groups)
- Global customer journey funnel: user defines funnel(s) as "the journey," shown in dashboard (aggregate) and profiles (individual position)
- Basic AI-assisted setup with initial prompt to define customer journeys
- Power users table enriched with revenue and attribution columns, sortable
- Customer profile data persistence

<summary>3: Custom properties from data warehouse in persons and groups</summary>

Who: <TeamMember name="Arthur Moreira de Deus" photo />, [Team data stack](/teams/data-stack)
<br />

This is something that comes up quite frequently: have a way to populate properties out of data warehouse and/or materialized views.
<br />

What we'll ship:

- User-defined property schemas that can be populated from data warehouse tables or materialized views
- UI for configuring the schema and properties sync to persons/groups
- Display of custom properties in profiles
- Properties available for cohorts and feature flag targeting

Ownership: Data stack team owns backend/ingestion. Customer analytics owns configuration UI and display.

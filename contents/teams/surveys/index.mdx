## Who are we building for?

### Personas

-   Primary (churn signals product failure):

    -   **Product engineer**
        -   JTBD: Validate assumptions without meetings, tie feedback to behavioral events, minimize eng overhead for survey ops
        -   Why prioritize: Champion persona who instruments + acts on data. Want "instant context" without Slack threads.
    -   **Product manager** (product-minded, technical)
        -   JTBD: Prioritize based on demand signals not opinions, connect feedback to conversion/retention drops, avoid telephone game between users and product
        -   Why prioritize: Key owners of survey processes. Running discovery sprints that need tight feedback loops.
    -   **Growth engineer**
        -   JTBD: Diagnose funnel drop-offs with qualitative context, validate experiment hypotheses, auto-push survey data into workflow tools
        -   Why prioritize: Leverage surveys for rapid experimentation. Minimize cycle lag between signal and action.

-   Somewhat support (should work, churn acceptable short-term):

    -   **UX researcher**
        -   JTBD: Collect feedback at scale for lightweight/high-frequency product triage
        -   Why somewhat: Will churn to specialist tools for complex and rigorous research. Acceptable while we build intelligence layer.

-   Not building for (actively okay with churn):

    -   **Marketing teams**
        -   JTBD: Market research, NPS/CSAT tracking, compliance surveys
        -   Why not: We're product feedback not market research. They need localization, broad external survey tools we won't prioritize.
    -   **Support/CS**
        -   JTBD: Support quality scores, post-ticket satisfaction
        -   Why not: Derivative of product eng workflows. Uses overlap features.

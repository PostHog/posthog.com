### Objective: Surveys

Last quarter we polished up our new surveys UI.
This quarter, we want to address some issues that came up, and then focus on building out some more ambitious features on top of Surveys.

Broadly, we will:
1. Address outstanding experiments UI/UX issues
2. Build no-code experiments
3 Enterprise-3000 for surveys
    * Global CSS
    * Approvals
    * Previews
4 Progress bars for Surveys
5 Back and Forward buttons for Multiple question surveys.
6 Backend events for survey activations.
7 Email surveys, which link out to full-screen surveys/ embed survey questions in them.
8 Work on full-screen survey forms.

### 🌎 Goal 1: Surveys everywhere

> Why: Surveys are way more valuable when tied to your product data

> Who: <TeamMember name="Adam Bowker" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

Make it stupid simple to create surveys from anywhere in PostHog, like:
- If you're looking at a failed Experiment, you should be able to instantly ask those users why
- If you're watching a series of confusing Session Replays, spin up a survey to those users about that flow

Connect the dots between what users _do_ and what they _say_, with zero effort.

### 🤖 Goal 2: Better Integrate PostHog AI with Survey Responses

> Why: PostHog AI can analyze survey responses when you're viewing them, but can't access them from other conversations.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

Enable PostHog AI to access and reference survey responses from any conversation, not just when viewing a specific survey. Users should be able to ask "What are users saying about feature X?" or "Summarize my NPS feedback" from anywhere in PostHog.

### ⭐ Goal 3: Reduce Survey Support Tickets by 30%

> Why: Fix common issues to reduce support burden, especially as we focus on expanding the scope of the Surveys team.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

Another metric to track for this goal: the NPS score over time for Q4. We want to see a upwards trend.

### 🏷️ Side Quest: New Name for the Surveys Team

> Why: Our scope is expanding beyond surveys to encompass all qualitative feedback features.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

In the future, we'll maintain not just Surveys but all qualitative feedback features at PostHog. Leading candidate so far: **Team Feedback**.

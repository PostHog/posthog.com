### 🎨 Goal 1: Survey Platform UX Simplification

> Why: The current survey creation flow is complex. We need to simplify it by organizing surveys by purpose and use case.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

Restructure the surveys experience around specific survey types and use cases:
- Create dedicated pages for different survey types (hosted surveys, metric-based surveys like NPS/CSAT, small in-app feedback collection)
- Figure out our current North Star metrics (Usage + NDR)
- Make it intuitive for users to pick the right survey type for their needs

### 🎯 Goal 2: Product Tours on Public Beta

> Why: Product Tours is a highly requested feature that complements our surveys and feedback collection capabilities.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Adam Bowker" photo />

Ship a limited feature set (Tours, Announcements, Banners) for Product Tours to Public Beta:
- Deliver core Product Tours functionality
- Enabled for everyone (self-serve)
- Come up with a pricing plan

### 🌎 Goal 3: Collective Qualitative Feedback on Autopilot (Surveys Everywhere v2)

> Why: Users shouldn't have to think about "creating a survey" — they should just tell us how they want to collect feedback.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />, <TeamMember name="Adam Bowker" photo />, and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

Evolve the surveys paradigm from "create a survey" to "how do you want to collect feedback":
- Enable feedback collection from feature flags, experiments, and errors
- Make qualitative feedback collection feel automatic and contextual

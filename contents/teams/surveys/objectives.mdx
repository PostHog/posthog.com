# 💰 Goal 1: Pricing

> Why: Making surveys more accessible by revisiting our pricing model.

You’ve told us, and we’ve heard clearly that our pricing for high-volume surveys isn’t competitive. We’re guided by the principles outlined in our [How we make money](https://posthog.com/handbook/how-we-make-money) and [Pricing principles](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/feature-pricing) pages, which remind us not to let pricing be a barrier and to aim to be the most affordable option for each product. In that spirit, we’re revisiting our pricing model with a few ideas in mind, including ways to lower the cost for high-volume surveys and exploring whether single-question surveys can be made more affordable or even free.

# 📣 Goal 2: Marketing

> Why: Increasing awareness and adoption of Surveys through focused outreach.

We're launching two major updates this quarter, new pricing and deeper AI integration. Our core focus is to drive usage, validate product–market fit, and grow our customer base and revenue. However, many users still aren’t aware that surveys are part of our offering. That’s why we’re doubling down on marketing, to reach existing users who haven’t tried Surveys yet, and to attract entirely new customers who could benefit from them.

# 🛠️ Goal 3: Customization

> Why: Expanding the flexibility of Surveys to meet diverse user needs.

Surveys already offer a high degree of customization, but our customers continue to ask for even more flexibility. Last quarter, we introduced several enhancements in this area, and we’re now taking it further by addressing the remaining gaps. This update focuses on expanding customization options to better meet the diverse needs of our users and give them even more control over how surveys look and behave. With these improvements, users will have more ways to tailor the survey experience to fit their brand, product flow, and audience.

# 🧩 Goal 4: Deeper integration with Surveys and AI

> Why: Making survey creation smarter and more contextual with AI.

We're making survey creation more intelligent and contextual. Building on last quarter’s AI-assisted survey creation, we’re going further by deeply integrating AI across the survey workflow. For example, when creating a new experiment, you'll be able to instantly generate a relevant survey with AI, recommending the most appropriate questions based on context from the experiment. The goal is to make survey creation smarter, faster, and more tailored to what you’re working on, right when you need it.

# 📱 Goal 5: Mobile surveys

> Why: Bringing Surveys to mobile-first products with full Android and Flutter support.

Last quarter, we began work on launching mobile surveys and made significant progress, getting close to completion. However, shifting priorities prevented us from fully shipping the feature. This quarter, we’re recommitting to that goal by finishing the work and making surveys fully available across mobile platforms, ensuring a seamless experience on both Android and Flutter. It’s a key step in expanding where and how surveys can be used, unlocking feedback collection across more user touchpoints, especially for mobile-first products.

# 🧭 Stretch Goal: Improve the onboarding experience

> Why: Reducing friction so users can get started with Surveys faster.

We’ve heard from customers that getting started with Surveys can feel too heavy, requiring SDK setup and event tracking before you can explore the feature. This quarter, we’re focused on making the onboarding experience smoother and more accessible, so you can try out Surveys more quickly and with less friction. Our goal is to help you see value sooner and feel confident from the very first step. Ultimately, we want users to feel confident and successful from their very first interaction with Surveys.

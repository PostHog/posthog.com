# Goal 1: Talk to customers

We'll only succeed if we are close to our customers, let's make our relationship with them stronger.

- Do 5 customer interviews
- Find the top 5 reference customers and build a relationship with them
- Do a case study with a top reference customer

# Goal 2: Improve quality

There are a couple of reported bugs that were not addressed quickly, we'd like to speed up this process and fix them.

- Reduce [SLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement) to fix bugs from months to weeks
- Reduce [paper cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingchi) issues by 50%
    - Currently around ~30 [open bugs](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature%2Fsurveys+label%3Abug)

# Goal 3: Finish up [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process) features

We've started and nearly finished a couple of features our customers requested, but they are not [GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#General_availability_(GA)) yet, the goal is to finish them up, gather feedback and put them in front of customers.

- [Partial Responses](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/19300)

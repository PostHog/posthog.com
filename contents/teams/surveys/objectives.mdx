### 🎯 Goal 1: Build the new PostHog Notetaker Product

> Why: Convert conversations into high-signal data for product autonomy - transcripts are easy data for LLMs and work for early-stage companies that can't get survey responses.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

Beta transcription tool with speaker detection, local storage, and PostHog integration. [See more details in this one pager](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/883).

### 🤖 Goal 2: Better Integrate Max with Survey Responses

> Why: Max can analyze survey responses when you're viewing them, but can't access them from other conversations.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

Enable PostHog AI to access and reference survey responses from any conversation, not just when viewing a specific survey. Users should be able to ask "What are users saying about feature X?" or "Summarize my NPS feedback" from anywhere in PostHog.

### ⭐ Goal 3: Reduce Survey Support Tickets by 30%

> Why: Fix common issues to reduce support burden, especially as we focus on expanding the scope of the Surveys team.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo />

Another metric to track for this goal: the NPS score over time for Q4. We want to see a upwards trend.

### 🏷️ Side Quest: New Name for the Surveys Team

> Why: Our scope is expanding beyond surveys to encompass all qualitative feedback features.

> Who: <TeamMember name="Lucas Faria" photo /> and <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" photo />

In the future, we'll maintain not just Surveys but all qualitative feedback features at PostHog. Leading candidate so far: **Team Feedback**.

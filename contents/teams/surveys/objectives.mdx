# ✅ Goal 1: Mobile surveys, Everywhere

We’ve already got mobile surveys working in React Native and iOS, and we’ve kicked off work for Flutter and Android [tracking here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/25085). Next step: bring everything to feature parity with Web.

- ✅ iOS
- ✅ React Native
- 🛠️ Android
- 🛠️ Flutter

# 📈 Goal 2: Level up survey analysis

You asked — we listened. We're making survey analysis more useful and enjoyable, starting with a brand new global analytics page.

- [Global analytics view](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/28418)
- A cleaner, more useful survey responses page
- Extra polish and UX improvements across the board

# 🎨 Goal 3: Survey customization

A lot of people use the API to tweak their surveys. Let’s bring those use cases into the product.

- Better wait period controls
- [Alignment customization](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/28479)
- [Inline surveys](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/30097)
- A handful of other power-user options

# 💬 Goal 4: Make Key Customers Super Happy

We’ve had some great convos with customers — now let’s turn those into lasting partnerships.

- Build a case study with a power user
- Be lightning-fast at resolving their issues

# 🧰 Goal 5: Templates, Templates, Templates

Right now, duplicating and customizing surveys across projects/environments isn’t great. Let’s fix that.

- [Save custom templates](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/27309)
- [Duplicate surveys across projects/environments](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/29138)
- Add mobile-specific templates
- Explore using AI to create survey templates

# 🧑‍💻 Goal 6: Hire a Cracked Product Engineer

The team’s growing! We’re hiring a Product Engineer to help us build faster and better.

- Hire and onboard our next teammate
- Make onboarding smooth and fast so they can hit the ground running

# ✨ Goal 7: Improve the Onboarding UX

We noticed that users are dropping off when trying to get started with Surveys — let’s fix that.

- Shift SDK installation to after the first survey is created
- Make the path from "try Surveys" to "see results" as smooth as butter

# 🎯 Side Quests (Stretch Goals)

We started these, but shifted priorities a bit. Still aiming to wrap them up if time allows.

- [Adaptive survey sampling](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/25722)
- [Survey actions](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/27378)

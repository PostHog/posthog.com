## Values

### 1. Progress is always more important than process

We can be a chaotic team, but that's OK because we're also good at getting stuff done. We'll create process when it's helpful, but if it's a choice between doing something good/fast and doing something "properly", we'll choose good/fast. We encourage each other not to ask for permission on things. 

### 2. Sparking joy is a multidisciplinary, inclusive job

There's no such thing as "just a writer" or "just a designer" here. It is everyone's responsibility to say "Yes, and", and to push the brand further. Don't worry about being too weird; worry about not being weird enough. 
  
### 3. We're not an 'ideas' team

You know the type of 'Ideas' person who comes up with big ideas but doesn't do anything with them, or tries to get someone else to do it? Yeah, we hate people like that too. We ship things and, wherever possible, we ship them all by ourselves. 

## Responsibilities

- Merch and all related creative work
- Customer-facing communications
- Emails, ads, and other non-content marketing
- Special programs, such as PostHog for Startups and YC
- Product launches
- Events, when they happen

## How we work

We work in weekly sprints. You can find what we're working on in the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues">company-internal</PrivateLink> repo, where we put together a planning issue for each sprint.

We also have <PrivateLink url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MmNUd9fFlZM3-SDk-HQ9cOmBY8XtqT7F97JFOAehxh8/edit?usp=sharing">a budget</PrivateLink>, which is nice even if we had to split some of it with the Content & Docs team. 

Because we're a creative team we try to use sprints for getting feedback and involving each other, rather than just reciting a list of things we work on. We want the conversation to be inclusive, fun, and functional - more 'show and tell', less 'here's a status update'.

Like other teams, we plan our goals quarterly. Every goal gets assigned an owner who then puts an issue together outlining some of their ideas and steps towards that goal. These issues go [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/).

When we plan product launches or widescale user messaging activities, we begin by drafting a plan [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/). There's a template for messaging activities if other teams want to request work.

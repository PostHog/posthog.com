## 2x-ing upper-funnel content

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** We want to build a repeatable system for refreshing existing content and expand our upper-funnel library to capture more organic traffic. The goal is to make our content engine more sustainable, ensuring older articles stay current while consistently adding new ones that meet users earlier in their discovery journey.

**What we'll ship:**

* Test AirOps as a tool to refresh existing articles at scale, optimizing them for both traditional search and LLM visibility. This includes updating metadata, improving page structure for LLM readability, refreshing content, and ensuring all PostHog features and positioning are current.
* Create new upper-funnel content (alternatives, listicles, etc.) that targets high-volume keywords and attracts users in the awareness and consideration stages across all product categories.

**We'll know we're successful when:**

* We’ve established a repeatable refresh workflow that improves LLM visibility and keeps articles accurate and current.
* We have strong upper funnel content coverage capturing high-volume searches across all product categories
* LLM outputs reflect accurate, up-to-date info about PostHog.  
* We see steady growth in visibility from both traditional search and LLM outputs.

## Sharpening our AEO strategy

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** We want to ensure PostHog is represented accurately and prominently in LLM outputs by tracking prompts, monitoring citations, and running experiments to see how optimized and new content can influence the answers these models generate.

**What we'll ship**

* Roll out an AEO tracking tool to monitor prompts and citations at both a general and per-product level.  
* Run a Q4 “blitz” on error tracking as treatment vs control to measure AEO impact before scaling.  
  * Create and/or optimize content specifically for LLMs   
  * Pilot YouTube as an AEO lever via prescriptive creator briefs

**We'll know we're successful when**

* We have end-to-end visibility on how PostHog shows up in LLMs across products  
* Key competitor and product prompts consistently surface PostHog in accurate, positive ways and echo our developer tool positioning  
* We can measure the impact of AEO efforts and expand proven tactics across product lines.

## Better reporting on content performance

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** Right now, performance data is scattered and often looked at in isolation. We want to introduce a structured monthly content performance review to give the team clearer visibility across products, spot trends, and use those insights to guide planning, prioritization, and decision-making.

**What we'll ship**

* A recurring monthly content review  
* Dashboards and supporting materials

**We'll know we're successful when**

* The team has clear visibility into how content is performing at both an overall and per-product level.  
* Everyone can access and understand key metrics without needing to dig.  
* Insights from reviews consistently shape our content planning and prioritization.

## Newsletter

**Owner:** Ian Vanagas

**Motivation:** We've scaled back our paid acquisition with the newsletter, because it was bringing in low quality subscribers and clouding our ability to understand how the newsletter is performing. If we want the newsletter to be successful for the long term, we need it to grow organically.

**What we'll ship:**

- A great newsletter every two weeks  
- Audit of subscriber list to remove inactive subs  
- 3 social (primarily LinkedIn) posts per newsletter to build our social posting muscle

**We'll know we're successful when:**

- We're growing our newsletter audience organically
- We are confident the newsletters we are publishing are performing well

## Better high-level messaging

**Owner:** Ian Vanagas

**Motivation:** We’ve had a lot of changes in terms of positioning of the company lately and that has left a scattering of messaging across our site, content, and how we talk about ourselves. 

**What we'll ship:**

- A marketing handbook page with key messaging, such as  
  - What is PostHog?  
  - What are the benefits of using PostHog?  
  - Why use PostHog over other options?  
- Update pages that talk about these things to be consistent  
- A statement we can use everywhere

**We'll know we're successful when:**

- Our own team and content is using this messaging more  
- We hear that messaging back from users  
- People on social media use this messaging, instead of "product analytics"

## Ship the product engineer handbook this time

**Owner:** Andy

**Motivation:** We want to completely own the concept of the Product Engineer by creating its central text. We're 80% of the way there. Need to ship final 20%.

**What we'll ship:** 

* Intro chapters of the handbook using a similar structure to the company handbook.

**We'll know we're successful when**

* We've shipped the first version of the guide  
* Positive initial reaction from our users and readers  
* Ranking for product engineer keywords in search  
* Incoming users convert to reading other parts of guide  
* Converting handbook readers to subscribers of the newsletter

## Anti-goals

* Digital PR (both on the community side with Reddit and GitHub, and on the PR outreach side for publications); it's something that could help us move the needle with LLMs, but not a priority in the short or medium term.  
* Multimedia product comparisons. Could be a strategic advantage, not something we have capacity to take on right now  
* Figuring out long term newsletter strategy

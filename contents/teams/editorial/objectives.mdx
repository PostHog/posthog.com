## Nail the content growth review

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** The foundation exists, but we need this to be a real, recurring ritual that actually shapes what we do.

**What we'll ship:**
- Monthly Content Growth Review on a locked-in cadence
- Streamlined reporting that pulls SEO, AEO, and newsletter metrics into one place
- A clear "so what" section with actionable next steps that feed into planning

**We'll know we're successful when:**
- We've run the review every month this quarter, no skips
- Insights from reviews have meaningfully influenced content decisions
- The team knows where we stand without needing to ask

## New upper-funnel content on a consistent cadence 

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** We need a sustainable rhythm for LLM/SEO-optimized content production that balances growth with maintenance.

**What we'll ship:**
- New upper-funnel content on a consistent cadence 
- Ongoing optimization of existing articles, including refreshing metadata, updating positioning, improving structure for LLM readability, and ensuring PostHog features are current

**We'll know we're successful when:**
- New articles are ranking first page for target keywords
- Optimized articles show measurable improvement in traffic, rankings, or citations/mentions post-refresh
- This feels like a system, not a scramble

## More people writing newsletters

**Owner:** Jina Yoon

**Motivation:** A lot of the responsibility for the newsletter has been with a small set of people, there are many more people at PostHog who could contribute, whether that is through research or literally writing articles. 

**What we'll ship:**
- A better, clearer contribution guide
- Newsletters by people other than Ian, Andy, Charles, and James
- Internal efforts to encourage people to write newsletters (onboarding item, promoting in `#tell-posthog-anything`, etc.)
- Social promotion of those newsletters by them too

**We'll know we're successful when:**
- Jina ships at least two newsletters
- Four people outside our regular contributors ship (or scheduled to ship) a newsletter (Jina and Cleo are already scheduled, so we need 2 more)
- We've got people lined up to work with us on newsletters, it's clearer how to work with us.

## New series

**We'll know we're successful when:**
- We've published at least the first post in the new series

- Readers want more

## Social posters unite

**Owner:** Ian Vanagas

**Motivation:** Our team ships all the time, we should be posting all the time too

- Hire a social person and get them up to speed
- Test more native content as well as channels like X and Reddit

**We'll know we're successful when:**

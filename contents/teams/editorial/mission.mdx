1. **Publish so much, so good.** We ship a lot as a company, we should also publish a lot as a team. This means getting more people up to speed and involved, including those not on our team. It means reusing the work we've already done to go further (like socials). Add content automations, tighter processes, more repeatable formats, and new channels so we can be in more places, all the time.

2. **Tie it better to PostHog.** First, we're often the first way someone hears about PostHog. We should be sharing what's important to the company. If PostHog focuses more on AI and data stack, so should we. Second, we should tie to other efforts related teams are working on (sales, paid ads, talent). Third, we should tie to data in PostHog to help us figure out the success of what we've done and what to work on next.

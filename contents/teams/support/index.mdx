## Values

### 1. Being hands-on is the best way to be helpful

It'd be very easy for us to say that we only handle support – that things like bug fixes, docs updates, and content aren't our job. We want to avoid doing that. If helping anyone – whether a colleague or customer – is within our capabilities then we'll jump in. Sometimes we'll jump in anyway. 

### 2. Process shouldn't come above anything else

We're constantly improving our processes to make them more performant and scalable. But if process gets in the way of delighting a user, accelerating a project, or otherwise Doing Good Things, then it's a bad process. It's better to break a rule than break a user's trust.
  
### 3. It's not just about the tickets

We care about solving tickets, but they aren't the be-all and end-all. We don't judge individual performance based just on how many tickets someone answers, and we regularly ship big-picture work that involves putting tickets aside temporarily - and we think that's OK. 

## Responsibilities

- Handling customer support tickets
- Facilitating the success of our users

## Metrics we care about

- [CSAT responses and user comments](https://us.posthog.com/project/2/surveys/018d1739-070f-0000-e5e7-60d9e66cb429)
- [Escalation rates and ticket performance for other teams](https://posthoghelp.zendesk.com/explore/dashboard/precanned/00ED29FD6878842D011808EA714C5F470227102AAEF5CC3C1C706E448CF61B73)

## How we work

<p>We work in weekly sprints. You can find what we're working on in the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues">company-internal</PrivateLink> repo, where we put together a planning issue for each sprint.</p>

Like other teams, we plan our goals quarterly. Every goal gets assigned an owner who then puts an issue together outlining some of their ideas and steps towards that goal. These issues go [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/).

When we plan product launches or widescale user messaging activities, we begin by drafting a plan [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/). There's a template for messaging activities if other teams want to request work. 

Every week, on Monday morning, we put together a weekly report on the main support metrics for the Exec team, which is posted in the #team-exec Slack channel along with comments from CSAT surveys. Every two weeks we post a summary report in #tell-posthog-anything containing a bit more context and highlights.

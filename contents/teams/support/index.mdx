## How we work

<p>We work in weekly sprints. You can find what we're working on in the <PrivateLink url="https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/issues">company-internal</PrivateLink> repo, where we put together a planning issue for each sprint.</p>

Like other teams, we plan our goals quarterly. Every goal gets assigned an owner who then puts an issue together outlining some of their ideas and steps towards that goal. These issues go [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/).

When we plan product launches or widescale user messaging activities, we begin by drafting a plan [in the Meta repo](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/). There's a template for messaging activities if other teams want to request work. 

Every week, on Monday morning, we put together a weekly report on the main support metrics for the Exec team, which is posted in the #team-exec Slack channel along with comments from CSAT surveys. Every two weeks we post a summary report in #tell-posthog-anything containing a bit more context and highlights.

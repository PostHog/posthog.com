### Deflect common implementation-related tickets with SDK doctor
- **Owner:** <TeamMember name="Steven Shults" photo />, <TeamMember name="Luke Belton" photo />
- **Rationale:** Providing customers with a tool to check common implementation issues / mistakes = fewer tickets related to these
- **What we'll ship:** A tool available to customers in the side panel to help diagnose SDK implementation issues
- **We'll know we're successful when:** SDK doctor exists in the side panel, reliably detecting at least 3 common issues, and the tool is accessible to some customers.

### Improve support experience with Max AI 
- **Owner:** <TeamMember name="Ben Lea" photo />, <TeamMember name="Ben Haynes" photo />
- **Rationale:** Encouraging customers to use Max AI will decrease the number of support tickets, allowing us to focus time and effort on more complicated tickets.
- **What we'll ship:** Improvements to the way Max is used in the support sidebar so that more customers are directed to use Max AI and/or their questions are run through Max AI as a precursor to sending the ticket to support.
- **We'll know we're successful when:** The support contact rate is decreasing.
- **Stretch goal:** Allow customers to submit support requests via Max AI and get Max to help formulate a more useful support request for us (i.e. with chat history with Max etc).

### Integrate error tracking information back into the app
- **Owner:** <TeamMember name="Joshua Ordehi" photo />, <TeamMember name="Luke Belton" photo />
- **Rationale:** Providing more information about error tracking, including GitHub issue if it exists etc, should reduce the need for customers to create tickets when they encounter an error in-app.
- **What we'll ship:** Integrate our error tracking and information into error handling in-app
- **We'll know we're successful when:** We receive fewer tickets with just the error pasted or saying 'I encountered this error'.

### Create a strategy for Community and GitHub support 
- **Owner:** <TeamMember name="Abigail Richardson" photo />
- **Rationale:** More community engagement = more happy customers = good word of mouth
- **What we'll ship:** A strategy for getting more involved in community and GitHub issues raised by customers
- **We'll know we're successful when:** The support team are starting to respond more on community tickets and we have a strategy for dealing with customer-raised GitHub issues.

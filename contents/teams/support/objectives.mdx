### Improve efficiency and consistency of how we use Zendesk (Ben)
- **Rationale:** Less confusing Zendesk = more consistency across support and more efficient support.
- **What we'll ship:** Improvements to, simplification of, and clarity around Zendesk procedures and implementation. This will include reviewing the way that we use views, statuses, ticket fields, tags, macros, triggers, and automations. The goal is to streamline our workflow and make it clearer what the support team should be looking at and what engineers should be looking at. The implementation in Zendesk at the moment is a bit cumbersome, leading to some confusion about what support heroes should be looking at, alert fatigue, and occasionally tickets getting lost. This goal will include both changes in Zendesk and handbook updates.
- **We'll know we're successful when:** The first resolution time and full resolution time metrics are going down. SLA achievement should also be improved.

### Streamline support workflow by implementing features in ZenHog (Haynes)
- **Rationale:** Improved support tooling = support can ship things faster.
- **What we'll ship:** Integration with GitHub issue creation, links to user’s org’s Vitally and Stripe, and information / solution from related tickets.
- **We'll know we're successful when:** The support team is actively using these tools and feeling less encumbered.

### Optimize Max AI in the sidebar (Steven)
- **Rationale:** Better Max = more case deflection = more time for support to spend on more complex tickets.
- **What we'll ship:** Optimized Max (details coming soon to a GitHub issue near you).
- **We'll know we're successful when:** Max is regularly deflecting a good number of tickets and that number is increasing with optimizations.

### Everyone in support is an SME (Abigail)
- **Rationale:** SMEs = less escalations to engineering = we ship more things.
- **What we'll ship:** Framework and resources for developing SMEs in selected product areas. Implement these and train the current team as SMEs.
- **We'll know we're successful when:** The percentage of escalated tickets is decreasing in areas that we have trained SMEs.

## Q1 2025 Goals

* Finish building **cookieless prototype** <TeamMember name="Robbie Coomber" photo />
  * This is being carried over from Q4, but it's almost done, and it has a lot of impact, so it makes sense to keep it as a goal for this quarter
* **Marketing Analytics** <TeamMember name="Robbie Coomber" photo />
  * Get revenue data from events, and from 1-2 data warehouse connectors (most likely Stripe and RevenueCat)
  * Display revenue data inside the web analytics dashboard
  * Get ad spend data from 2-5 data warehouse connectors (most likely Google Ads and CSV files, then other ad platforms that we can dogfood)
  * Build out the 80/20 of marketing analytics insights, e.g. total revenue and spending per channel and per campaign
  * Start on more advanced features, e.g. CPA (average for channel) as a person property
* **Per-page Analytics** <TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo />
  * **Core web vitals**
    * We're already collecting this data, so it's just a matter of displaying it
  * Improve cross-selling inside per-page view
    * Analytics conversion/funnels cross-sell
    * Heatmaps/Session Replay cross-sell
    * Error Tracking cross-sell
  * React Performance
  * Uptime monitoring
    * Figure out a way to make it different from the 250 alternatives
    * Initial proposal: allow customers to select the region where we hit their website from (`us-east`, `us-west`, `eu-central`, `eu-west`, `sa-east`, etc.), more reliable metrics 
  * Add per-page analytics to the Toolbar view
    * Web Analytics data will be much more useful if we can display it when using the toolbar, so, stretch goal: display this kind of information in an overlay when using the toolbar
* **Define more sophisticated success metrics** to better understand how much our users value the product <TeamMember name="Anna Szell" photo />
  * Activation, retention, etc.
  * Performance (query-loading speed, total page load speed, etc.)
    * Check in mid-quarter, and then decide if we should spend time working on the current set of features or if we should focus on the above goals

### Stretch Goals

* The web analytics dashboard for www.posthog.com is publicly shared as a **demo on the web analytics product page** <FutureTeamMember />

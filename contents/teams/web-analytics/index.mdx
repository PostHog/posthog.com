## Who are we building for?

### Personas

-   Primary Personas:

    -   **Technical Founder**
        -   First technical person at the company, responsible for setting up the initial landing page.
        -   At an early stage, wants tools that initially cost little to nothing, but won't need to be replaced as the company grows.
    -   **Product engineer**
        -   These are the engineers building the product. Normally full-stack engineers skewing frontend or frontend engineers.
        -   Product engineers have more limited time. Need to quickly get high-quality insights to inform what they are building and assess what they've shipped.

-   Not a focus, but should be usable by:
    -   Other engineers
    -   Marketing
    -   Everyone in the product team (PMs, designers)
    -   Non-technical leadership

### What types of companies?

- We are building web analytics for high-growth startups that have PMF. Our product should be useful for them right from the start.

### Jobs to be done

Web analytics is an _opinionated_ tool, that will help people:

-   Measure and improve the effectiveness of their acquisition strategy
-   Measure and improve the effectiveness of their conversion funnels
-   Understand who is using their website
-   Understand how their website is being used
-   Create simple-to-medium complexity combinations of these (e.g. how likely are people who came in from this ad to convert, compared to everyone else)

Additionally, it should be:

-   Easy to set up
-   Easy to use
-   It's ok if that means we don't cover every use case, as people who need more can use [product analytics](/dashboards)

## Roadmap

### 5-year vision

**Web analytics as the command center**
Web analytics becomes the central command hub for everything that happens on the web. It unites acquisition, performance, and behavior data in one intelligent view. It is the 80/20 dashboard for all related PostHog products, connecting directly to experiments, sessions, and insights. No longer a passive reporting tool, it’s where teams take action.

**From reactive to proactive**
Analysis turns into action. Web analytics doesn’t just highlight regressions; it solves them. When conversion rates drop or core web vitals slip, it can open a GitHub PR, create a task, or launch a follow-up experiment automatically.

**A self-optimizing web**
Everything related to the web lives here: marketing spend, attribution, churn risk, SEO/AEO/GEO, and performance metrics, all in one continuous feedback loop. PostHog AI connects the dots across marketing, performance, and behavior, finding opportunities for improvement, generating new assets or variants, and running experiments autonomously.

**From chart-drilling to conversations**
Instead of drilling into dashboards, users simply chat with web analytics. They ask questions, get clear explanations, and receive ready-to-apply actions, all in natural language. The focus shifts from just analyzing data to acting on insights.

**Analytics for the agent era**
As AI agents and LLMs become real web users, PostHog helps teams measure, understand, and optimize for them. Web analytics will distinguish between agent traffic and human traffic, paving the way for the area and empowering teams to tailor their experiences for both human and AI audiences.

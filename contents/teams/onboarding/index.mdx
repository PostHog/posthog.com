## Responsibilities

## Principles

**No sales-y talk** - we are direct, open and honest with customers. We share as much as possible publicly, rather than hiding it behind a mandatory demo call. We are honest when we don't know the answer, or if we're not sure that PostHog is the right solution for a customer.

**Engineers helping engineers** - there is nothing more frustrating than talking to a person who can't give you all the answers. We keep 'let me find out from the team' to an absolute minimum.

**Being power users of PostHog is a must** - otherwise we won't be credible. PostHog is a big and growing platform, so this is a challenge to stay on top of!

## Who are we building for?

### Personas

-   Primary Personas:
    -   **Data/Analytics Engineer**
        -   These are the engineers building and maintaining the whole data stack, and are also responsible for providing the best tooling for their company.
        -   They want flexibility and control of every part of the stack to ensure correct reporting downstream. 
    -   **Data Analysts/Product Managers** (technical type)
        -   They are responsible for providing insights for their teams/company. If a question can be answered by data, they will write complex SQL models to get to the answer.
        -   Data analysts and product managers are the power-users of data modeling and business intelligence (BI). They have the desire and the time to go significantly deeper into the data.
-   Limited focus:
    -   Product engineer
-   Not a focus but should be usable by:
    -   All other engineers, e.g. they should have access to the data they need, and easily query it

### Q2 2025 Objectives

As a shiny new product within PostHog's suite of tools, the overall goal for Q2 2025 is to deliver value and get feedback quickly. To do this, we'll focus on the following key areas:

1. Transactional email: Trigger message delivery from webhooks or PostHog event occurrences
2. Automations: Dead simple workflows so that users can customize their outreach with filtering, time delays, and conditions
3. GenAI Integration: MaxAI is smart - we'll let users leverage his intelligence for both message content and automated workflows
4. Observability: Just because our product is new, doesn't mean it has to be confusing or difficult to monitor. We'll make sure every
  message sent (or not sent) has clear reporting signals so that both us and our users can easily understand what happened

## What the heck is the Website & Vibes Team?!

The Website & Vibes team is responsible for making PostHog _not_ feel like every other tech company. We primarily work on PostHog.com (design, copy, overall UX architecture, and development), but also try to inspire the rest of the team to think outside the box to avoid default tech company mediocrity. We also jump around in the product a bit (as time allows) to 10x parts of the experience.

## Objectives

- Help the team stay true to the brand
- Guide the emotion of PostHog's identity
- Retain authenticity (and quirkiness) while being seen as a respected and trustworthy brand
- Bring delight to everyone who uses PostHog – both on the website and in the product

## Values

### 1. Don't follow the crowd

There are hundreds of Linear-style websites out there. We are intentionally not one of them. _Becoming_ the inspiration never started by copying what already existed. It's better to _be copied_ than _to copy_.

### 2. To do it right, we have to do it ourselves

Plenty of services exist to make building websites easier, but they're limited by someone else's creativity. No off-the-shelf solution solves 100% of every problem. In order for us to execute our vision to 100%, we need complete control of the entire experience.
  
### 3. Treat our website as a product

_"Death by a thousand cuts, but a thousand tiny improvements add up"_

Our website isn't a marketing site. It's our primary channel for sales, recruitment, and communicating our company culture and values. Since these are always evolving, we are constantly evolving how we communicate them.

### 4. Spark joy, and continually push back against mediocrity

Doing unique things that unexpectedly delight visitors will pay off dividends over adding more signup CTAs to a page. Building for the long-term pays dividends over optimizing for the short term boost in conversion rate.

### 5. Treat the root cause, not the symptom

Sometimes users (even internal users) don't typically think past the immediate challenge they're facing. Take the time to step back and decide if a bit more thought and effort can make things 10x better.

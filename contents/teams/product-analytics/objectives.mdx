### Q3 2025 objectives

* **Data warehouse support in insights** (Thomas)
  * A query using data warehouse and events tables, with complex joins can be implemented using UI only.

* **Query node migration system** (Thomas)
  * We can evolve the schema of query nodes in non-trivial ways e.g. renaming a property or changing the type of a property.
  * Frontend side query nodes are migrated or gracefully discarded.

* **Paths V2 follow-ups** (Thomas)
  * The V2 version of the insight has feature parity with V1 and is rolled out to users.

* **Insight colors follow-ups** (Thomas)
  * The dashboard breakdown colors feature supports all insights.
  * The insight colors feature supports all insights, by adding a modal to allow customization of colors and handling the customizations in all chart types.

* **Alerts** (Anirudh)
  * Migrate to temporal from celery
  * Alert notifications in slack (supported from CDP destinations)

* **Statistical analysis** (Anirudh working with Anna)
  * Confidence intervals
  * Forecasting
  * Trend lines
  * (stretch) Root cause analysis

* **AI generated insights** (Anirudh)
  * Suggested insights section (above all insights maybe)
    * Once we have the users data, we can figure out what insights to generate (from say signup events,...) maybe even create entire dashboards
  * Related charts
    * When users are looking at a funnel step, we can suggest an autogenerated insight that shows dropoffs from the funnel step. Similar to related charts on Amplitude, we can dedicate a section to this on applicable insights

* **Improve Insight / Dashboard Load Times** (Sandy)
  * Figure out EU database performance issues
  * Investigate top reasons why dashboard insights are not cached or are recalculated
  * Look into improving caching
    * Move cache warming to temporal
  * Edit Mode for Insight

* **Improve Exports** (Sandy)
  * Move them to temporal
  * Better alerting when fail (tell the user why, especially OOM, suggest less columns)
  * Think about increasing limits or helping the user with pagination

* **Action Improvements** (Sandy)
  * Saved Filters
  * Investigate warehouse enabled actions (for insights that support it)

* **Passwords for shared dashboards** (Sandy)

* **Onboarding improvements** (Anna)
  * Working together with #team-growth, we should continuously improve new user experience

* **Insight tabs / unified "data explorer"** (Anna)
  * Figure out the UX

* **AI taxonomic filters**

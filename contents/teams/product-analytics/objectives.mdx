### Q3 2025 objectives

* **Improve the UX around loading and performance**
  * Make refreshing more subtle on dashboards with existing data (just light grey spinner)
  * Create a metric that tracks how often people are triggering manual refreshes
    * If this is large, attempt to drive it down with improvements to cache warming or UX (while not overly burdening ClickHouse)

* **Infrastructure improvements**
  * Port things that are being affected by Celery unreliability to Temporal
    * Async `/query` calls triggered when the FE blocking queries are backed up
    * Cache warming

* **Feature development**
  * PW-protected shared dashboards (hashed password)
  * Using Data Warehouse tables in funnel steps

* **Increase featureset**
  * Pinned dashboard filters
  * Event usage counts -> enable taxonomic filter improvements
  * Event management (borrowed properties?)
  * Nightly / timed dashboard calculation 

* **Figure out how to triage feature requests for the team** (Anna)

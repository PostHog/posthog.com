### Q3 2024 objectives

1.  Rock-solid analytics (Thomas + Julian + Sandy + Anirudh)
    
    1.  Legacy Minus – removing legacy insights code so that we can move fast
        -  FilterType gone from the frontend.
        -  rm -rf posthog/queries/
        -  Experiments ported to HogQL.
        -  All the flags from HogQL/querying work.
    2.  Tests Plus – shipping fewer bugs in the first place
        -  Ensure we test with the feature flags that users actually experience, both in end-to-end and integration tests.
        -  When shipping changes to queries, replay old vs. new version on thousands of real queries to check for regressions.
    3.  Metrics Plus – catching issues before before users report
        -  Analytics performance dashboard in Grafana (query duration, failures, etc.). Paging alerts on critical metrics, e.g. if the number of queries drops rapidly, or failures rise.
        -  Analytics experience dashboard in PostHog (time till data available, result freshness across insights and subscriptions, refreshes initiated manually vs. automatically, etc.)
        -  Alerts on major Product Analytics errors from Sentry, and us acting on every alert. (Bonus: checking up the Sentry routing rules for the #product-analytics team.)
        -  Cohorts dashboard in Grafana (successful vs. failed calculations per day, recalculation backlog). Alerts here too.
    4. Performance Plus - eliminating UX pain via maximum query performance/reliability, based on Metrics Plus data
        - Partial calculation of multi-day time series results
        - …and more – work with Team Query Performance to find the lowest-hanging fruit, similarly to [Tim's performance mega issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/22413)
    5.  Support Plus – sparking joy for users when they’re led to report a bug
        -  1 hero + 1 sidekick
        -  Goal: 90% of tickets fulfill the SLA
2.  Answering more product questions, deeper (Thomas + Julian + Sandy + Anirudh)
    1.  Growth Plus - increasing ease of onboarding, and subsequent retention
        - Identify growth opportunities working with Anna, our product manager – implement growth optimizations and track their impact whenever possible.
        - Work with Team Growth on optimizing the onboarding experience of Product Analytics.
    2. Analysis Plus - answering more product questions, more deeply
        -  Analytics alerts are out to users (implemented with the contributor)
        -  “Done for the first time” in Trends, to kill the janky First Time Event Plugin
        -  Query in new insight URL for instant insight sharing
        -  Optional funnel steps
        - ...and more, based on user feedback - see the [most requested features in GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ateam%2Fproduct-analytics+sort%3Acomments-desc)
3.  ArtificialHog (Michael + Georgiy) – an LLM-based chat-like interface for answering product questions.

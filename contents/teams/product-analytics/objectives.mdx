### Q3 2025 objectives

* **Improve the UX around loading and performance**
  * Make refreshing more subtle on dashboards with existing data (just light grey spinner)
  * Create a metric that tracks how often people are triggering manual refreshes (Anirudh)
    * If this is large, attempt to drive it down with improvements to cache warming or UX (while not overly burdening ClickHouse)
    * Improve cache warming efficiency

* **Infrastructure improvements**
  * Port things that are being affected by Celery unreliability to Temporal
    * Async `/query` calls triggered when the FE blocking queries are backed up
    * Cache warming
  

* **Feature development**
  * PW-protected shared dashboards (hashed password)
  * Using Data Warehouse tables in funnel steps
  * Pinned dashboard filters
  * Event usage counts -> enable taxonomic filter improvements
  * Event management (borrowed properties?)
  * Nightly / timed dashboard calculation 

* **Figure out how to triage feature requests for the team** (Anna)


* **AI generated insights** (Anirudh)
  * Suggested insights section (above all insights maybe)
    * Once we have the users data, we can figure out what insights to generate (from say signup events,...) maybe even create entire dashboards
  * Related charts

* **Statistical analysis** (Anirudh working with Anna)
  * Confidence intervals
  * Forecasting
  * Trend lines
  * Root cause analysis

### Q3 2024 objectives

1.  Rock-solid analytics (<TeamMember name="Thomas Obermüller" /> + <TeamMember name="Julian Bez" /> + <TeamMember name="Sandy Spicer" /> + <TeamMember name="Anirudh Pillai" />)
    
    1.  Legacy Minus – removing legacy insights code so that we can move fast
        -  FilterType gone from the frontend.
        -  rm -rf posthog/queries/
        -  All the flags from HogQL/querying work.
    2.  Tests Plus – shipping fewer bugs in the first place
        -  Ensure we test with the feature flags that users actually experience, both in end-to-end and integration tests.
        -  When shipping changes to queries, replay old vs. new version on thousands of real queries to check for regressions.
    3.  Metrics Plus – catching issues before before users report
        -  Analytics performance dashboard in Grafana (query duration, failures, etc.). Paging alerts on critical metrics, e.g. if the number of queries drops rapidly, or failures rise.
        -  Analytics experience dashboard in PostHog (time till data available, result freshness across insights and subscriptions, refreshes initiated manually vs. automatically, etc.)
        -  Alerts on major Product Analytics errors from Sentry, and us acting on every alert. (Bonus: checking up the Sentry routing rules for the #product-analytics team.)
        -  Cohorts dashboard in Grafana (successful vs. failed calculations per day, recalculation backlog). Alerts here too.
    4.  Support Plus – sparking joy for users when they’re led to report a bug
        -  1 hero + 1 sidekick
        -  Goal: 90% of tickets fulfill the SLA
2.  Answering more product questions, deeper (<TeamMember name="Thomas Obermüller" /> + <TeamMember name="Julian Bez" /> + <TeamMember name="Sandy Spicer" /> + <TeamMember name="Anirudh Pillai" />)
    1.  Run growth reviews with our product manager to get a grip on how Product Analytics is doing commercially, also dogfooding in the process. Use the learnings from both analysis and dogfooding to improve the product.
    2.  Build new features to empower users in answering product questions and digging into data, using the [list of requested features](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:team/product-analytics+sort:reactions-+1-desc) as inspiration:
        -  Analytics alerts are out to users (implemented with the contributor)
        -  “Done for the first time” in Trends, to kill the janky First Time Event Plugin
        -  Optional funnel steps
        - ...and more, to be prioritized based on user feedback
3.  ArtificialHog (<TeamMember name="Michael Matloka" /> + <TeamMember name="Georgiy Tarasov" />) – an LLM-based chat-like interface for answering product questions.

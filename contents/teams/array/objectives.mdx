## Q1 2026 goals

### Sense of winning / losing
**Winning feels like:** Array has real external users giving fast feedback, the core loop is obviously valuable, and reliability is no longer a blocker to feedback. We're shipping quickly on top of stable infra.
**Losing feels like:** we're still "getting ready to launch", feedback is mostly internal/opinion-based, and instability is causing internal users to churn.

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Get Array into external users hands and get real feedback
**Owner:** Peter
**Motivation:** Without real external usage, we can't validate priorities. Everything else becomes speculative.

**What we'll ship:**
- An invite-only external beta, looking to see market pull with people asking to be added
- A fully instrumented dmg so we can track usage and product metrics

---

### Objective 2: Make Array positioning and value obvious in the first session
**Owner:** Jonathan
**Motivation:** Users don't understand why they'd use Array yet. We need a clear value prop and onboarding that leads to the first moment-of-magic.

**What we'll ship:**
- Seamless onboarding that gets users to a working PR in the first session
- A great UX to use parallel agents in both cloud and local execution modes
- Have PostHog generated signals create tasks in Array

---

### Objective 3: Make Array reliable and stable
**Owner:** Charles
**Motivation:** Stability problems destroy trust and poison feedback. Reliability is prerequisite to learning.

**What we'll ship:**
- Improved reliability of the Array product
- Continuous delivery of the Array updates so users are always running the latest version
- Lightweight testing strategy focused on key services

---

### Objective 4: AI Infra to support Array and future products
**Owner:** Josh
**Motivation:** Building agents is hard, if we can solve these problems ourselves can can ship more products in the future to help others with this problem.

**What we'll ship:**
- LLM Gateway service for model routing and LLMA integration
- Sandbox environment for agent execution that is seamlessly parsed between cloud and local execution

---

## Anti-goals (explicitly out of scope for Q1)
- Broad public launch
- Heavy E2E testing

  <summary>Awesome content and docs for data warehouse</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" /> (support from <TeamMember name="Vincent Ge" /> and <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" />)

**Motivation:** Data warehouse is a high-leverage product for our customer infrastructure strategy, but it lacks both high-quality docs and strong content marketing content to drive adoption. 

**What we'll ship:**
* Updated and fully fleshed out docs, working along similar lines to reference docs Edwin and Vincent are creating for error tracking.  
* Alternatives, comparison and top-of-funnel content promoting our data warehouse.  
* Opinionated blog and newsletter content (e.g. how we use data warehouse)

**We'll know we're successful when**

* Top-of-funnel content is getting traction and creating interest  
* Interest in the product converts to real usage from new and existing users  
* Growth in pageviews to data warehouse docs and tutorials  
* Increased visibility of PostHog as a data warehouse option from LLMs

**What we'll ship**

  <summary>Generated SDK reference docs for popular SDKs</summary>

  * posthog-react-native  
  * posthog-node

  * We want push for highly accurate coverage and accuracy for these  
* `posthog.com` page that reads references and displays reference docs for:  
  * Exposed methods  
  * Parameter input and return type output  
  * Type definitions

**We'll know we're successful when**
* We gravitate toward checking SDK references as a source of truth for SDK signatures.  
* No more huge, hand-written SDK docs pages  
* 0 undocumented methods and type definitions for listed SDKs

## Other

  <summary>Sidequests</summary>

* Plan for dealing with stalke tutorials and content – Lior
* Testing viral animated video shorts – Lior  
* Automating summaries of the docs feedback each week with LLMs to make it actionable – Vincent

<details>
  <summary>Things we want to do with new hires</summary>

* Much better docs + content marketing for CDP, surveys, and LLM observability
* Doubling down on SEO content (i.e. alternatives, comparisons, etc. for all products)
* Consistent video schedule for things like changelog, new features etc. outside of big projects 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Anti-goals</summary>

* **Nailing YouTube.** This is long-term ambition, but we're not ready to tackle this yet.  
* **Weekly newsletter.** We've been down this road several times. Requires more resources.  
* **Redesigning docs website.** [We have thoughts here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/11934), but we can't ship this alone and there are more hair on fire problems for us to solve.   
* **Great docs homepage experience.** We think this could be critical to communicating the customer infrastructure experience, but we have more fundamental problems to solve right now, and it isn't something we can ship alone. This is something we'll revisit as a potential Q4 goal / project.  
* **In-depth docs for Max AI.** Some improvement here would be nice and useful, but the product is moving too fast for us to usefully contribute and we think users will gain more from playing with Max AI than reading docs. We do, however, want to use HogToks to encourage and inspire users to try using Max and explore things you can do using AI in PostHog.  
* **Owning unanswered questions on Docs.** We don't have the capacity to do this and it would distract us from core goals. Will discuss better logic on docs pages for stale questions, or potentially out of date questions, with website folks.

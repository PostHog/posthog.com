# Q3 2025 content team goals

## Content & newsletter goals

<details>
  <summary>Content marketing for data warehouse</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" /> (support from <TeamMember name="Vincent Ge" /> and <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" />)

**Motivation:** Data warehouse is a high-leverage product for our customer infrastructure strategy, but it lacks both high-quality docs and strong content marketing content to drive adoption. 

**What we'll ship:**
* Updated and fully fleshed out docs, working along similar lines to reference docs Edwin and Vincent are creating for error tracking.  
* Alternatives, comparison and top-of-funnel content promoting our data warehouse.  
* Opinionated blog and newsletter content (e.g. how we use data warehouse)

**We'll know we're successful when**

* Top-of-funnel content is getting traction and creating interest  
* Interest in the product converts to real usage from new and existing users  
* Growth in pageviews to data warehouse docs and tutorials  
* Increased visibility of PostHog as a data warehouse option from LLMs

  <summary>Maturing the newsletter growth engine</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Lior Neu-ner" />

  <summary>Long-term vision for newsletters</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" />, <TeamMember name="Lior Neu-ner" />, and <TeamMember name="Andy Vandervell" />

**Motivation:** We want to maintain our existing newsletter schedule and quality standards while developing a stronger opinion on the future of newsletters at PostHog, audiences we want to reach, and what we're going to do to reach them in the short, medium and long-term.

**What we'll ship:**
* An awesome newsletter every two weeks
* Newsletter offsite to workshop new ideas and long-term plans
* Updated handbook pages on newsletter process + plans

**We'll know we're successful when**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Shipping product engineer handbook</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Andy Vandervell" />

**Motivation:** We want to completely own the concept of the Product Engineer by creating its central text. We're 80% of the way there. Need to ship final 20%.

**What we'll ship**
* The introductory chapters of the handbook using a similar structure to the company handbook. This will give us the platform to then develop more sections on specific topics, or potentially integrate getting started content into the handbook.

* Positive initial reaction from our users and readers

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Better systems and insights for content marketing</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Andy Vandervell" />

**Motivation:** We want a better grasp of data and growth patterns for our work, and we (mostly Andy, tbh) thinks more robust systems will help us coordinate content and marketing efforts better as we scale.

**What we'll ship**
* Insight of the week during sprint meetings  
* Kick-ass new dashboards for how content and docs are performing  
* Monthly growth review for team content (inc. newsletter, content & docs)

## Docs goals

<details>
  <summary>Create the ideal product docs for error tracking</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Vincent Ge" /> and <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" /> (support from <TeamMember name="Ian Vanagas" />)

**Motivation:** We want to show what 10x docs should look like by setting an example with a single product. These conventions will become examples and templates for 10x-ing other docs and a model for future technical writers to follow.

**What we'll ship:**
* End-to-end product docs which include overview, concept explainers, references, use-case guides, tutorials, best practices, troubleshooting, code examples.  
* Stretch goal: Example app for error tracking

**We'll know we're successful when:**
* Other small teams want their docs to look like the error tracking docs :)  
* Praise from users how awesome error tracking docs are
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Generated SDK reference docs for popular SDKs</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Vincent Ge" /> 

**Motivation:** No one should guess or look at source code to know how SDK methods work. We need to auto-generate references from source code that are accurate and always up to date.

**What we'll ship**
* Reference generation code for:  
  * posthog-js  
  * posthog-react-native  
  * posthog-node  
  * posthog (python)  
  * We can ship more or less depending on schedule/ask  
  * We want push for highly accurate coverage and accuracy for these  
* `posthog.com` page that reads references and displays reference docs for:  
  * Exposed methods  
  * Parameter input and return type output  
  * Type definitions

**We'll know we're successful when**
* We gravitate toward checking SDK references as a source of truth for SDK signatures.  
* No more huge, hand-written SDK docs pages  
* 0 undocumented methods and type definitions for listed SDKs
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10x-ing docs contributors**</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" />

**Motivation:** At PostHog, everybody writes documentation. So let's equip everyone with the templates, tools, and criteria to 10x their output alongside ours.

**What we'll ship**
* An updated docs handbook with templates, tools, and style guide criteria for writing PostHog documentation  
* A set of LLM prompts to help quickly generate templates

**We'll know we're successful when**
* Teams actively use the templates and tools to write new docs  
* Positive feedback from teams that resources make it easier for them to ship docs
</details>

## Video goals

<details>
  <summary>Ship big and awesome video projects</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Alex van Leeuwen" />

**Motivation:** We have a series of ongoing video projects that are high-value and big lifts

</details>

<details>
  <summary>HogTok</summary> 

**Owner: <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" /> (with support from video)**

**What we'll ship**
* Two HogTok's per week consistently  
* Social media player that supports videos and images in the app and website  
* Social posts on brand and James' account using HogToks

**We'll know we're successful when**

* Support and sales teams find it useful enough to share with users  
* We can see conversion to usage / adoption of features
</details>

## Meta goals

<details>
  <summary>We hire all the awesome people</summary>

**Owner:** Andy

**Motivation:** We need to grow our team to increase our capacity for core work and grow our owned audiences

**What we'll ship:**
* Hire all Q3 roles in the marketing hiring place:
  * 1x post-production specialist
  * 1x content marketer
  * 1x developer who writes guides
  * 1x Developer who writes newsletters
* Proposals for new roles as needed, including:
  * Developer who is terminally online (social media)

**We'll know we're successful when**
* We've hired everyone want during Q3
* New starters onboarded and making an instant positive impact
</details>

## **Sidequests:** 
* Working with freelance agency to update stale tutorials – Lior
* Viral animated video shorts – Lior  
* Automating summaries of the docs feedback each week with LLMs to make it actionable – Vincent  
* Adding Greptile or similar to website repo to spot common errors and problems – Ian

## **Things we want to do with new hires:**

* Much better docs + content marketing for CDP, surveys, and LLM observability
* Doubling down on SEO content (i.e. alternatives, comparisons, etc. for all products)
* Consistent video schedule for things like changelog, new features etc. outside of big projects 

## **Anti-goals:**

* **Nailing YouTube.** This is long-term ambition, but we're not ready to tackle this yet.  
* **Weekly newsletter.** We've been down this road several times. Requires more resources.  
* **Redesigning docs website.** [We have thoughts here](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/11934), but we can't ship this alone and there are more hair on fire problems for us to solve.   
* **Great docs homepage experience.** We think this could be critical to communicating the customer infrastructure experience, but we have more fundamental problems to solve right now, and it isn't something we can ship alone. This is something we'll revisit as a potential Q4 goal / project.  
* **In-depth docs for Max AI.** Some improvement here would be nice and useful, but the product is moving too fast for us to usefully contribute and we think users will gain more from playing with Max AI than reading docs. We do, however, want to use HogToks to encourage and inspire users to try using Max and explore things you can do using AI in PostHog.  
* **Owning unanswered questions on Docs.** We don't have the capacity to do this and it would distract us from core goals. Will discuss better logic on docs pages for stale questions, or potentially out of date questions, with website folks.

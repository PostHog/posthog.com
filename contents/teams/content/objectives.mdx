  <summary>2x-ing product comparisons</summary>

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** We want to make product comparisons consistent, up to date, and aligned with our positioning as a developer tool, so they become a reliable entry point for SEO and LLM visibility.

**What we'll ship:**

* Audit and refresh most popular comparisons to ensure accuracy, consistency, developer-first positioning, LLM readability, etc. Experiment with AI-assisted content (Airops) to improve and speed up this workflow.
* Ship missing error tracking comparisons against key competitors

**We'll know we're successful when:**

* Every major competitor has a dedicated, up-to-date comparison article.  
* Comparisons consistently reflect our positioning as a dev tool  
* LLM outputs reflect accurate, up-to-date info in comparison queries.  
* We see steady growth in visibility from both traditional search and LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Sharpening our AEO strategy</summary>

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** We want to ensure PostHog is represented accurately and prominently in LLM outputs by tracking prompts, monitoring citations, and running experiments to see how optimized and new content can influence the answers these models generate.

**What we'll ship**

* Roll out an AEO tracking tool to monitor prompts and citations at both a general and per-product level.  
* Run a Q4 “blitz” on error tracking as treatment vs control to measure AEO impact before scaling.  
  * Create and/or optimize content specifically for LLMs   
  * Pilot YouTube as an AEO lever via prescriptive creator briefs

**We'll know we're successful when**

* We have end-to-end visibility on how PostHog shows up in LLMs across products  
* Key competitor and product prompts consistently surface PostHog in accurate, positive ways and echo our developer tool positioning  
* We can measure the impact of AEO efforts and expand proven tactics across product lines.

  <summary>Better reporting on content performance</summary>

**Owner:** Natalia Amorim

**Motivation:** Right now, performance data is scattered and often looked at in isolation. We want to introduce a structured monthly content performance review to give the team clearer visibility across products, spot trends, and use those insights to guide planning, prioritization, and decision-making.

**What we'll ship**

* A recurring monthly content review  
* Dashboards and supporting materials

**We'll know we're successful when**

* The team has clear visibility into how content is performing at both an overall and per-product level.  
* Everyone can access and understand key metrics without needing to dig.  
* Insights from reviews consistently shape our content planning and prioritization.

  <summary>Newsletter</summary>

**Owner:** Ian Vanagas

**Motivation:** We've scaled back our paid acquisition with the newsletter, so we're going to migrate to Beehiiv. We'll grow more through better integration and analytics. This will also help us tie the newsletter closer to the "marketing funnel".

**What we'll ship:**

- A great newsletter every two weeks  
- Audit of subscriber list to remove inactive subs  
- Migrate to Beehiiv and set up better onboarding flow, analytics, referrals, better integrated in posthog.com and other nice features

**We'll know we're successful when:**

- Newsletter is growing faster than when we left Substack  
- Newsletters getting more views each time

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Better high-level messaging</summary>

**Owner:** Ian Vanagas

**Motivation:** We’ve had a lot of changes in terms of positioning of the company lately and that has left a scattering of messaging across our site, content, and how we talk about ourselves. 

**What we'll ship:**

- A marketing handbook page with key messaging, such as  
  - What is PostHog?  
  - What are the benefits of using PostHog?  
  - Why use PostHog over other options?  
- Update pages that talk about these things to be consistent  
- A statement we can use everywhere

**We'll know we're successful when:**

- Our own team and content is using this messaging more  
- We hear that messaging back from users  
- People on social media use this messaging, instead of "product analytics"

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Ship the product engineer handbook this time</summary>

**Owner:** Andy

**Motivation:** We want to completely own the concept of the Product Engineer by creating its central text. We're 80% of the way there. Need to ship final 20%.

**What we'll ship:** 

* Intro chapters of the handbook using a similar structure to the company handbook.

**We'll know we're successful when**

* We've shipped the first version of the guide  
* Positive initial reaction from our users and readers  
* Ranking for product engineer keywords in search  
* Incoming users convert to reading other parts of guide  
* Converting handbook readers to subscribers of the newsletter

</details>

## Docs

<details>
  <summary>Even better SDK reference docs</summary>

**Owner:** Vincent Ge

**Motivation:** We’ve got all the infrastructure to keep shipping SDK references. Now we want them to be versioned, updated automatically on push to master, and hosted in each SDK’s repo.

**What we'll ship**

* References for Flutter, Android, iOS, GoLang. (still by popularity)  
* CI workflows + website code to automatically keep references up to date.  
* Selectors to view references by version. This is important for teams that choose to remain on older SDK versions.

**We'll know we're successful when**

* THE definitive source of truth for human and LLM readers for popular SDKs.  
* Versioned references published when new SDK versions are released, without any human in-the-loop.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Usable API reference docs</summary>

**Owner:** Vincent Ge

**Motivation:** LLM based tools need these. Companies that want to deeply integrate with PostHog as a developer tool will need these. Doesn't need to be pretty, but information must be accurate.

**What we'll ship:** 

* Investigate how we generate SDK specs right now  
* Examine past feedback about APIs  
* Ship code and copy updates to correct *only* the parts that are wrong  
* Make the website API references page slightly prettier

**We'll know we're successful when**

* A developer or LLM can use the API docs without being mislead.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Next-generation installation instructions</summary>

**Owner:** Vincent Ge

**Motivation:** We now own onboarding, wizard, and docs. They have a few problems:

* They’re inconsistent. The information should be generally the exact same. You should be able to start in onboarding, move to docs, and then to wizard and see the same general instructions/approach. This builds trust and makes installation easier to follow.  
* They’re hard to maintain. We have 3 copies of the same information.  
* They lack clear checkpoints. No self-checking mechanisms that help readers/LLMs understand if they’re succeeding.

**What we'll ship**

* A standardized set of “instructions” for humans and machines. Similar to GitHub Spec-Kit, but less general. [See RFC](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/pull/362)  
* A way to define clear checkpoints for humans and LLMs to follow. Including APIs and MCP tools if necessary.  
* Website, monorepo, and wizard updates where applicable to consume this.

**We'll know we're successful when**

* A single source to update for instructions.  
* LLMs and humans aren’t lost when they implement PostHog in their apps.  
* Technical writing teams are jealous we built this first.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Next-generation wizard</summary>

**Owner:** Danilo Campos

**Motivation**: The wizard’s architecture is a dead-end. It’s too hard to maintain, and it can’t support more ambitious integrations in its current form. The code, prompts and context to support integrations are tightly coupled, making maintenance expensive. Error correction is non-existent, so our success comes down to luck. While that luck is overall good, with 80% or more wizard runs happy and healthy, there’s still thousands of people who end up with a bad outcome.

**What we'll ship**

* A wrapped Claude Code SDK CLI tool that uses our MCP for prompting and context provisioning, able to error correct its output in realtime.  
* Fully-runnable example project code per framework

**We'll know we're successful when**:

* Users can’t believe how deep yet CORRECT our auto-integration is  
* Feedback about poor integration experiences decreases dramatically  
* We can easily support additional product integrations by adding high-level prompts and docs resources

<details>
  <summary>Make the error tracking docs even better</summary>

**Owner:** Edwin Lim

**Motivation**: I know I know. I think it’s worth investing a bit more time into raising the product docs bar from "very good" to "holy shit". I don’t think we’re far away now that we’ve built the *foundation* (Hari Seldon would be proud). We won’t get the chance to do this with other products, at least not for a long while. A lot of this work can be reused for other Q4 projects. 

**What we’ll ship:** 

* Flagship use-case guides, example app, more docs components, robust troubleshooting, cross-product tutorials, deep-dive blog post, etc.

**We'll know we're successful when**:

* Other product teams want their docs to look like error tracking docs  
* Users mention how good the error tracking docs are

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Docs Markdown service</summary>

**Owner:** Edwin Lim

**Motivation**: AI agents need high-quality, focused context on demand in order to do all their work. LLMS.txt is actually an amazing dev tool instead of a AEO tool. Let’s turn all our docs into a context service. 

**What we’ll ship:** 

* Utility scripts or workflows that creates a versioned directory of our docs for download  
* Multiple versions for different tokenized use cases (e.g., prose vs. just code snippets)

**We'll know we're successful when**:

* Agents like the Wizard or Claude Code perform better by using this context service

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Example apps library + AI commandments</summary>  

**Owner:** Edwin Lim, Danilo Campos

**Motivation**: We need example apps. Even before the AI agent craze, our platform is starved for runnable applications with PostHog integrations that developers can learn from. Now AI agents need example apps for context. 

**What we'll ship:** 

* Example apps in multiple frameworks that are annotated with code comments   
* Markdown file writeups that detail the application’s architecture, use cases,  and implementation for LLMs and humans to learn from  
* End-to-end tests that verify the code is running even when PostHog SDKs update  
* A maintained list of AI commandments: prompts with curated instructions for each example app that the agent can follow for best practices   
* A docs component that quotes code snippets from the example apps, replacing ad-hoc code examples in the docs

**We'll know we're successful when**:

* Agents are performing better when using these example apps as context  
* We're using the code   
* Users mention how good the error tracking docs are

</details>

<details>
<summary>Docs for new products and launches</summary> 

**Owner:** Edwin Lim, Vincent Ge

**Motivation**: We're shipping new, flagship products this quarter – especially developer and AI-focused ones like Array, logs, and Max AI with deep research. Marketing team also has upcoming product launches. These all need high-quality docs to go well.

**What we'll ship:** 

* MVP set of docs for each new product; overview, getting started, concepts, guides, AI, and resources, etc.
* Potentially ship a new AI docs section to unify our collection of AI dev tools like Max AI, Array, Wizard, MCP, and more

**We'll know we're successful when**:

* Users adopt new products without friction
* Positive feedback from users during and after each product launch
* PostHog is better positioned as platform for dev tools and AI

  <summary>Get to a healthier release cadence</summary>

**Owner:** Alex van Leeuwen & Jordan Dibb

**Motivation:** Current film release efforts have been ad hoc & irregular. To best build traction and have a more consistent structure to our efforts, we want to have some regularity to when we ship.
What we’ll ship: Enough assets to have a weekly release cadence for a period of at least 2 months. This release window will encompass things already in the edit (Hackathon); changelogs; and new content that we aim to film as much as possible in a single shooting block, that then get edited & released.

**What we'll ship:**

* Enough assets to have a weekly release cadence for a period of at least 2 months. This release window will encompass things already in the edit (Hackathon); changelogs; and new content that we aim to film as much as possible in a single shooting block, that then get edited & released.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

- We see growing engagement + channel subs with videos as we release more frequently
- We hit our release deadlines.
- If we miss our release deadlines, we can diagnose what needs to change to unblock this.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Test a variety of different formats</summary>

**Owner:** Alex van Leeuwen & Jordan Dibb

**Motivation:** Shoot & release various types of film, to see which resonate most internally and externally.

**What we’ll ship:** A mixture of one off content (e.g. the hackathon documentary episodes & then full release; Ship It); fun, branded content (State of the Hog & other YouTube-centric ideas to come); changelogs; educational content; video(s) around a single launch.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

- We see which of these formats work and which don’t - and can identify why.
- Positive feedback from community and word of mouth about our cool videos.
- Foundational pieces to take into planning our video efforts for 2026.

<details>
  <summary>Nail launch video production</summary>

**Owner:** Alex

**Motivation:** We need to be able to produce high-quality launch videos consistently within the launch window of major new products. We want to come up with a formula for how we do these.

**What we'll ship:**

* At least one launch video that will act as a template that we can iterate on for future product launch videos.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* We have a high-quality format that we can produce at short notice. 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Changelog videos</summary>

**Owner:** Jordo

**Motivation:** Changelog is a core brand asset that we can use in lots of places. We want to push these out regularly while maintaining a high standard way above what most companies do.

**What we'll ship:**

* Changelog videos every two weeks  
* Distribution on all main social channels  
* Figure out email, website, in-app distribution for changelog vids

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* We can ship every two weeks without disrupting other video projects  
* Consistent engagement on social channels (X, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube)  
* Positive feedback from product teams and customers

</details>

<details>
  <summary>New demo videos</summary>

**Owner:** Ian and Jordo

**Motivation:** Our existing demo video is completely out of date, but our most popular video. We need a new one.

**What we'll ship:** 

* Introductory platform demo video that explains why you should use PostHog
* Product-specific “modules" we can use in docs, product pages, etc.  
* Intro video \+ modules combined into one video  
* An archived (video, script) that will make updating the demo video in the future easier.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* The combined videos we publish get more combined views than the existing demo video.  
* Sales feedback that the demo video is helpful

  <summary>Hire more awesome people for the content team</summary>

**Owner:** Andy

**Motivation:** We want to do lots of things and we need more people to do them

**What we'll ship:** 

* 2x Docs and tutorial writers   
* 1x newsletter contributor / technical marketer
* A YouTuber  
* Coach talent partner so they can own screening

**We'll know we're successful when**

* Andy spends less time screening initial candidates  
* We've hired the people we need

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Anti-goals</summary>

* Digital PR (both on the community side with Reddit and GitHub, and on the PR outreach side for publications); it's something that could help us move the needle with LLMs, but not a priority in the short or medium term.  
* Multimedia product comparisons. Could be a strategic advantage, not something we have capacity to take on right now  
* Figuring out long term newsletter strategy  
* Writing all product docs for all product teams. It’s not practical or efficient, we do better if we help with planning, reviewing, and organizing new docs instead.
* Overhauling platform docs right now – this a long term goal that our current goals feed into.

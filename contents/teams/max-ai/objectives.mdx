1. Deep research

    - Report planning, and re-planning
    - PostHog data access using sub-agents: query creation, session summarization
    - Web search
    - Output in the form of notebooks

    Goal: At least a few PostHog users who can't stop using Max Deep Research. A set of real-world-like evaluation cases, passing. Research mode released at a higher price point.

2. Session summaries
    
    Learnings extracted by an LLM's ability to analyze hundreds of session recordings, including the associated event data:
    - Max tool (usable by Deep Research)
    - Session summaries scene UX
    - Data from more products included

    Goal: Dozens of retaining active users of session summaries.

    - Universal search ‚Äì allow Max to search user-created resources as well, such as insight, feature flags, or experiments
    - Perform insight and cohort search in query creation
    - "Create dashboard" tool
    - Smooth flow of adding insights to dashboards with Max
    - Prefill memory with web search without interrupting user
    - Expand existing suites of curated evals
    - Help the LLM analytics team ship valuable automated evals on prod data

    Goal: All the above features shipped. A query quality improvement every week.

4. Max ü§ù other products

    Last but not least, we're here to help other teams easily ship valuable, Max-integrated AI features:

💡 Product Pulse (proactive data signals / suggestions)

### Open product questions

Pricing structure, then work with deep research & session summaries on concrete pricing
Provide suggestions on some UI/UX bits, that will also help with pricing / tool differentiation
Then: Figure out line between Max and Array if not clear yet
Then: Figure out MCP vs Max, if not clear yet
Then: Jobs to be done, if not clear yet

Where is the line between Max and Array, what is the handover, is Max read, and Array write?
Is everything ‘write’ Array? Such as creating a feature flag
What jobs to be done are we solving? How do we define business / product autonomy exactly?
Sit down with users to clarify product autonomy
MCP vs Max, where do they overlap, where not? Venn diagram style

Max AI lets you use PostHog's products through a chat interface.

## Working with other small teams:

Creating AI products involves specialist knowledge, a bit like infrastructure.

Our other small teams will always want to make their products work well with Max's interface.

To do this, we start engineers out in the Max team. They will ship whatever the current roadmap is.

When other teams need help, for example:

* the warehouse team wants to build natural language -> SQL
* the product analytics team wants to build natural language -> insights
* the session replay team wants to build natural language -> find relevant recordings

Then the Max team will send one of their engineers out to the other small team for one or several sprints, pairing with someone on the other team.

This naturally distributes AI knowledge through the organization _and_ means the AI features we ship are high quality and fit with our platform properly.

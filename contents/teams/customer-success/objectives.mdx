## Q1 2026 Goals

- Hit CSM Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 120% (CSMs)
- Hit and track all team revenue goals (Dana)

This quarter we're focused on evolving from a generally helpful human to a _strategic_ human for our customers – through deeper industry expertise, smarter internal and external signals, and more proactive engagement.

### Ship 3 industry playbooks that the CS team uses for customer engagements <TeamMember name="Kaya Thomas" photo />
We have customers across a lot of industries, each with their own set of business goals, metrics they care about, tech stack, typical personas, etc. We don't yet know the patterns of success for each specific industry.

Let's create industry-specific guidance with concrete, resuable patterns the team can use. Some questions:
- What specific recommendations can we try for customers in vertical X so they get more value from PostHog?
- What should customers be thinking of in terms of their analytics, PostHog implementation, workflows, etc. in order to build successful products?
- What specific business metrics can we help customers drive forward through their use of PostHog?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we can confidently answer "what are your other customers like us doing for X? (i.e. conversion, churn, retention, growth)"

### Do more workshops <TeamMember name="Ben Smith" photo />
Workshops are one of our best tools to demonstrate strategic value. Let's be more proactive in offering these to customers. We also want to answer:
- What are the broad types of workshop a customer will find valuable?
- What type of customer would benefit from what workshop – e.g. industry, level of PostHog implementation, business goal, time of year? At what point in their PostHog journey would they benefit from each workshop?
- Is there a template the team can re-use as a starting point to deliver their workshop?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we each run 15+ workshops in the quarter

### Explore segmentation / specialization <TeamMember name="Dana Zou" photo />
We each have customers across 10+ industries. Does specializing within the team lead to deeper expertise and relationships? What does specialized CS look like?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we have customers across 5 industries, not 10

### User friction signals <TeamMember name="Christophe Eynius Tranberg" photo />
Payment alone doesn't mean a customer is getting value. What early friction signs can we pick up on for product analytics? Can we be alerted on these signals in a timely and actionable manner?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we are aware of the friction points customers are encountering and reach out to individual users with tailored recommendations

### Account news alerts <TeamMember name="Steven Truong" photo />
We want to be aware of external signals – company news, new funding rounds, leadership changes, layoffs etc. We started this in our CS offsite hackathon but let's ship it into production this quarter. 

**We'll know we're successful when**: we make use of external activity to engage with customers

#### Early adoption signals using AI <TeamMember name="Marko Locher" photo />
We have lots of user behavior data, how can we use it to signal product adoption with less manual monitoring? Can we use AI to detect strong product intent (i.e. from exploring to actually adopting) and send this signal to Slack? Starting with error tracking - can we identify potential cross-sell opportunities in the early stages of error tracking usage and help customers reach full adoption?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we convert 5+ customers to active error tracking users who were identified through these early adoption signals

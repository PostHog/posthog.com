## Q1 2026 Goals

This quarter we're focused on becoming strategic humans to our customers, not just helpful support. That means deeper industry expertise, smarter signals about customer health, and more proactive engagement. We're building playbooks so we stop reinventing the wheel, exploring how to cluster our books so we can actually become experts, and shipping better alerting so we catch problems before they blow up.

We want to work on a strategic level with our customers – help their business succeed through making decisions using PostHog data. 

- Hit CSM Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 120% (CSMs)
- Hit and track all team revenue goals (Dana)

#### Ship 3 industry playbooks that the CS team uses for customer engagements (Kaya)
We work with customers across diverse industries, each with their own set of business goals, analytics needs, tech stack, metrics they care about, typical personas, etc. We don't yet know the patterns of success for each specific industry – making it difficult to help customers on a deep, strategic level, beyond general PostHog tips. 

We want to create industry-specific guidance with concrete, resuable patterns the team can use to get up to speed on a specific industry, answer "how are other similar customers being successful with PostHog?", and deliver higher-impact, strategic guidance.

Some examples:
- What's the typical approach to take with customers in vertical X?
- What should customers be thinking of in terms of their analytics, PostHog implementation, workflows, etc. in order to build successful products?
- What business impact and value can we help customers drive towards?

The goal is not just to publish more documentation, but to design these playbooks into the workflows CSMs already use so they become default tools.

#### Do more workshops (Ben)
Workshops are one of our best tools to demonstrate strategic value and we want to be more proactive in offering these of customers. Through experimenting with running more workshops, this goal is trying to answer:
- What are the broad types of workshop a customer will find valuable?
- What type of customer would benefit from what workshop – e.g. industry, level of PostHog implementation, business goal, time of year? At what point in their PostHog journey would they benefit from each workshop?
- Is there a template the team can re-use as a starting point to deliver their workshop?

#### Explore segmentation in CSM accounts (Dana)
Right now everyone has 30-40 customers across 10+ industries. This makes it difficult to build expertise in any specific industry.  We're exploring whether clustering books by vertical could help us build deeper expertise without massive disruption. This might mean new hires get more focused books, or gradual shifts over time.

#### Smarter internal alerts (Christophe)
We have a lot of alerts in Vitally – most require us to do more digging to understand the severity and relevancy of the alert as well as the action we should take. Often this means looking for information across five different places, which is time consuming and easily missed during busy weeks. How can we do this better? How can we be aware of specific user friction, changes in sentiment, low value realization etc – especially for customers that are quiet? The answer is _probably_ not more alerts. 

#### Account news alerts (Steven)
We want to be aware of external signals – company news, new funding rounds, leadership changes, layoffs etc. We started this in our CS offsite hackathon but let's ship it into production this quarter. 

#### Behavioral change monitoring (Marko)
How might we use AI to monitor customer behavior patterns and flag meaningful changes we might otherwise miss?

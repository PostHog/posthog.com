**Objective**: Build an awesome Customer Success team

## Q4 2025 Goals

  - Hit CSM Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 120% (CSMs)
  - Hit and track all team revenue goals (Dana)
    - Track more metrics: net logo retention, GDR, how much of NRR is contraction vs expansion

#### So many playbooks (part 2)
Create playbooks for the handbook on:
- Lifecycle of CSM's engagement with an account (Steven)
- Identifying engagement opportunities through customer audits (Kaya)
- Retro documentation on historical churn & exploration for prevention solutions (Steven)
- Improved new team member onboarding (Dana)

#### Opinionated product guides
Create guides on 'How to be a good product engineer with PostHog' (Christophe)
- Propose an opiniated approach to use PostHog to ship great products
- Experiment with different content types for maximum impact

#### Improved signals (Ben)
Account alerts in Vitally + Slack are powerful but too noisy right now, let's improve it
- Review and clean up existing alerts
- Add handbook guidance on responding to alerts
- Experiment with automated responses (eg. automatic chasing of failed payments)

#### Refine the Sales, Onboarding and CS pipeline
With the addition of the 'scale' CSM role covering accounts between $10K and $20K, the handover process between Sales, Onboarding and CS could be clearer. There's a risk that this may lead to overlap or gaps in ownership. I will:
- Review the current process(es) as documented in the handbook
- Where necessary, propose updated or clarified criteria for when accounts transition between Onboarding/Sales/CS ownership
- Update the handbook with new guidance as agreed with Onboarding and Sales

Demographic segmentation for our customers based on existing data (Tyler) - Segment, stage, industry, business model

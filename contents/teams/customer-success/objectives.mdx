## Q1 2026 Goals

- Hit CSM Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 120% (CSMs)
- Hit and track all team revenue goals (Dana)

This quarter we're focused on evolving from a generally helpful human to a _strategic_ human for our customers – through deeper industry expertise, smarter internal and external signals, and more proactive engagement.

### Ship 3 industry playbooks that the CS team uses for customer engagements (Kaya)
We have customers across a lot of industries, each with their own set of business goals, metrics they care about, tech stack, typical personas, etc. We don't yet know the patterns of success for each specific industry.

Let's create industry-specific guidance with concrete, resuable patterns the team can use. Some questions:
- What's the typical approach to take with customers in vertical X?
- What should customers be thinking of in terms of their analytics, PostHog implementation, workflows, etc. in order to build successful products?
- What business impact and value can we help customers drive towards?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we can confidently answer "what are your other customers like us doing for X"

### Do more workshops (Ben)
Workshops are one of our best tools to demonstrate strategic value. Let's be more proactive in offering these to customers. We also want to answer:
- What are the broad types of workshop a customer will find valuable?
- What type of customer would benefit from what workshop – e.g. industry, level of PostHog implementation, business goal, time of year? At what point in their PostHog journey would they benefit from each workshop?
- Is there a template the team can re-use as a starting point to deliver their workshop?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we each run 15+ workshops in the quarter

### Explore segmentation / specialization (Dana)
We each have customers across 10+ industries. Does specializing within the team lead to deeper expertise and relationships? What does specialized CS look like?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we have customers across 5 industries, not 10

### Smarter internal alerts (Christophe)
We have a lot of alerts in Vitally – most require digging to figure out the severity, relevancy, and required action. How can we do this better? The answer is _probably_ not more alerts. 

**We'll know we're successful when**: we start loving our alerts

### Account news alerts (Steven)
We want to be aware of external signals – company news, new funding rounds, leadership changes, layoffs etc. We started this in our CS offsite hackathon but let's ship it into production this quarter. 

**We'll know we're successful when**: we make use of external activity to engage with customers

#### Behavioral change monitoring (Marko)
How might we use AI to monitor customer behavior patterns and flag meaningful changes we might otherwise miss?

**We'll know we're successful when**: we're acting on meaningful changes that would've otherwise been missed

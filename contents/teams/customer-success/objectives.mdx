**Objective**: Build an awesome Customer Success team

## Q4 2025 Goals

  - Hit CSM Net Revenue Retention (NRR) of 120% (CSMs)
  - Hit and track all team revenue goals (Dana)
    - Track more metrics: net logo retention, GDR, how much of NRR is contraction vs expansion

#### So many playbooks (part 2)
Create playbooks for the handbook on:
- Lifecycle of CSM's engagement with an account (Steven)
- Identifying engagement opportunities through customer audits (Kaya)
- Retro historical churn reasons & exploration for potential solutions (Steven)
- Improved new team member onboarding (Dana)

#### Opinionated product guides
Create guides on 'How to be a good product engineer with PostHog' (Christophe)
- Propose an opiniated approach to use PostHog to ship great products
- Experiment with different content types for maximum impact

#### Improved signals (Ben)
Account alerts in Vitally + Slack are powerful but too noisy right now, let's improve it
- Review and clean up existing alerts
- Add handbook guidance on responding to alerts
- Experiment with automated responses (eg. automatic chasing of failed payments)

#### Refine the 'Scale CSM' role and the Onboarding --> Scale CSM --> CSM pipeline (Tom)
This new role sits somewhere between 'onboarding' and 'established CSM'. I'm going to: 
- Clarify the philosophy and goals of the Scale CSM role
- Add guideline criteria for customers which fit into the Scale CSM book of business
- Add guidance regarding 'Handover to Scale CSM' for the Onboarding team
- Add guidance to handbook around how to work with $10-20K accounts
- Think of a cool name that isn't 'Scale CSM'

Demographic segmentation for our customers based on existing data (Tyler) - Segment, stage, industry, business model

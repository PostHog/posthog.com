### Q1 2026 Objectives

#### Have happy paying customers
Motivation: Validate PMF - users want to pay for the service we provide, they aren’t just messing around with a free beta

* Billing integration
* GA Launch (finalise retention, pricing, start charging etc)
* PostHog integrations (session replay logs, PostHogJS integration)
* Platform Integrations (vercel, more generic api ingestions other than just otel)

#### Launch AI MVP feature
Generate buzz, set our product apart from everyone else,  *"We built a logging product where you don’t need to look at a log line ever again"*

* MVP Natural language log investigation, e.g. "Why did the capture service crash at 2pm on Tuesday?"

#### Make Logs part of PostHog

Logs is currently a very separate and isolated product and there’s a bunch of obvious integrations with other PostHog features, also makes a better case for *why PostHog for logs?*

* Logs links from error tracking
* Docs and easy default path for linking exception events to log resource
* Tie into product analytics (e.g. view logs for specific distinct_ids)
* Build logs panel into session replay view

## Starting up the video team

Because this team started in the middle of Q2, we're focusing on setting ourselves up for future success. This means:

1. Get equipment and figure out what we'll need to rent.
2. Create and document a basic process for ideation, organization, shooting, editing, feedback, and publishing.
3. Shoot and publish 5 types of videos.
4. Form opinions about what our video roadmap should look like. For now, we think fewer higher quality videos is best.

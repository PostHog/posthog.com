## Working together

The <SmallTeam slug="blitzscale" /> meets once a week to check in on immediate changes and unblock anything that needs to move fast. These meetings work best when the group stays lean, though sometimes we'll invite people outside the core team to contribute if they are working more closely on a specific area. This is particularly useful for deeper context or a new perspective on an ad-hoc basis.

A smaller meeting helps us move quickly and prevents us from overcollaborating. We've learnt that once the meeting gets too big, people become less likely to raise issues in their area and decision making slows down as a bigger group pushes for consensus instead of quick decisions.

To keep the group focused:
- Blitzscale should be a small team, just like any other team at PostHog. We aim to keep it to fewer than six people.
- As PostHog grows, we will add more director-level leaders but they will not necessarily join all meetings. If everyone joined the weekly meetings, the group will quickly become too large to be effective.
- We will review who is in the weekly meeting every three months and adjust as needed.
- Not being in the meeting does not mean your work is not important. It usually means you are doing a great job communication everthing the team might need to be aware about, so staying focused on your area is more important.

Notes will often be posted in [#team-blitzscale](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C06LMMS3YP4) later in the week.

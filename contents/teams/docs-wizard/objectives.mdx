## Missions for 2026

<details>
<summary>We’ve established the AI Wizard as the fastest way to activate PostHog</summary>

This means automatic integration for multiple products across multiple frameworks. This also means support for additional “skills” like migrations and troubleshooting. Ultimately, the Wizard closes the gap between curiosity and real usage. It delivers working PostHog solutions within a user’s codebase in minutes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>We’ve created platform docs that give us a competitive edge</summary>

This means positioning PostHog as a leading developer platform by showing how the entire product suite works together in practice. We’re creating deep, platform-level content like learning paths, cross-product guides, and interactive material for hands-on learning. Success means developers clearly understand PostHog’s strengths and advantages as a dev platform and ecosystem just by reading our docs.

<details>
<summary>We’ve built systems that make product docs mostly self-serve</summary>

This means each product engineering team writes and maintains their own product docs at a strong baseline level of quality by using the templates, tools, and processes we’ve put in place. We partner with teams to review, improve, or overhaul their docs when needed. Success means keeping current product docs updated and launching several new products with docs, without slowing down.

## Goals for Q1 2026 

<details>
<summary>Next milestones for the AI Wizard</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Danilo Campos" photo />

**Motivation:** People are ecstatic about the Wizard, but we can’t give the best version of it to people who aren’t running Next.js. We’ve made investments all along the infrastructure, now it’s a matter of building and plugging in the content, then testing it. It's time to ship the v2 Wizard with even more features to as many people as possible. 

**What we'll ship:** 
- Broader support for frameworks and languages: Next.js, React, Node, Python, and mobile platforms like React Native, iOS, and Android
- Expanded support for PostHog products like LLMA, feature flags, experiments, and surveys
- In-app actions, dashboard creation, and updates to projects via OAuth
- Updated CLI UX with a new onboarding flow and more flags and options
- New Wizard skills like migration, troubleshooting, and diagnostics
- Detection of 3rd party integrations (e.g. find Stripe integration and send data back to PostHog and then recommend CDP and data warehouse syncs)
- Improvements to internal DX and tools like examples repo, workbench, CI/CD, and testing

**We'll know we're successful when:** 
- User feedback maintains the high energy we expect
- Adding new frameworks, skills, or products to the Wizard is straightforward
- Other companies duplicate our approach
- Wizard installs and PostHog activations increase

<summary>Platform docs: Overhaul the getting started section</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Vincent Ge" photo /> <TeamMember name="Sarah Sanders" photo />

**Motivation:** The current [getting started section](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install) of our platform docs hasn't been meaningfully updated in months. More urgently, it does a bad job of getting users onboarded to the Posthog *platform*. It narrowly focuses on installs, methods like capture and identify, and reverse proxies, but even these concepts are poorly explained together. We need content that provides stronger guidance for core Posthog concepts and a clearer sequence for the cross-product, cross-framework steps a developer needs to take to get up and running.

**What we'll ship:** 
- A complete content overhaul of the current [Install and configure](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install) section 
- Information architecture changes to reorganize the sidebar and existing content
- An emphasis on the Wizard to demonstrate and guide PostHog onboarding

**We'll know we're successful when:** 
- It makes sense to read the platform getting started section *first*, before visiting individual product docs
- Developers are able to see meaningful data and insights in PostHog by following the new getting started section
- The Wizard is clearly positioned as the canonical, end-to-end onboarding path for the PostHog platform

<summary>Platform docs: AI education and jobs-to-be-done</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" photo />

**Motivation:** As hyped and exciting as the paradigm shift is, most developers are still learning the basics of what AI can do for them, their jobs, and their products. With an AI fleet that consists of the Wizard, PostHog AI, our MCP, LLMA, and Array, we are uniquely positioned to educate developers on how to apply AI to real use cases and jobs-to-be-done entirely within the PostHog ecosystem. Our platform docs can become an exemplary resource for AI usage and product building for engineers.

**What we'll ship:** 
- A new, strongly-opinionated section in the platform docs that primarily focuses on the use of AI and PostHog together
- Learning tracks that are organized by developer jobs-to-be-done and use cases that span multiple products
- Multi-product guides that heavily emphasize using AI tools like the Wizard, MCP, and PostHog AI to accelerate or automate

**We'll know we're successful when:** 
- Our customer-facing teams send these docs to prospects or users interested in PostHog
- Developers associate the PostHog platform with practical, end-to-end AI usage for building products 
- It spiritually connects with the Winning with PostHog and Getting HogPilled content

<summary>Revamp product installations and getting started content</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Sarah Sanders" photo />

**Motivation:** We have a new architecture for maintaining and rendering product installation content in our docs and in our app. But only LLMA is using it today. Migrating the other products will let us standardize installation content and directly feed the Wizard with the same Markdown source.

**What we'll ship:** 
- Move installation docs to new shared rendering architecture for product analytics, web analytics, session replay, feature flags, experiments, error tracking, data warehouse, and surveys
- Update examples repo to fetch the new installation docs for the Wizard to use as context
- Marginal improvements to the existing content or getting started sections

**We'll know we're successful when:** 
- Products have installation content in the new shared rendering architecture
- The Wizard is able to auto-implement the migrated products using the Markdown source as context
- The Wizard is able to auto-implement the migrated products in multiple languages
- Onboarding content becomes more consistent and maintainable and engineers are happy to update it

<summary>Improve docs for event setup like identify, session tracking, and properties</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Vincent Ge" photo />

**Motivation:** Some of our most important docs are the most confusing 🫠. Creating a clean, sensible PostHog setup is highly dependent on not screwing up basic setups like identification and cross-platform session tracking. These steps are crucial to make any sense of your PostHog data. We need to improve these docs to make sure developers can get up and running with PostHog effectively.

**What we'll ship:** 
- Improvements to identify, person properties, schema management, and other core event setup docs
- Update examples repo to fetch the new docs for the Wizard to use as context
- Information architecture changes to reorganize the sidebar for product analytics docs

**We'll know we're successful when:** 
- Developers are less confused by the core mechanics for PostHog event setup 
- The Wizard can use the new docs to auto-implement event setup

<details>
<summary>10x-ing docs contributors</summary>

**Owner:** <TeamMember name="Edwin Lim" photo /> <TeamMember name="Sarah Sanders" photo />

**Motivation:** Take three. We have like 6+ new products being launched or going GA in 2026. We're also increasing our headcount by 200+, most of which is engineering. Product docs need to be self-serve in order to scale. Full stop. It's critical that we get engineers and other teams contributing docs regularly by making the process clear and easy for them. The team alone probably can't ship 2x what we're doing now, but we as a company absolutely can.

**What we'll ship:** 
- The best team handbook in the company that details how we write product docs
- A collection of templates, resources, and runbooks to help product docs be self-serve
- Tooling to maintain docs like a prose linter, automated PR reviews, and screenshot validation

**We'll know we're successful when:** 
- New products are launched with a strongline baseline of docs
- Engineers have a clear understanding of how to write docs and loop in our team
- An early system for monitoring docs quality and consistency

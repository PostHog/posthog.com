## What this team does

We build PostHog's experimentation platform, allowing users run A/B tests and feature experiments easily in their apps. We help teams validate ideas, measure impact, and make informed decisions quickly and confidently.

Some of the things we're working on:
- Experiments UI – an interface for setting up, managing, and analyzing experiments in PostHog.
- Experimentation API – backend services that handle experiment creation, user assignment, and result analysis.
- Statistical analysis – implementing statistical methods to ensure accurate interpretation of results.
- Documentation – writing documentation and tutorials to help users get the most out of Experiments.

## What this team does

We build PostHog's experimentation platform, allowing users run A/B tests and feature experiments easily in their apps. We help teams validate ideas, measure impact, and make informed decisions quickly and confidently.

Some of the things we're working on:
- Experiments UI – an interface for setting up, managing, and analyzing experiments in PostHog.
- Experimentation API – backend services that handle experiment creation, user assignment, and result analysis.
- Statistical analysis – implementing statistical methods to ensure accurate interpretation of results.
- Documentation – writing documentation and tutorials to help users get the most out of Experiments.

## User personas

### Assessing customer fit
Use this guide to determine if a prospect's use case is a good fit for Experiments now, in the future, or at all.

### Engineers (product, growth, software, etc.)
**✅ Fully supported now**

They get the most value since they can run experiments end-to-end, which allows them to test ideas quickly without coordination overhead.

**Best fit:** Teams where engineers can run experiments directly.

---

### Product Managers
**✅ Fully supported now**

They use PostHog to decide what to test, monitor experiment results, and make data-driven decisions. While they typically need an engineer to implement the test, they can independently analyze results using our charts, statistical analysis, and AI summaries.

**Best fit:** PMs who work with engineers for implementation but want to independently analyze results.

---

### Data Scientists/Analysts
**⏳ Growing support → Full support planned (2026)**

**What works today:** Frequentist and bayesian analysis, delta charts, timeseries, funnel breakdowns

**Coming soon:** Advanced statistical methods (CUPED, variance reduction techniques, multilayer experiments) - planned for 2026

**Is this customer a fit?**
- ✅ Yes, if they need standard statistical analysis
- ⏳ Wait or set expectations if they require advanced methods like CUPED (coming 2026)

---

### Growth/Marketing teams
**⏳ Limited support → Full support planned (further out)**

**What works today:** Can run experiments on messaging, landing pages, campaigns - but require engineering help for implementation

**Coming later:** AI-powered visual editor will enable independent experiment setup without engineering (further out - requires mature code generation)

**Is this customer a fit?**
- ✅ Yes, if they have dedicated engineering resources
- ⏳ Wait if they need no-code/independent setup (AI editor coming but no firm timeline)

---

### Designers
**⏳ Limited support → Full support planned (further out)**

**What works today:** Can implement simple experiments (copy changes, styling updates) independently; need engineering for complex components

**Coming later:** AI-powered visual editor will enable more complex implementations (further out - requires mature code generation)

**Is this customer a fit?**
- ✅ Yes, if simple UI experiments or they have engineering support
- ⏳ Wait if they need to independently implement complex UI changes (AI editor coming but no firm timeline)

## What this team does

We build PostHog's experimentation platform, allowing users run A/B tests and feature experiments easily in their apps. We help teams validate ideas, measure impact, and make informed decisions quickly and confidently.

Some of the things we're working on:
- Experiments UI – an interface for setting up, managing, and analyzing experiments in PostHog.
- Experimentation API – backend services that handle experiment creation, user assignment, and result analysis.
- Statistical analysis – implementing statistical methods to ensure accurate interpretation of results.
- Documentation – writing documentation and tutorials to help users get the most out of Experiments.

## User personas

### Who we're building for

**Engineers (product, growth, software, etc.)**
They get the most value since they can run experiments end-to-end, which allows them to test ideas quickly without coordination overhead.

**Product Managers**
They use PostHog to decide what to test, monitor experiment results, and make data-driven decisions. While they typically need an engineer to implement the test, they can independently analyze results using our charts, statistical analysis, and AI summaries.

### Who we somewhat support

**Data Scientists/Analysts**
They can use our frequentist and bayesian analysis, view delta charts, timeseries, and funnel breakdowns. We're missing some advanced features like CUPED that the most sophisticated teams might need.

**Growth/Marketing teams**
They can run experiments on messaging, landing pages, and campaigns - but need engineering help to implement them. Unlike pure no-code tools, they can't set up tests independently.

**Designers**
They can implement simpler experiments themselves - copy changes, styling updates, basic UI variations. For complex components or application logic, they'll need engineering support.

### Note on no-code experiments
We have a no-code experiment editor in beta, but it has limited support and doesn't cover all use cases. We're working on AI-powered visual editing that will generate implementation code automatically, making experiments more accessible to non-engineers.

### Q1 2026 Objectives
This quarter we’re focused on making experiments faster, clearer, and easier to work with by improving performance and results loading, and fixing rough edges in how experiments work. We’re also expanding data and replay support, and starting to use AI to help teams come up with better experiments.

#### Query performance <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />
For large-scale users, experiment queries are timing out or taking many minutes to load. We will build a way to precompute the heavy parts of these queries on a schedule, so that the final computation runs in a reasonable amount of time. This will be enabled for select customers and be easily toggleable. The goal is to use high-scale customers as a testing ground, so we have this solution in place before we onboard more users at this scale.

#### Anonymous -> Logged in experiments: full support <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />
Last quarter, we implemented support for running reliable experiments across the anonymous-to-authenticated flow, currently available in posthog-js. This quarter, we will extend this support to all libraries and gather user feedback on usability and whether it works well for them in practice.

#### Experiment phases <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />
Currently, changing rollout conditions mid-experiment creates a poor experience, with confusing warnings and potentially invalid statistical analysis. We will introduce experiment phases: distinct periods within an experiment where rollout conditions stay the same. This makes it clear when and how an experiment changed over time, and makes the results easier to reason about.

#### Integrate session replay summaries <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />
PostHog now supports session replay summaries via chat. We will integrate replay summaries into experiments so they help explain and add context to the experiment results.

#### Extend data warehouse support <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />
We will extend data warehouse experiment support to funnels. We will also improve the overall experience by providing clear guidance on how to run data warehouse experiments, and we will two data warehouse experiments ourselves to build up hands-on knowledge within the team.

#### AI generated experiments <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />
We will help users come up with experiment ideas interactively via chat. We will use existing insights, recordings and "signals" as input, combine them with user-provided context. Then we will generate an experiment idea, set up the experiment with metrics, and recommend how to implement it in code.

#### Great results loading experience <TeamMember name="Marcel Poelker" photo />
We already precompute timeseries results. We will use these timeseries as the main experiment results, so users see freshly calculated results when they open the app, instead of having to refresh manually and wait.

#### Retire legacy experiments to a read-only mode <TeamMember name="Marcel Poelker" photo />
Legacy experiments take up a large part of our codebase. We will cleanly separate them and move them to a read-only mode: still visible for audit and reference, but no longer editable or recalculable. This will reduce support burden and simplify the codebase.

### Q4 2024 Objectives

This quarter, we're focusing on more feature improvements to help users create comprehensive and easy-to-analyze experiments. These improvements will make our product more mature and complete.

### Objective 1: Finish HogQL rewrite

We will migrate Experiments to HogQL, making result calculations more reliable and performant. This will also enable the addition of new features listed below.

### Objective 2: Multiple experiment goals supported + visualized

We will add support for multiple goal metrics in a single experiment, allowing them to be visualized together and making it easier to interpret results across all metrics simultaneously.

### Objective 3: Reusable experiment metrics

We will add the ability to create metric sets that users can save and reuse. This will reduce friction, improve maintainability, and decrease the likelihood of errors.

### Objective 4: Review and adjust methodology with a statistician

We will review our current methodology to ensure it is both accurate and easy for our users to understand.

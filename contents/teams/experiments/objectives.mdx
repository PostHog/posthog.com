### Q2 2025 Objectives

#### Objective 1: All new experiments use the new query engine
_Motivation_: The old query engine was difficult to extend and in some cases gave inconsistent results.
_What we will ship_:
* A more robust and accurate query engine
* A new calculator to estimate running time
* Enhanced visibility of experiment exposures and other health metrics

#### Objective 2: Add frequentist method + other requested features
_What we will ship_:
- Frequentist Analysis: Offer a frequentist alternative to our existing Bayesian approach, giving users more flexibility in how they interpret and act on experiment data.
- Data Warehouse Integration: Finalize data warehouse support, so users can analyze external data within the experimentation workflow.
- Winsorization: Implement optional outlier trimming (winsorizing) to handle extreme data points.
- Timeseries Deltas + Intervals: Provide timeseries visualization of deltas and credible (or confidence) intervals for clearer trend insights over time.
- Breakdowns: Allow users to break down experiment results on dimensions (i.e country, subscription plan, etc.)

#### Objective 3: Implement a fair and transparent pricing model
Motivation: Monetize the experimentation product in a way that is straightforward for customers.
_What we will ship_:
* A billing model that aligns cost with actual experiment usage and business value.

#### Objective 4: AI-Powered experimentation workflow
Motivation: Keep pace with broader company initiatives around AI and the industry in general.
_What we potentially could ship_:
* Automatically generated explanations or summaries of experiment results to guide decision-making and highlight key findings.

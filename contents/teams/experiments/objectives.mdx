### Q4 2025 Objectives

#### AI features
* **Integrate Experiments into Tasks (AI)** – Deploy any code change behind an experiment, track its progress, and make a decision based on results. <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />

* **“Analyze results”** AI agent – An AI agent that reviews experiment results, highlights important findings, and explains them in plain language. It can suggest whether to continue the test, stop it early, or roll out a variant. The agent should also call out risks, like low sample size or unusual data patterns, to help teams make better decisions. <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />

* ** AI assisted metric set up** – Provide a chat-based interface that helps users define and configure metrics for their experiments. The AI will suggest the right metric type ask clarifying questions about the user’s goals, and set up the metric. This reduces setup time and prevents common mistakes. <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />


#### Feature flags foundation
* **Anonymous -> Logged in users experiments** – Create a seamless experience for experiments that start with anonymous users but continue when the same user logs in. <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />

* **Feature flags integration** <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />
    - Sticky bucketing: guarantee that users always get the same experience once bucketed.  
    - More precise rollout conditions: support targeting by complex properties 

#### Metrics & results
* **Retention metric** – Add support for retention as a metric type, covering use cases like “users who return after 7 days”. This is the last major metric type missing from experiments. <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />

* **Metric breakdowns** – Enable users to break down experiment metrics by properties such as country, device, plan type, or any custom property. This allows deeper analysis of how variants perform across different user segments. <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />

* **Running time calculator** <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />
Build a new calculator with two functions:
    - Before launch: let users enter their expected traffic and baseline conversion to estimate how long the experiment will take to reach significance.  
    - During the experiment: show how much longer the experiment likely needs based on current progress and live data.

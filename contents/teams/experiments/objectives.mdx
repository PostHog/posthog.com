### Q3 2025 Objectives

#### Objective 1: Build advanced features  
Motivation: Continue closing the gap with more mature competitors.

What we will ship:
* **Results timeseries** – Show the historical progression of experiment results to give a clearer picture over time, not just a snapshot. <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />
* **Experiment layers** – Allow users to be split between different experiments to avoid overlap. <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />
* **Multi-armed bandits** – Automatically adjust rollout based on live data. <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />

#### Objective 2: Metrics + UX improvements  
Motivation: Make experiments easier to set up, monitor, and understand. Reduce friction to improve retention.

What we will ship:
* **Setup wizard** – a simpler way to set up experiments, possibly with MaxAI assistance <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />
* **Activity log** – Show who made changes to an experiment and when <TeamMember name="Rodrigo Iloro" photo />
* **Ratio metrics** – Enable metrics like "% of positive feedback" <TeamMember name="Anders Asheim Hennum" photo />
* **Exclusion step** for funnel experiments <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />

#### Objective 3: Awesome documentation <TeamMember name="Juraj Majerik" photo />
Motivation: Present ourselves as a mature and sophisticated product through excellent documentation.

What we will ship:
* A clear, intuitive structure that supports both statistical methods and both versions of the query engine  
* Detailed method explanations with examples  
* Commonly used scenario walkthroughs  
* AI-related content – Examples of how to run AI/prompt experiments

#### Objective 4: Clean code  
Motivation: Keep development fast and enjoyable.

What we will ship:
* Use the same UI for both Bayesian and Frequentist results  
* Break up `experimentLogic` into 5 - 8 smaller logics based on the single responsibility principle  
* Isolate utility functions and ensure they are well-tested

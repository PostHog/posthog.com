### Q2 2025 Objectives

#### Objective 1: All new experiments use the new query engine
Motivation: The old query engine was difficult to extend and in some cases gave inconsistent results.

What we will ship:
* A more robust and accurate query engine
* A new calculator to estimate running time
* Enhanced visibility of experiment exposures and other health metrics

#### Objective 2: Add frequentist method + other requested features
What we will ship:
- **Frequentist Analysis**: Offer a frequentist alternative to our existing Bayesian approach, giving users more flexibility in how they interpret and report on experiment data.
- **Data Warehouse Integration**: Finalize data warehouse support, so users can analyze external data within the experimentation workflow.
- **Winsorization**: Implement optional outlier trimming (winsorizing) to handle extreme data points.
- **Timeseries Deltas + Intervals**: Provide timeseries visualization of deltas and credible (or confidence) intervals for clearer trend insights over time.
- **Breakdowns**: Allow users to break down experiment results on dimensions (i.e country, subscription plan, etc.)

#### Objective 3: Implement a fair and transparent pricing model
Motivation: Monetize the experimentation product in a way that is straightforward for customers.

What we will ship:
* A billing model that aligns cost with actual experiment usage and business value.

#### Objective 4: AI-Powered experimentation workflow
Motivation: Keep pace with broader company initiatives around AI and the industry in general.

What we may ship:
* Automatically generated explanations or summaries of experiment results to guide decision-making and highlight key findings.

## Q4 2025 objectives

This quarter will last only 6 weeks, so we need to be very focused on what we can achieve.
After that time, we'll be changing focus to work on Growth.

- Launch GA Revenue Analytics Dashboard <TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo />
- Transform revenue analytics into a platform for other teams <TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo />
  - Turn Revenue Analytics'managed views into actual database-level views that can be materialized
  - These views lifecycle should be totally managed by ourselves including the auto-materialization
  - Introduce a new MRR managed view to improve calculation speed
- Stretch goals: Stripe OAuth integration to simplify setup even further + Polar integration

## Recap

### What did we do in Q3 2025?

A lot! Non-trivial work was done to guarantee we have a solid foundation for the Revenue analytics page using
data coming in both from events and Data Warehouse sources. We also released the product in Open Beta.

Non-exhaustive list:
- All required charts: MRR/ARR/Gross Revenue/Subscriptions/Customers Churn, etc.
- Max AI integration
- Access control to the dashboard + settings
- New breakdown filters
- Onboarding UI
- New `persons/groups_revenue_analytics` tables to be used by other teams
- MRR support for event sources

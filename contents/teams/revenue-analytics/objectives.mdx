## Q2 2025 Objectives

- Web Analytics-like default dashboard containing the following metrics, and its evolution over time
    - MRR
    - ARR
    - LTV
    - Churn
    - Growth
    - Retention
    - Expansion
    - Contraction
- Customer shouldn't need to configure anything besides connecting with Stripe
    - Opinionated settings on what revenue tracking should look like
    - Users don't need to be able to customize our assumptions about what their Stripe data looks like
        - This might change in follow-up quarters
- Expose streamlined revenue DW view to allow customers to improve on top of it `revenue_analytics` (or similar)
- Streamline Stripe connection
    - Improve UX to make it easier to track what's happening during setup
    - Allow connectors to be added directly from the new Revenue Analytics page
        - Keep track of progress while data is being imported into DW


### Stretch goal

If we find the time, it would be interesting if we could get a new connector.
This isn't a priority per se because most of our customers are using Stripe,
but it would be an important step to assure we're building a product generic enough to be extended to other revenue connectors.

- At least 1 new revenue connector (LemonSqueezy, RevenueCat, ChargeBee, etc.)

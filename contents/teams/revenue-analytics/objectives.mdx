## Q2 2025 objectives

- Web Analytics-like default dashboard containing the following metrics, and its evolution over time
    - MRR
    - ARR
    - LTV
    - Churn
    - Growth
    - Retention
    - Expansion
    - Contraction
- Customer shouldn't need to configure anything besides connecting with Stripe
    - Opinionated settings on what revenue tracking should look like
    - Users don't need to be able to customize our assumptions about what their Stripe data looks like
        - This might change in follow-up quarters
- Expose streamlined revenue DW view to allow customers to improve on top of it `revenue_analytics` (or similar)
- Streamline Stripe + ChargeBee connectors setup
    - Improve UX to make it easier to track what's happening during setup
    - Allow connectors to be added directly from the new Revenue analytics page, instead of going to the connectors page
        - Keep track of progress while data is being imported into DW


### Stretch goal

If we find the time, it would be interesting to update our Stripe setup to use the OAuth flow + create a PostHog [Stripe App](https://stripe.com/apps) -
will work very well with the [CRM team](/teams/crm): display PostHog data *inside* Stripe.

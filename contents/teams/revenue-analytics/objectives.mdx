    - Net Revenue
    - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
        - Revenue from subscriptions only
    - ARR (Annual Run Rate)

    - Active + New + Churned Subscriptions
    - ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
    - LTV (Lifetime Value)
    - Revenue/User Churn + Growth + Retention + Expansion + Contraction
- Closer integration with CRM and Max AI <TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo />
    - Let customers see data for a specific customer (B2C)
    - Let Max AI answer revenue-related questions using Revenue data
- Research whether it makes sense to use Data Warehouse-only data or if we should expand
into storing data separately to DW + use webhooks <TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo />


### Stretch goal

These aren't obligatory, but they'd be achievable if we could get the time + a new engineer on the team.

- Support ChargeBee and RevenueCat connectors <FutureTeamMember />
    - For ChargeBee this is simply creating the view mapping from our DW to our managed views
    - For RevenueCat this is a bit more complex because we'd need to create a new DW source
- Stripe OAuth integration to simplify setup even further - and display PostHog inside Stripe to foster adoption (great for CRM)

## Recap

### What did we do in Q2 2025?

A lot! Non-trivial work was done to guarantee we have a solid foundation for the Revenue analytics page using
data coming in both from events and Data Warehouse sources.

Non-exhaustive list:
- Split it off of Web Analytics' dashboard, with a basic Revenue Analytics page with focus on Net Revenue
- Reimplemented most of the breakdown/filtering logic so that it also works for Data Warehouse data rather than just events
- Guarantee customers simply need to connect their Stripe account to get started + improve Stripe setup UX
- Expose managed revenue analytics view to customers (and internally)
- Support revenue goals in our charts - which implied supporting goals globally for our insights
- Currency conversion support

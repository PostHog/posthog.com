This is a new team, so we'll be ironing out our goal with time ðŸ¤–.

We want to let teams understand what their revenue data means. Knowing how much they're making isn't enough.

People need to see at a glance how much they are growing, and how they compare to their peers. They need to see at a glance how much they are losing, and why.
They need to see at a glance how much they are spending, and what they are getting in return.
They need to see at a glance which of their customers have the most potential, and which are about to churn.

And not just that, they need that data to be actionable with our other tools. This team aims to make sure the data generated by it can be easily accessed by the other teams.

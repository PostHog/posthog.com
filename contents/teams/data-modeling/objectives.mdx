## Q1 2026 objectives

### Objective 1
- Endpoints GA
  - Pricing finalized and rolled out

### Objective 2
- Data modeling as a first-class citizen in app
  - Lineage view 
  - DAG execution + matviews are STABLE with better error surfacing, logging, and alerting

### Objective 3
- All the most common data modeling workflows are supported
  - Run all downstream models, run all upstream, run all with a user-defined tag, etc.
  - Model tests
  - Models are backed by git and can be synced / managed with GitHub

### Objective 4
- Stretch: a few data modeling differentiators
  - Field level lineage that feels nice
  - At least one custom PostHog node type in DAG execution (e.g. some model conditionally triggered 
  on cohorts, funnels, experiments, etc.)

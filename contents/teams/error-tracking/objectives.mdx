### Q4 2025 Objectives

#### Go all in on AI (Driver: <TeamMember name="David Newell" />)
* Implement issue autofixing
  * Integrate with Tasks product for in-app experience
  * Build terminal based experience within the CLI
    * Add issue selection to MCP (e.g. by file, most impactful)
    * Stretch: Add test writing agent to prevent regressions
* Add exception capture auto instrumentation to the wizard
* Integrations to capture exceptions for popular LLM / agent tools (e.g. Langchain)

#### Ship mobile error tracking (Drivers: <TeamMember name="Oliver Browne" />, <TeamMember name="Manoel Aranda Neto" />)
* [Sequencing TBD]
* Support suppression rules via remote config
* Add suppression of minified exceptions before cymbal processing
* Build dashboard template including crash free sessions / users

#### Research deep dive on customers (Driver: <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" />)
* Understand push & pull factors with competitors
* Understand the impression and usage of error tracking tools / workflows at AI-first companies
* Decide whether customers see LLM issues as exceptions
* Understand spend / contraction of existing customers
* Every engineer to attend at least 2 customer interviews

#### Increase trust in product (Driver: <TeamMember name="Hugues Pouillot" />)
* Improve issue grouping
  * Introduce a measure of grouping accuracy to base changes off
  * Add fingerprint versioning to avoid duplicate issues when iterating
  * Fix obvious mis-groupings based on minor stack trace variances
* RFC for moving issues into ClickHouse to avoid dual DB querying
* Reduce the number of stacktrace-less issues
* Give better context when a recording is not found / source maps missing

#### Improving context on issues  (Driver: <TeamMember name="Aleksander BÅ‚aszkiewicz" />)
* Add breakdowns to issues (by release / person_id)
* Show first affected release & relevant commit
  * Stretch: Auto assign to commit author
* Level up Node SDK (add contexts & tagging, $session_id propagation)
* Integrate logs into session timeline
* Capture code variables in Python

#### Better controls for capturing relevant issues
* Advanced snoozing (e.g. notify me if 100 more users affected)
* Adaptive sampling configuration
* Add billing limits to onboarding
* Setup threshold based alerting / management (e.g. stop capturing spiking issues)

#### Tracking spikes in usage
* billing, threshold based alerting
* update onboarding with more controls
* Alert me if I get more than 1000 issues in an hour
* Issues affecting more users

#### Simplify setup
- Rethink UI / UX of issue page
- Simplify alerting / grouping / assignment

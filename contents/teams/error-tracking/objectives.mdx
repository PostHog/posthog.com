#### **Collection** - Cymbal refactoring & Mobile support (Driver: <TeamMember name="Hugues Pouillot" />)
* Expose frame resolution and issue processing as endpoints
* Coordinate with Ingestion team to move cymbal processing into plugin server
* Make CLI compatible with stable chunk ids to:
    * be compatible with debug id specification and reuse current tooling.
    * avoid rebuilding application
    * speed up ingestion by reducing symbol set downloads
    * reduce symbol set uploads
* Add debug symbol upload command to CLI
* Support debug symbols with cymbal

#### **Monitoring** - Acquisition & KPIs (Driver: <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" />)

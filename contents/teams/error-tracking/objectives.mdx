### Q4 2025 Objectives

#### Go all in on AI (Driver: <TeamMember name="David Newell" />)
* Implement issue autofixing
  * Integrate with Tasks product for in-app experience
  * Build terminal based experience within the CLI
    * Add issue selection to MCP (e.g. by file, most impactful)
    * Stretch: Add test writing agent to prevent regressions
* Add exception capture auto instrumentation to the wizard
* Integrations to capture exceptions for popular LLM / agent tools (e.g. Langchain)

#### Ship mobile error tracking (Drivers: <TeamMember name="Oliver Browne" />, <TeamMember name="Manoel Aranda Neto" />)
* [Sequencing TBD]
* Support suppression rules via remote config
* Add suppression of minified exceptions before cymbal processing
* Build dashboard template including crash free sessions / users metric

#### Research deep dive on customers (Driver: <TeamMember name="Cory Slater" />)
* Interview existing, potential, and recently churned customers to understand:
  * What makes people switch from competitors and what pulls them back?
  * What value would convince customers to remove billing limits?
  * How do AI-first companies handle errors differently?
  * What context would let customers skip steps in their workflow? 
  * What drives month to month swings in spend vs contraction?
* Every engineer to attend at least 2 customer interviews

#### Increase trust in product (Driver: <TeamMember name="Hugues Pouillot" />)
* Improve issue grouping
  * Introduce a measure of grouping accuracy to base changes off
  * Add fingerprint versioning to avoid duplicate issues when iterating
  * Fix obvious mis-groupings based on minor stack trace variances
* RFC for moving issues into ClickHouse to avoid dual DB querying
* Reduce the number of stacktrace-less issues
* Give better context when a recording is not found / source maps missing
* Rethink UI / UX of issue page

#### Improving context on issues  (Driver: <TeamMember name="Aleksander BÅ‚aszkiewicz" />)
* Add breakdowns to issues (by release / person_id)
* Show first affected release & relevant commit
  * Stretch: Auto assign to commit author
* Level up Node SDK (add contexts & tagging, $session_id propagation)
* Integrate logs into session timeline
* Capture code variables in Python

#### Billing, spikes and alerts
* **Email** alerts for total exceptions ingested volume spikes
* Add billing limits to onboarding
* Fixed issue sampling (manually configured, drop X% of exceptions for this issue)
  * Stretch: Adaptive sampling (spread exception capture over billing period)
* Threshold based alerting per-issue, based on product analytics insight alerts
  * Support "X occurrences per Y duration"
  * Add to alerting step during onboarding
  * Stretch: Support "X affected users per Y duration"
* Issue time-based snoozing (drop all exceptions for X hours/days, re-open the issue if seen after that period)

#### Simplify setup
- Rethink UI / UX of issue page
- Simplify alerting / grouping / assignment

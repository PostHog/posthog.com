## Who are we building for?

### Primary (building for, churn indicates product failure)

#### Product & Growth Engineers
- JTBD: Get notified when new issues happen / escalate, identify impact, have context to fix
- Why prioritize: champion persona who adopts ET

#### Founders
- JTBD: Same as above but specifically want to know when early users face **any** exception
- Why prioritize: YC/high-potential, core to get-in-first strategy at product-led startups shipping multiple times/week


### Who we somewhat support (product will fully support them in time but we’re ok with churn in the short term)

#### DevOps/SRE Engineer
- JTBD: Cost control, release tracking, cross-service correlation, custom grouping for high-volume services
- Why: we will ideally support these use cases but do not have full coverage right now (missing releases UI, automatic request ID instrumentation, complex snoozing / alerting rules based on thresholds, logs integration)

#### AI/ML Engineer (emerging)
- JTBD: Track LLM quality degradation, hallucinations, cost explosions (non-traditional "exceptions")
- Why: might churn to specialized tools while we work on integrating deeper with LLMA

#### Support Engineer
- JTBD: Quick context on user-reported errors to triage severity, share details with product engineers
- Why: not a regular user but happy to support requirements that are a subset of the primary persona


### Who we’re not building for (do not expect the product to be of great value)

#### Product Managers
- JTBD: Understand which bugs block conversion/revenue, help prioritize by business impact

#### Vibe coders
- JTBD: Be informed of improvement to metrics from automatic bug fixes
- Why: Engineers in our ICP companies (high-growth startups, and those who could become that) generally do not vibe code their products

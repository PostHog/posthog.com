### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1: People think of PostHog as a mobile solution

* Mobile replay for React Native
* Launch & charge for mobile replay
* Lots of content on how to use PostHog on Mobile

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2: Error tracking in beta

* the top 5 features implemented
    * SDKs capture errors in one front-end and one back-end language (almost certainly JS and Python)
    * Stack traces are actionable and human-readable
    * Similar errors are grouped together
    * High-volume errors trigger the Alerting system
    * Integrated with other products such as Session replay
* real customers using it and giving us feedback
* integrated with CDP for notifications
* integrated with replay for investigation

### Goal 3: Hire two more people into the team

* as a goal because hiring takes time
* we want to add two people to the team so that we can stop choosing between what to work on

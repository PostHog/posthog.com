## 🚀 Goal 1: Get Hayne rocketing

It's great to have Hayne on the team, let's make the time and priority to make it a success!

## 👀 Goal 2: Make Replay low-maintenance 🔧

* Clean up legacy features and finish outstanding migrations from old to new
   * Move everyone to PostHog recorder
   * Remove support for Blobby V1
   * Remove LTS feature and related Celery tasks
* Improve fidelity - let's squash the filtering bugs and visual inconsistencies that make Replay seem "rough" to use
* Improve debugging facilities - it can be hard to reproduce issues locally or get our hands on the data we need, let's build the internal tooling needed to solve that

## ⌚ Goal 3: Replay everywhere!

* When a recording doesn't exist, explain why!
* Make the view recording buttons consistent
* Make the view recording buttons session aware
* Out with modals, in with tabs!
* Where else can we link to recordings from within other products?
* External integrations - jam.dev? GitHub? ZenDesk? Linear? FreshDesk? Jira? Trello?

## 🏎️ Goal 4: Make Replay compliant 

* Let's shred some recordings 🤘

## 💰 Goal 5: How are our unit economics trending?

How have recent infrastructure changes impacted our unit economics? Is our pricing still competitive?

## 👨‍🔬 Goal 6. Make "show me something interesting" tangible

Customers want us to highlight interesting moments and sessions, but that means different things to different people. Can we generate a library of what Interesting means to our customers?

## 🚀 Goal 1: Get Hayne rocketing

It's great to have Hayne on the team, let's make the time and priority to make it a success!

## 👀 Goal 2: Make Replay low-maintenance 🔧

* Clean up legacy features and finish outstanding migrations from old to new
* Improve fidelity - let's squash the filtering bugs and visual inconsistencies that make Replay seem "rough" to use
* Improve debugging facilities - it can be hard to reproduce issues locally or get our hands on the data we need, let's build the internal tooling needed to solve that

## ⌚ Goal 3: Replay everywhere!

* When a recording doesn't exist, explain why!
* Make the view recording buttons consistent
* Make the view recording buttons session aware
* Out with modals, in with tabs!
* Where else can we link to recordings from within other products?
* External integrations - jam.dev? GitHub? ZenDesk? Linear? FreshDesk? Jira? Trello?

## 🏎️ Goal 4: Make Replay compliant 

* Let's shred some recordings 🤘

## 💰 Goal 5: Refresh price comparisons

Are we still competitive? Do recent infrastructure improvements change things?

## 👨‍🔬 Goal 6. Refresh our understanding of how replay gets used and where we can derive more value faster

Talk to customers who love replay and customers who churned. Learn what makes them pay vs leave. Hone in on questions like:
- How do they find replays to watch?
- What makes an individual replay interesting/valuable?
- Where do they want replays to show up? (in posthog? external tools?)
- What workflows have they built around replay?
- Why do they churn or turn down volume?

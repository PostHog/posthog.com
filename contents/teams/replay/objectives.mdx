## ðŸš€ Goal 1: Get Tue rocketing

It's great to have Tue on the team, let's make the time and priority to make it a success

## ðŸš€ Goal 2: Keeping momentum on the things that are working

Just because it's a new quarter doesn't mean existing work disappears

Over recent months we've primarily talked to people for specific reasons mostly session summarization
Let's talk to some happy users.

We want to get feedback on recent changes (@veryayskiy) and find out why people are happy and what keeps them happy (all)

And we'll drive through on (at least):

* Commenting on recordings 
* Weekly digest (which has great retention)
* Cinema mode
* filtering changes

## Goal 3: Make support take less time

We've fixed all the easy bugs (honest) and now what's left are support tickets that can each take multiple days of complicated work... that's no good, let's make it easier or remove it all together. This will mean incremental rollout of recorder changes, resolving performance issues, easier rrweb debugging, and more

This will affect us all as we do support rotations, but @pauldambra will lead on this

## Goal 4: Act on results of the churn survey (@veryskyiy)

[The churn survey is giving great insight](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/802 )... let's react to that. For sure, it's telling us that often the solution is already there and easy _and_ folk aren't able to find it. We can improve the settings presentation, and the onboarding flow. If nothing else.

# Then there are things that folk are consistently asking for 

## Goal 5: Recording retention (tue with paul)

Mostly folk want longer retention, sometimes (around GDPR) they want shorter retention. This is a great up-sell opportunity and a great way to delight customers. We'll need to reorganise how we manage files in blob storage, keep a handle on storage costs, and improve the UI and querying.

## Goal 6: Recording deletion (@verayskiy)

We infrequently get requests for deleting recordings in batches. There's no good sulution here and it's always a bad time for folks. We can support batch recording and make these support journeys awesome.
    
## Goal 7: Conditional recording 3000 (@pauldambra)

We've got customer sponsors here who want to do more complex triggering than we support, let's make this spark joy. Support e.g. different sample rates for different SDKs. Or multiple different groups of triggers.

The groundwork is in the SDK - now we act on it.

## Goal 8: Working with customers who are building on top of us (@veryayskiy)

More and more people are building on top of us. We've not designed for that, and don't understand their needs. We want to understand this (_but not only that_) we want to improve this experience. It's currently a drain on infra and on those customers time. This might be batch export out to S3, but we're concerned folk don't want to pay for this...

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1: People think of PostHog as a mobile solution

* Mobile replay for React Native
* Lots of content on how to use PostHog on Mobile

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2: Error tracking in beta

* the top 5 features implemented
    * Grouping
    * Stack traces
    * SDK support
    * Alerting
    * Integrated with other products (this one is less important than the other 4 for me)
* real customers using it and giving us feedback
* integrated with CDP for notifications
* integrated with replay for investigation

### Goal 3: Hire two more people into the team

* as a goal because hiring takes time
* we want to add two people to the team so that we can stop choosing between what to work on

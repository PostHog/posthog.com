# 📱Goal 1: People think of PostHog as a mobile solution

* onboard Yiannis and get him rocketing
* mobile replay out of beta
* flutter replay

# 📹 Goal 2: Replay playback 3000

* onboard Richard and get him rocketing
* Replay UX Overview
    * we've invited @corywatilo to our November offsite where we will decide what this means for the last eighth of the year... 
* replay playback performance
    * we believe that if we improve playback we will see waiting time decrease, watch time increase, and number of recordings watched increase
    * we believe that those metrics are strong proxies for customer satisfaction in replay

# 🎤 Goal 3: Ship the things users keep asking for

* queryable network data
* start replay on trigger e.g. event
* magic playlists

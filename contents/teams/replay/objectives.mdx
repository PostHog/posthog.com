it's great to have Alex 2 on the team... let's make it a success

# 👩‍🔬 Goal 2: Find the needle in the haystack

* Understand the needles that people are looking for using user interviews, data analysis and more 
* Better options for users to watch recordings from where they are (e.g. in funnels or experiments) 
* Some people are scared of filtering, some people have no patience for it - give them ways to avoid it
* Make it super easy to see what filters have results to watch - "show me, don’t make me figure it out"

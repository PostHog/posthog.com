### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1: Quality and Consolidation for Session Replay (web & mobile)

Why? 

We've done a lot of investigation and preparation work and we want to capitalize on that

* Mobile replay out of beta for Android/iOS
* Make capture and playback as complete, performant and easy as possible
* Build the best UX for finding and playing recordings

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2: Error tracking MVP

Why? PostHog is "The single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features". Having network timings, network payloads, and console errors in Session Replay is a great developer tool. We want to learn by doing to understand how we could capture and expose even more information here to help people dig into what is happening with their products

* Building on top of the existing `$exception` ingestion
* Getting it in the hands of real users, so that we can collect feedback on how to best solve their problems
* This can't be a fully featured error tracking product at first release but it can be a valuable increment
* see https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/569

### Goal 3: Hire two more people into the team (1 full-stack/product and 1 mobile engineer)

Why? We want to do even more than we already do, but with just three engineers if someone were to be ill we lose a third of our throughput. Let's reduce the bus factor by adding 2 amazing new colleagues

## 🚀 Goal 1: Get Kim and Hayne rocketing

It's great to have new folk on the team, let's make the time and priority to make it a success

## 👀 Goal 2: See the value of each recording - deep integrations into other tools @TueHaulund with @veryayskiy

* Build on the manual crisp and intercom integrations to make it easy to add replay into every support tool
* Easy link to share clips to github/linear/jira etc
* Easy links from salesforce
* Easy links to AI/vibe-coding platforms
* A zendesk app to have two way links
* more ...?

### Why?

Replay is a great debugging and support tool, let's help folk discover that

## ⌚ Goal 3: See the value of each recording - nail watching in context @veryayskiy

For example....

It’s hard to get from a funnel to the recordings for the funnel. It should be easy to watch them, summarise them, track them

imagine being able to ask Max: "hey max, 12% of people drop off this funnel at step 2 - summarize those sessions and tell me why"

And not just funnels but everywhere

* If a recording doesn’t exist, upsell adding it - make it easy to know why i can’t watch, and make it easy to watch the ones i do have
* get from where you are (flag, funnel, insight, etc) to the point in time in the recording
* split the list of recordings out of the actors modal
* view recording button should be session aware

### Why?

Folk should be able to watch the recordings they need to where they are, without needing to figure out how to find them in replay

## 💰 Goal 4: Refresh price comparisons @fivestarspicy supported by us all

Are we still competitive? Do recent infrastructure improvements change things?

## 🏎️ Goal 5: Replay the rocket @pauldambra with @TueHaulund

We hear (some) people tell us replay is slow... let's fix that

* Snappy in the browser so we don’t need to decompress in the API
* Don’t load the whole 2hour recording to play it
* Performance in the browser generally for playback
* Performance impact when recording
* Listing speed should be blazing fast
* Precache the recording homepage data when you login or start a session?

### Why?

Replay is awesome, waiting for things is not

## 👨‍🔬 Goal 6. Refresh our understanding of how replay gets used and where we can derive more value faster @fivestarspicy 

Talk to customers who love replay and customers who churned. Learn what makes them pay vs leave. Hone in on questions like:
- How do they find replays to watch?
- What makes an individual replay interesting/valuable?
- Where do they want replays to show up? (in posthog? external tools?)
- What workflows have they built around replay?
- Why do they churn or turn down volume?

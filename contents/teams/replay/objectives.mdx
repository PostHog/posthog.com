# üöÄ Goal 1: Get Alex rocketing

it's great to have Alex on the team... let's make it a success

# üë©‚Äçüî¨ Goal 2: Churn and retention exploration

We've had a lot of technology focus, let's have some product focus

This is a relatively vague goal, because we don't know enough to be specific. The goal is at a minimum to get to a place where we're operating from good knowledge

* Bucket users into "contracted, but still using the product", "churned (from paying), but still using the product" and "churned, and stopped using the product"
* Interview 5 customers in each bucket, try survey/email outreach if necessary to increase amount of feedback
* Run 5+ experiments based on learnings
* come out of this quarter either happy we can focus elsewhere or with a strong understanding of where to go next
* talk to those users
* find good metrics
* run experiments to improve things
* come out of this quarter either happy we can focus elsewhere or with a strong understanding of where to go next

# üé§ Goal 3: Watch less and get more value

We've got good evidence that some customers need help finding which recordings to watch. We want to help people more quickly find the right recordings to watch.
And logically once you have more than ~1 hour of recordings a day you can't watch them all and need help finding the valuable ones

* HogBot 
    * part 1 was very simple but people liked it... let's grow HogBot
    * bring people back into the product from email or slack by highlighting what they want to watch
* Magic playlists
    * playlists are not used much but people who use them like them and have diverse reasons
    * we can autogenerate useful playlists and prompt you when they have new recordings
* Filtering
    * if you have more recordings captured than you can watch in the time you have available, how can we guide you to watch the most valuable recordings

# üíÄ Goal 4: Squash distractions

1) Get our deployment of rrweb under control
    2024 was interrupted by tech twiddling of rrweb. Ugrades, patching, contributing upstream.

    It was unpredictable and disruptive. We've got a good relationship with the contributors and made some improvements but we need to get past this!

    * incremental rollouts of rrweb and recorder changes
    * no more patching of npm packages

2) Write optimised blob-ingestion

    CDP are going to do this but will take at least @pauldambra's time in support

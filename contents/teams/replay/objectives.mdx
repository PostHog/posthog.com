# ðŸš€ Goal 1: Get Tue rocketing

Get Tue rocketing!

# Goal 2: Talk to users (all?)

Over recent months we've primarily talked to people for specific reasons mostly session summarization
Let's talk to some happy users

* people who are happy
   * Letâ€™s link up with Sales and CS since theyâ€™re already talking to users
   * And talk to a bunch of happy users
    * What keeps them happy that they wouldnâ€™t want us to change
    * What one thing could we do to take them from happy to ecstatic
 * People who have used recent changes and find out what worked for them?
    * What to watch
    * In-page filtering

# ðŸš€ Goal 3: Keeping momentum on the things that are working

* Commenting on recordings (@pauldambra)
    * Search by comments
    * Emoji comment
* Weekly digest (@pauldambra)
    * Track retention of groups that see it vs donâ€™t
    * Talk to them and see what led them to click through
* Playback UI (@veryayskiy)
    * Mix-max 
        * is searching by text accurate enough
        * follow-up questions good enough
        * does it always create valid filters
    * Cinema mode
        * should close activity inspector

# Goal 4: Make support take less time

This will affect us all as we do support rotations, but @pauldambra will lead on this

* Replay debugging / support load (@pauldambra)
    * One debugger (https://posthog.github.io/rrwebdebug.com/)
    * Good playgrounds
* Solidify the incremental rollout flow so itâ€™s safer to release new recording code
* Recording playback performance problems
    * A very small number of users hit some pathological case in the playback code
    * For those users it doesn't matter that it doesn't affect most people since it really affects them
    * Weâ€™ve also got some amazing, patient customers willing to work with us
    * Added benefit that we can contribute back upstream if the solution is inside rrweb

# Goal 5: Act on results of the churn survey (@veryskyiy)

 * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/802 
 * Prompting folk on settings to reduce opt-out on settings page
     * settings
     * privacy
     * compliance

Then there are things that folk are consistently asking for 

# Goal 6: Recording retention (tue with paul)

    * Longer retention  (Tue with Paul supporting)
        * This comes up often enough that it would be awesome to support it
        * Plus the existing longer retention implementation is at best O(n)
        * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/766
        * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/738
        * I think it would be a pretty powerful upsell

    * Shorter retention  (Tue with Paul supporting)
        * some customers want to only keep recordings for 30 days (e.g. GDPR)
        * not currently possible

# Goal 7: Recording deletion (@verayskiy)
    * Some customers want to delete recordings **but not one a time** (@veryayskiy)
        * two needs here!
             * i don't want to see this -> soft delete
             * i don't want to store this -> hard delete
        * sometimes this is "delete all recordings because accidental PII" (we have break glass for this)
        * sometimes this is "delete specific recordings because accidental PII" -> this is tricky right now
        * sometimes this is "ha ha hah i have figured out a hack to get free recordings by deleting them before you charge me" -> user education needed

   > note: activity log and access control
   >     * all of these things need to go in the activity log to help track this down
   >     * the new access control work might need to take it in to account

# Goal 8: Conditional recording 3000 (@pauldambra)
    * Weâ€™ve levelled up conditional recording but it could be much more cool
    * E.g. sample 20% of mobile recordings but 60% of web recordings
    * Or trigger with flag X at 20% sampling, event Y at 50% sampling, and on URL matching Z at 1% sampling

# Goal 9: Working with customers who are building on top of us (@veryayskiy)
    * Folk building on top of us is a new user group for us (and we don't measure their revenue separately ðŸ¤”)
    * Currently theyâ€™re using our API which is a poor experience for everyone and we want this to be great for us and them
    * batch exports?
        * We can learn from / work with existing batch exports code
        * And have a temporal flow to copy recordings to a provided S3 bucket
        * we need to find out if folk would _pay_ for this though
        * so good chance we need to validate this before we build it
        * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/767
    * the solution might actually be "make a different API for this"

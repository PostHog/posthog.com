# üöÄ Goal 1: Keeping momentum on the things that are working

* Commenting on recordings (@pauldambra)
    * Search by comments
    * Emoji comment
* Weekly digest (@pauldambra)
    * Track retention of groups that see it vs don‚Äôt
    * Talk to them and see what led them to click through
* Playback UI (@veryayskiy)
    * Mix-max
    * Cinema mode

# üë©‚Äçüî¨ Goal 2: Add things folk are asking for

* Longer retention (Tue with Paul supporting)
    * This comes up often enough that it would be awesome to support it
    * Plus the existing longer retention implementation is at best O(n)
    * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/766
    * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/738
    * I think it would be a pretty powerful upsell
* Conditional recording 3000 (@pauldambra)
    * We‚Äôve levelled up conditional recording but it could be much more cool
    * E.g. sample 20% of mobile recordings but 60% of web recordings
    * Or trigger with flag X at 20% sampling, event Y at 50% sampling, and on URL matching Z at 1% sampling
* Batch exporting (@veryayskiy)
    * Folk building on top of us is a new user group for us
    * Currently they‚Äôre using our API which is a poor experience for everyone
    * We can learn from / work with existing batch exports code
    * And have a temporal flow to copy recordings to a provided S3 bucket
    * we need to find out if folk would _pay_ for this though
    * so good chance we need to validate this before we build it
    * https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/767
    * the solution might actually be "make a different API for this"

# Goal 3: Make support take less time

This will affect us all as we do support rotations, but @pauldambra will lead on this

* Replay debugging / support load (@pauldambra)
    * One debugger (https://posthog.github.io/rrwebdebug.com/)
    * Good playgrounds
* Solidify the incremental rollout flow so it‚Äôs safer to release new recording code
* Recording playback performance problems
    * A very small number of users hit some pathological case in the playback code
    * For those users it doesn't matter that it doesn't affect most people since it really affects them
    * We‚Äôve also got some amazing, patient customers willing to work with us
    * Added benefit that we can contribute back upstream if the solution is inside rrweb

# Goal 4: Talk to users @veryayskiy

Over recent months we've primarily talked to people for specific reasons mostly session summarization
Let's talk to some happy users

* Let‚Äôs link up with Sales and CS since they‚Äôre already talking to users
* And talk to a bunch of happy users
    * Have recent changes worked for them?
       * What to watch
       * In-page filtering
    * What keeps them happy that they wouldn‚Äôt want us to change
    * What one thing could we do to take them from happy to ecstatic
* And keep analysing info from churned users
    * Should we be prompting folk to turn on conditional recording?

# üöÄ Goal 1: Get Alex rocketing

it's great to have Alex on the team... let's make it a success

# üë©‚Äçüî¨ Goal 2: Churn and retention exploration

We've had a lot of technology focus, let's have some product focus

This is a relatively vague goal, because we don't know enough to be specific. The goal is at a minimum to get to a place where we're operating from good knowledge

* find the user groups (e.g. low recording count vs high recording count)
* talk to those users
* find good metrics
* run experiments to improve things
* come out of this quarter either happy we can focus elsewhere or with a strong understanding of where to go next

# üé§ Goal 3: Watch less and get more value

We've got good evidence that some customers need help finding which recordings to watch. We want to help people more quickly find the right recordings to watch.
And logically once you have more than ~1 hour of recordings a day you can't watch them all and need help finding the valuable ones

* HogBot 
    * part 1 was very simple but people liked it... let's grow HogBot
    * bring people back into the product from email or slack by highlighting what they want to watch
* Magic playlists
    * playlists are not used much but people who use them like them and have diverse reasons
    * we can autogenerate useful playlists and prompt you when they have new recordings

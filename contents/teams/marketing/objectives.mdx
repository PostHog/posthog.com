## Best practices for AI code editors

- **Owned by:** Danilo
- **Motivation:** We want to make it incredibly easy to integrate PostHog using Cursor and other AI coding agents. Goal is to ensure LLMs follow best practice on initial integration and prevent the sort of long-term skew that happens when the agent takes unhelpful initiative.

  - Single-prompt integrations for 3-5 popular frameworks
  - Cursor rules integrated **and updated** via wizard for each framework and at least five of our major products
  - Public posts explaining what we've figured out and how other developers can apply it
- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - We measure growing usage of the wizard, especially events related to updating the docs
  - Vibe coding enthusiasts love using our approach
  - People say "this is how it's done"

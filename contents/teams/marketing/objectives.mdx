## Product focus: Web analytics

- **Rationale:** We want to focus most of our marketing efforts around a single product, giving the team greater focus. We're choosing web analytics because it's recently out of beta and has strong adoption already.

- **Owned by:** Lior and Ian

- **Contributors:** Andy and others where needed

- **What we're shipping:**
  - Great web analytics docs
  - Comparisons for main competitors
  - Alternatives guides for main competitors
  - Better privacy docs and advice (GDPR consent etc.)
  - Proper web vs product analytics guide
  - Loads of relevant tutorials and SEO content
  - Social ads for web analytics

- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - We see increasing usage of web analytics
  - More people choosing web analytics at onboarding
  - Growing word of mouth for PostHog as a web analytics tool (brand mentions)

## Content focus: Newsletter

- **Rationale:** We've built a successful newsletter, but we need to aim higher. We want to ship more ambitious and original articles. Our ultimate long-term goal is people should talk about Product for Engineers in the same, or similar, terms as Lenny's Newsletter. A "default" newsletter that is synonmous with quality.

- **Owned by:** Andy

- **Contributors:** Ian, Lior, James Hawkins and anyone else who wants to get involved.

- **What we're shipping:**
  - Bar raising issues of the newsletter
  - Working toward a higher frequency of issues
  - Potentially new newsletter formats
  - Andy attempting to become a LinkedIn influencer #youreathoughtleadernowharry

- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - We ship newsletters we're very proud of
  - People talk about the newsletter like they do our brand / website
  - Increasing word of mouth and organic growth of the newsletter  

## Merch that's popping off

- **Rationale:** We've got some great new designs being printed. Next stage is to get them stocked and create buzz around how great our merch is.

- **Owned by:** Lottie

- **Contributors:** Whole marketing team where needed

- **What we're shipping:**
  - Merch printed and in the store
  - Photoshoot for the store + social promotion
  - A whole bunch of stuff to promote the merch online (TBD)

- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - People buy and wear our stuff
  - Proved via photos and posts on social media
  - People choosing to buy it without a merch code / giveaway

## Kickass billboards

- **Rationale:** We have a bunch of billboards booked for Q1 2025. We should have something on them, I guess? Solid plan.

- **Owned by:** Charles

- **Contributors:** Lottie, Cory, and James

- **What we're shipping:**
  - Billboard designs shipped on time
  - A Q4 campaign to create buzz and get people talking
  - Q1 2025 online campaigns to run at same time as billboards

- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - We've shipped. Results will come in Q1 2025.
  - Real love for the billboards and shares on social.
  - Increase in branded search that coincides with the campaign.    

## Hire someone to own paid ads and incentive schemes

- **Rationale:** We spend a decent amount on paid ads on Google and LinkedIn, but it doesn't have a full-time owner. Time spent here by Andy distracts him from things he'd rather be doing and is better at. We'd also like to explore creating a referral and/or affiliate scheme, but don't have capacity to do so internally.

- **Owned by:** Andy

- **Contributors:** Charles

- **What we're shipping:**
  - Job spec with aim to start hiring once we've onboarded new hires to content team.
  - A clear hypothesis about what we want this person to do and how we'll evaluate success.

- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - We've hired someone who kicks ass and drives growth, or...
  - ...we decide to focus hiring efforts elsewhere, but probably the former.

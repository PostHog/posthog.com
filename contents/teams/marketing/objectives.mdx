### Docs that spark joy (Ian)

**Rationale:** Some of our documentation has fallen behind the product and there are pockets that fall well short of our current standards. This is a reputational risk if left unresolved.

**Contributors:** Ian, Andy, Lior + product teams

**What we'll ship: (WIP)**
- Best practice guides for:
  - Session replay
  - A/B testing
  - Surveys
- Much better HogQL docs
- Updates to support pipeline team with their goals
- Continue expanding web analytics and data warehouse docs as they roll out
- Update or remove any old/low quality docs
- Optimize docs index pages for desire paths / FAQs

**We'll know we're successful when:** Feedback from community / on social that our docs are great, and feedback from product teams.

### Support CS in their sales-led activities (Joe)

### Q1 2026 Objectives

- *Going deeper on messaging*: 
  - Messaging is still the most common Workflows use case, and we want to serve it really well before focusing broadly on Workflows features.
	- What we’ll ship: 
    - The most-requested features from our users
    - Broadcasts (aka Batch workflows)
    - Recurring / cron-job workflows
    - New native PostHog messaging channels (Push, SMS)
    - Behavioral targeting (do _X_ only if user has not performed _Y_ event in last _N_ days)
- *Gear up for Workflows General Availability*:
	- As we prepare Workflows for a broader release, we’re focusing on reliability and day-to-day usability, especially when things go wrong.
  - What we'll ship:
    - Improved observability (clear run history for past and future workflow invocations, logs, and debugging tools)
    - Better previews for messages on all channels so that users feel confident in their comms
    - High level insights around email deliverability to allow users to proactively monitor spam reputation
    - More product documentation for new and existing users
- *Inter-product triggers*: 
	- Today, Workflows is powerful, but integrations across PostHog product aren’t yet consistent
	- What we’ll ship: At least one solid, repeatable integration pattern for triggering workflows from other PostHog products, or letting users configure workflows based on product events

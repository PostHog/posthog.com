## Goals: Q2 2024

1. Batch exports UX improvements, e.g. error notifications and UI rewamp
   - why: helps reduce confusion around how batch exports work reducing support, also cost savings
1. Person data batch export
   - why: Its currently only possible to have event data but person data is needed for full analysis downstream
1. Support adding new products
   - why: helping other teams ship faster while ensuring the stability of existing products
1. Iterate on person processing to make it faster and cheaper
   - why: this is the slowest part of the pipeline
1. Visibility into what's in the ingestion queues and past performance
   - why: To help reduce time to incident resolution and help find bottlenecks
1. Fast configuration options to speed up incident recovery, e.g. by token send to overflow or drop
   - why: To help reduce time to incident resolution
1. Deprecate `posthog-events` by moving to `capture-rs` fully
   - why: the new capture-rs service is improving reliability and efficiency and all events should benefit from it
   - ingestion of session replays is out of scope for this quarter
1. [Deprecate scheduler & jobs deployments, `runEveryX` plugins and async migrations](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/21656)
   - why: Reduce operational and support load and costs

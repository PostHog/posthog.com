# Mission for 2026

1. **We own video production 100% end-to-end.** This means having limited dependencies on other teams for scripts, animation, thumbnails, or any other elements required to ship video projects. This doesn't mean we don't work with other teams, but we shouldn't be reliant on them.

2. **A successful YouTube channel.** Success means a channel with a regular publishing schedule of short and long-form videos that we're proud of, that generate thousands of views organically, and a channel that's growing and generating awareness of the PostHog brand and product. 

3. **Every tier 1 launch has supporting video content.** This means having one or more video assets for major new product launches, either on the date of general availability or shortly afterwards. It doesn't mean supporting every announcement we do.

# Q1 2026 Goals

## Work with Marketing Team to support a tier 1 launch with video

* **Owner:** Alex  
* **Motivation:** We want tier 1 launches to always have robust, high-quality video assets. We'll pick one launch in Q1 to do this with, ideally Array.    
* **What we'll ship:** We think the ideal suite of videos for a launch is a feature video (e.g. Why we built X), a more technical deep dive / demo video, and short trailer-style video that we can use for ads, but these things will be defined in partnership with the marketing team and relevant product team.  
* **We'll know we're successful when:** A tier 1 launch in Q1 had awesome videos that people love.

## Ship season 1 & plan and shoot season 2

* **Owner:** Team  
* **Motivation:** We want the transition between season 1 and 2 to be seamless and ultimately reach a point where this becomes business as usual. We also want to define a bunch of repeatable video series that will become the foundation for the channel.  
* **What we'll ship:** Complete season 1 and shoot a second season of videos - during which we trial more well-defined series, and at least one big swing project.    
* **We'll know we're successful when:** We transition seamlessly and we have several video series that we're committed to producing in the medium to long-term.

## **Nail Changelog season two**

* **Owner:** Jordo  
* **Motivation:** Season 1 was great, but a big of a grind and we struggled to publish with the frequency we wanted. Season 2 is about nailing this and making it sustainable long-term.  
* **What we'll ship:** Reliably ship Changelog every two weeks, shorts for each individual item in the changelog, with more voice contributions from the team.   
* **We'll know we're successful when:** Production feels mostly effortless and we're confident we have a repeatable model that scales.

## **New demo video**

* **Owner:** Andy  
* **Motivation:** It's horribly out of date and bad. This needs to be fixed urgently.  
* **What we'll ship:** A new 5 to 7 minute video by the end of Jan that explains what PostHog is and covers some of the main use cases / benefits. This will not be a completely comprehensive video, more of an entry point and high-level overview.  
* **We'll know we're successful when:** We've shipped an up-to-date video and we can easily update when needed that covers the most valuable use cases and features.

## **Experiment with shorts**

* **Owner:** Andy  
* **Motivation:** I want to be able to produce video independently and shorts are a good place to start. Building out a library of short will also be useful for resurrecting HogTok etc.    
* **What we'll ship:** Shorts focused on tips and tricks to using PostHog, explaining what PostHog is, intros to features, and product easter eggs easter eggs. We may also try some more weird entertainment oriented ones, but TBD on that.  
* **We'll know we're successful when:** I can produce high quality shorts with minimal assistance from Alex and Jordo, and we see some traction and utility from publishing them.

## **Onboarding plan for new animator hire**

* **Owner:** Alex and Jordo  
* **Motivation:** We want to hire an animator and we want them to be able to have an instant impact and a clear roadmap of things we need from them.  
* **What we'll ship:** A detailed onboarding plan, have assets at the ready, have a list of needs and wants for them to work towards, etc.   
* **We'll know we're successful when:** New hire starts and they say the onboarding process was a dream and they feel like they know exactly how to contribute to the video team.

## Setup HogHouse London for regular video shoots

* **Owner:** Alex and Andy
* **Motivation:** Currently, a video shoot requires a fair bit of forward planning to book out studio space etc. If we can use HogHouse London as a shooting location, we can unlock doing adhoc shoots and reduce the friction here significantly, increasing our ability to ship more videos.  
* **What we'll ship:** Either a permanent space / area at HogHouse London where we can do shoots and / or a temporary shooting setup we can setup at short notice, secure storage of all necessary equipment, plus spec for lighting we can buy and store on-site. 
* **We'll know we're successful when:** We can shoot videos at days notice and we're using the space frequently for video shoots.

## **Improve case study videos**

* **Owner:** Jordo  
* **Motivation:** We're not happy with the quality of these videos. We're not committing major resources here, but we'd like to get them to a respectable level until we're ready to commit more time to making them great.  
* **What we'll ship:** Better resources for staff on how to record good quality videos (screen records) + making being more demanding on feedback to nail narrative and make these videos a bit tighter .   
* **We'll know we're successful when:** Videos, whether on YouTube or our website, have a consistent quality and polish (4k, good audio quality, coherent speaking, worthwhile-content, etc).

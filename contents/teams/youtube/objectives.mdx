# Team YouTube Goals for 2026

1. **We're owning all video assets end-to-end.** This means having very limited dependencies on other teams for scripts, animation, thumbnails, or any other elements required to ship video projects. This doesn't mean we don't work with other teams, but we shouldn't be reliant on them.

2. **We've created a successful YouTube channel.** Success means a channel with a regular publishing schedule of short and long-form videos that we're proud of, that generate thousands of views organically, and a channel that's growing and generating awareness of the PostHog brand and product. 

3. **Every tier 1 launch has supporting video content.** This means having one or more video assets for major new product launches, either on the date of general availability or shortly afterwards. It doesn't mean supporting every announcement we do.

# Team YouTube Q4 2025 Goals 

## Get to a healthier release cadence

**Owner:** Alex van Leeuwen & Jordan Dibb

**Motivation:** Current film release efforts have been ad hoc & irregular. To best build traction and have a more consistent structure to our efforts, we want to have some regularity to when we ship.

**What we'll ship:**

- Week 1: State of the Hog (with James and Tim)
- Week 2: Changelog Season 2 Starts (Changelog S2E1)
- Week 3: Hackathon Documentary Episode 1
- Week 4: Changelog S2E2 + Hackathon Documentary Episode 2
- Week 5: Hackathon Documentary Full Release
- Week 6: Changelog S2E3
- Week 7: Job interview questions engineers should ask (videos essay with James)
- Week 8: Changelog S2E4
- Week 9: The magic of small engineering teams (video essay with James)
- Week 10: Changelog S2E5
- Week 11: Product management is broken. Engineers can fix it (video essay with James)
- Week 12: Changelog S2E6

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

- We hit our release deadlines.
- We see growing engagement + channel subs with videos as we release more frequently
- If we miss our release deadlines, we can diagnose what needs to change to unblock this.

## Test a variety of different formats

**Owner:** Alex van Leeuwen & Jordan Dibb

**Motivation:** Shoot & release various types of film, to see which resonate most internally and externally.

**What we'll ship:** A mixture of one off content (e.g. the hackathon documentary episodes & then full release; Ship It); fun, branded content (State of the Hog & other YouTube-centric ideas to come); changelogs; educational content; video(s) around a single launch.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

- We see which of these formats work and which don't - and can identify why.
- Positive feedback from community and word of mouth about our cool videos.
- Foundational pieces to take into planning our video efforts for 2026.

## Changelog videos

**Owner:** Jordo

**Motivation:** Changelog is a core brand asset that we can use in lots of places. We want to push these out regularly while maintaining a high standard way above what most companies do.

**What we'll ship:**

* Changelog videos every two weeks  
* Distribution on all main social channels  
* Figure out email, website, in-app distribution for changelog vids

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* We can ship every two weeks without disrupting other video projects  
* Consistent engagement on social channels (X, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube)  
* Positive feedback from product teams and customers

## New demo video

**Owner:** Ian and Jordo

**Motivation:** Our existing demo video is completely out of date, but our most popular video. We need a new one.

**What we'll ship:** 

* Introductory platform demo video that explains why you should use PostHog
* Product-specific “modules" we can use in docs, product pages, etc.  
* Intro video \+ modules combined into one video  
* An archived (video, script) that will make updating the demo video in the future easier.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* The combined videos we publish get more combined views than the existing demo video.  
* Sales feedback that the demo video is helpful

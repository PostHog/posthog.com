## Get to a healthier release cadence

**Owner:** Alex van Leeuwen & Jordan Dibb

**Motivation:** Current film release efforts have been ad hoc & irregular. To best build traction and have a more consistent structure to our efforts, we want to have some regularity to when we ship.

**What we'll ship:**

- Week 1: State of the Hog (with James and Tim)
- Week 2: Changelog Season 2 Starts (Changelog S2E1)
- Week 3: Hackathon Documentary Episode 1
- Week 4: Changelog S2E2 + Hackathon Documentary Episode 2
- Week 5: Hackathon Documentary Full Release
- Week 6: Changelog S2E3
- Week 7: Job interview questions engineers should ask (videos essay with James)
- Week 8: Changelog S2E4
- Week 9: The magic of small engineering teams (video essay with James)
- Week 10: Changelog S2E5
- Week 11: Product management is broken. Engineers can fix it (video essay with James)
- Week 12: Changelog S2E6

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

- We hit our release deadlines.
- We see growing engagement + channel subs with videos as we release more frequently
- If we miss our release deadlines, we can diagnose what needs to change to unblock this.

## Test a variety of different formats

**Owner:** Alex van Leeuwen & Jordan Dibb

**Motivation:** Shoot & release various types of film, to see which resonate most internally and externally.

**What we'll ship:** A mixture of one off content (e.g. the hackathon documentary episodes & then full release; Ship It); fun, branded content (State of the Hog & other YouTube-centric ideas to come); changelogs; educational content; video(s) around a single launch.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

- We see which of these formats work and which don't - and can identify why.
- Positive feedback from community and word of mouth about our cool videos.
- Foundational pieces to take into planning our video efforts for 2026.


## Changelog videos

**Owner:** Jordo

**Motivation:** Changelog is a core brand asset that we can use in lots of places. We want to push these out regularly while maintaining a high standard way above what most companies do.

**What we'll ship:**

* Changelog videos every two weeks  
* Distribution on all main social channels  
* Figure out email, website, in-app distribution for changelog vids

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* We can ship every two weeks without disrupting other video projects  
* Consistent engagement on social channels (X, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube)  
* Positive feedback from product teams and customers

## New demo video

**Owner:** Ian and Jordo

**Motivation:** Our existing demo video is completely out of date, but our most popular video. We need a new one.

**What we'll ship:** 

* Introductory platform demo video that explains why you should use PostHog
* Product-specific “modules" we can use in docs, product pages, etc.  
* Intro video \+ modules combined into one video  
* An archived (video, script) that will make updating the demo video in the future easier.

**We'll know we're successful when:** 

* The combined videos we publish get more combined views than the existing demo video.  
* Sales feedback that the demo video is helpful

## Who are we building for?

We've built 3 [platform packages](/platform-packages) for companies at different stages of growth.


### Boost

**Best fit:** Early-stage startups gaining traction that need access control, white labeling, or HIPAA compliance without enterprise complexity.

**Persona:** Technical founders

**Reasons to upgrade to Boost:**

- The team started running more experiments and feature flags in parallel, need to protect them from accidental changes -> access control
- Started using embedded surveys and want to remove PostHog branding -> white labeling
- A healthtech company needs to be HIPAA compliant -> BAA agreement
- User data protection becomes critical -> 2FA and SSO enforcement
- An agency or embedded analytics startup needs to keep customer data in separate projects -> unlimited projects


### Scale

**Best fit:** Growing companies with multiple teams that need role-based access, audit trails for compliance, and centralized authentication.

**Persona:** Managers and team leads

**In more detail:**

- Orgs with multiple teams using PostHog:
    - Need to control who can access what -> role-based access control
    - Want visibility into changes -> activity logs and approvals
    - Require centralized authentication -> SAML via identity provider
- Companies that need to meet SOC 2 compliance -> activity logs for audit trails
- Companies with strict internal support SLAs that need to ensure their providers meet them too
- Orgs where analysts and data engineers are responsible for data quality and need to control which events are sent -> ingestion taxonomy, schema validation


### Enterprise

**Best fit:** Large organizations that need automated identity management, SCIM provisioning, and full audit trails.

**Persona:** IT security officers and IT admins

**In more detail:**

- Orgs that have outgrown manual user management and need to automate admin processes:
    - Automated identity management -> SAML with SCIM provisioning
    - Centralized access control -> role-based permissions
    - Full visibility into who did what and when -> audit trails and automatic alerts

## Who we're NOT building for

- **Solo builders and hobbyists** using PostHog for personal projects, don't need collaboration features, don't have budgets for addon packages
- **Small teams (<10 people) at early-stage startups** without compliance requirements, happy managing users manually, and prefer everyone-has-full-access setup
- **Traditional enterprises** requiring dedicated one-off feature development, or on-premise deployments

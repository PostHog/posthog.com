## Who we're building for

We've built 3 [platform packages](/platform-packages) for companies at different stages of growth.

### Boost

**Boost is a good fit for:**

- Startups that are gaining traction: 
    - More experiments are running, feature flags are used for critical parts of the product -> need to control access
    - Want to run more surveys to collect feedback and remove PostHog branding -> white labeling
    - User data protection becomes critical -> 2FA and SSO enforcement
- Companies with strict access policies that need to limit access to sensitive dashboards and/or specific projects
- Health companies that need to be HIPAA compliant -> BAA agreement
- Agencies or embedded analytics products that need unlimited projects to separate their customers' data

**Persona:** Technical founders

### Scale

**Scale is a good fit for:**


- Orgs with multiple teams using PostHog:
    - Need to control who can access what -> role-based access control
    - Want visibility into changes -> activity logs and approvals
    - Require centralized authentication -> SAML via identity provider
- Companies that need to meet SOC 2 compliance -> activity logs for audit trails
- Companies with strict internal support SLAs that need to ensure their providers meet them too
- Orgs where analysts and data engineers are responsible for data quality and need to control which events are sent -> ingestion taxonomy, schema validation

**Persona:** Managers and team leads

### Enterprise

**Enterprise is a good fit for:**

- Orgs that have outgrown manual user management and need to automate admin processes:
    - Automated identity management -> SAML with SCIM provisioning
    - Centralized access control -> role-based permissions
    - Full visibility into who did what and when -> audit trails and automatic alerts

**Persona:** IT Security Officers and IT Admins

## Who we're NOT building for

- **Solo builders and hobbyists** using PostHog for personal projects, don't need collaboration features, don't have budgets for platform packages
- **Small teams (<10 people) at early-stage startups** without compliance requirements, happy managing users manually, and prefer everyone-has-full-access setup
- **Traditional enterprises** requiring dedicated one-off feature development, or on-premise deployments

## Q1 2026 objectives

### Fence off non-ingestion services from persons DB

In order to have a single point of reference for all persons DB access so that any future changes to the underlying storage are seamless to the users.

- Persons Read API for all non-ingestion services
- Partial Persons Write API for non-ingestion services

### Introduce rate / usage limits

So that certain patterns of system abuse are handled without manual intervention from the team.

- Rate Limiter API integrated into capture
- Fair rate limits that don't upset customers
- Public documentation on the rate limits

### Move Error Tracking ingestion to ingestion platform

To simplify the ingestion codebase specific to Error Tracking, allow the team to reuse generic ingestion platform tooling, and reduce their maintenance burden.

- Production-ready ingestion pipeline for Error Tracking that uses Cymbal

### Implement core features for the ingestion platform

- Ingestion Pipelines Framework ready for broader rollout (docs, tutorials, tooling, etc.)
- Better infrastructure for spinning up new ingestion pipelines (charts, automation, observability)
- Tools for managing dead letter queues
- Event restrictions available to all ingestion pipelines
- Ability to create temporary ingestion pipelines for testing

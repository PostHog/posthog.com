## Q2 objectives

### Fix property definitions service

We identified several problems with the current implementation of property-defs, which we want to fix in Q2:

- Improve scalability
- Improve data consistency
- Break out its data store
- Reduce the troubleshooting effort

### Finish moving to capture-rs

We are still running the Django capture service, and we need to transition away from it. In Q2, we will:

- Move all capture endpoints to capture-rs
- Improve team's confidence in maintaining the capture layer

### Develop ownership of ingestion incidents

As the product has matured and the traffic has increased, we need to improve our incident response process. This quarter we'll focus on:

- Developing a solid process for managing incidents and followups
- Bring more discipline to handling alerts, and exceptions
- Improve documentation on troubleshooting ingestion problems
- Reducing the incident response times

### Improve infrastructure for deployments

We're too slow and have too little confidence in the ingestion deployment process. Our plan is to:

- Switch to a more feature-flag-oriented development process
- Move all ingestion components to ArgoCD
- Investigate other mechanisms to reduce the risk of deployments, e.g. blue/green, faster rollbacks

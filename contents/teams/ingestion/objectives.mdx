## Q3 objectives

### Prepare the system for 4x the traffic

We need to improve several pieces of the ingestion pipeline to support the increase in traffic:

- Make persons database horizontally scalable
- Support 4x ingestion throughput
- Make deployments smoother
- Optimize Kafka consumers

### Design system architecture for next 10x growth

We will be able to scale the system horizontally for some time, but we’re expecting to hit some harder limits soon after that. We need to understand how we’re going to scale the system further:

- Implement a PoC for the next generation ingestion architecture
- Make an informed decision on how far Postgres will take us

### Improve operational maturity

We’re working on improving the reliability of the ingestion pipeline, so that the system performs better for the customers and we have fewer distractions from shipping features:

- Improve ingestion and infrastructure dashboards
- Make ingestion logs usable
- Write runbooks for incident response for out-of-hours incidents

### Reduce event duplication

We’ve received support requests and questions from customers about event duplication. We would like to provide a solution that solves the majority of the problem:

- Add metrics for event duplication
- Ship an improvement for at least one source of event duplication

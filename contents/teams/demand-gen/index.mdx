## Demand Gen Overview

**We generate demand so the product doesn't have to do all the work.**

That means two jobs: bring high-quality leads to sales, and convert engineers searching for us (or our competitors) into signups. We try to make both of those things fun -- or at least not painful to look at. "Data Daddy is here to help" is a real headline we're running on search.

No stuffy awareness campaigns. No creepy third-party pixels. We run ads on Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, and YouTube, and we'll check out new platforms as we find them, while killing the channels that don't work. Our goal is to run copy and creative that's funny enough to screenshot.

## Why This Team Exists

We're in a good spot. High-quality inbound leads are flowing thanks to word of mouth and general brand love. That won't last forever.

Four reasons this team exists:

- **Content builds awareness, we close the loop.** Someone might read a blog post, love it, and then bounce. We want to make sure they have a path back when they're ready to try a product.
- **Lead flow isn't guaranteed.** Inbound looks great now, but pipelines take 4–6 months to fix once they start to flatten. By the time you notice, you're already behind, so we want to stay ahead of that.
- **Not every engineer hangs out in the same places.** Some are on Reddit, others are on LinkedIn (yes, really!), others head straight to Google based on recommendations from elsewhere. We make sure we're showing up in all the places that our ICP is.

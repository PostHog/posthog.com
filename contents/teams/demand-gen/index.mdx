## Demand Gen Overview

**We generate demand so the product doesn't have to do all the work.**

That means two jobs: bring high-quality leads to sales, and convert engineers searching for us (or our competitors) into signups. We try to make both of those things fun—or at least not painful to look at. "Data Daddy is here to help" is a real headline we're running on search.

No stuffy awareness campaigns. No creepy third-party pixels. We run ads on Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, and YouTube, and we'll check out new platforms as we find them. We've killed the channels that didn't work. We test a lot, keep what converts, and try to run copy and creative that's funny enough to screenshot.

Weird, punchy, useful. That's the brief.

## Why This Team Exists

We're in a good spot. High-quality inbound leads are flowing thanks to word of mouth and general brand love. That won't last forever.

Two reasons this team exists:

- **Content builds awareness. We close the loop.** Someone might read a blog post love it, and then bounce. We're here to make sure they have a path back when they're ready to try a product.
- **Competitors are bidding on our keywords (and theirs).** If we're not showing up when engineers search for analytics, feature flags, or session replay, someone else is.
- **Lead flow isn't guaranteed.** Inbound looks great now, but pipelines take 4–6 months to fix once they start to flatten. By the time you notice, you're already behind. We stay ahead of that.
- **Not every engineer hangs out in the same places.** Some are on Reddit others are on LinkedIn. Many of them Google for solutions when they realize what they have isn't working. We meet them where they are and show them a better world is possible.

## Demand Gen Overview

Technically, the demand gen team is comprised of two parts:

1. Demand capture through our search ad efforts
2. Demand gen through our outbound efforts

### Why This Team Exists

We're in a strong position today. We've got a healthy volume of high-quality inbound leads driven by word of mouth and general brand love/awareness. That won't last forever.

There are two main reasons this team exists:

- **Lead flow can't be taken for granted.** Inbound may look great now, but it takes 4–6 months to fix a pipeline once it starts to flatten. By the time you realize it's slowing, you're already behind. This team will ensure we stay ahead of the curve.
- **Cross-selling gets harder as we scale.** In larger organizations, different teams often own different tools. One team might be responsible for analytics, another for feature flags. That makes it harder to grow within existing accounts. Smart, personalized ABM (account-based marketing) helps AEs and CSMs expand usage across teams.

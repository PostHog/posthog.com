### Q4 2024 Objectives

- **Objective 1**: Get to a 4/10 in Enterprise platform support (Zach)
  - Release Enterprise addon and iterate with sales to find a pricing model that makes sense
  - Build RBAC
  - Reasoning: As a company we want to have a 4/10 support for enterprise - and our platform needs to support that.
  - Metrics: RBAC is at a place where enterprises who require it can actually use it.
- **Objective 2**: Make revenue & forecasting more reliable (Patricio)
  - Rejig how we do sync_invoices so we donâ€™t see big drops - respond to webhooks instead of large syncs
  - Evaluate temporal vs celery for usage reports and billing tasks so we can adhere to rate limits better
  - Side hustle, if time permits: Rejig how anonymous / identified events are billed, as the current implementation is confusing.
- **Objective 3**: Activation: reverse trials, analytics onboarding flow, understand CC activation (Raquel)
  - Dig into the data, watch replays to figure out why CC activation rate has been falling
  - Add reverse trial to onboarding
  - Add reverse trial to billing page for teams
  - Reasoning: Our CC activation rate has been falling and we aren't really sure why. We should figure it out and try a few things to improve it. I also want to continue my focus on analytics activation that I finally got to start last quarter that I didn't get to finish!
  - Metrics: Improved CC activaiton rate. Increase in people who sign up for Teams. Increase in people who successfully activate into product analytics and replay.

Stretch goals:
  - API query pricing (Raquel & Patricio)
  - Move the annual credits flow out of Zapier

### Danilo

- Make it easy to integrate PostHog using Cursor and other AI coding agents.
- Ensure LLMs follow best practice on initial integration and prevent the sort of long-term skew that happens when the agent takes unhelpful initiative.
- **What we're shipping:**
  - Single-prompt integrations for 3-5 popular frameworks
  - Cursor rules integrated **and updated** via wizard for each framework and at least five of our major products
  - Public posts explaining what we've figured out and how other developers can apply it
- **We'll know we're successful when:**
  - We measure growing usage of the wizard, especially events related to updating the docs
  - Vibe coding enthusiasts love using our approach
  - People say "this is how it's done"

### Extras

_These are meant as nice to haves if we have time or you feel inspired_

- Improve the experience of creating your first insight for product analytics (e.g. suggested insights)

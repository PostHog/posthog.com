### Q2 2024 Objectives

- **Objective 1**: Create a flow in product analytics onboarding to fill out a dashboard template using actions (Raquel)
  - Reasoning: Templates are useful for getting people to valuable insights quickly, but they have to wait for data to come in before they can use themes. If we use actions, they can be made right away.
  - Metrics: Percent of new orgs that activate increases, retention goes up or stays the same, people actually use the flow.
- **Objective 2**: Simplify our subscription flows (Zach, supported by Raquel)
  - Reasoning: Subscribing to PostHog can be very confusing. To get platform features, you have to subscribe to any Product. And what does it mean to be subscribed to one product but not another?
  - Metrics: Conversion rate to subscribed should increase, complaints about unexpected charges should not go up.
  - You don't sub to products individually, you instead just add a CC to the platform
  - If you have a CC in, you're charged for any usage you accrue
  - Pricing page reflects these changes
- **Objective 3**: Launch pricing pricing changes (Bianca, Raquel)
  - Personless events - will help us reach more customers at an affordable price
  - Data warehouse - it's becoming pretty useful, we should charge for it
  - Session replay - we can reduce costs to improve retention and reach more people

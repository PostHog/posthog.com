### Q3 2024 Objectives

- **Objective 1**: Make onboarding awesome for Product analytics and Data warehouse (Raquel)
  - Use templates, toolbar, and actions in analytics onboarding so people can get to insights more quickly.
  - Work with data warehouse team to make a bespoke flow to help people get their first integration set up.
  - Reasoning: Templates are useful for getting people to valuable insights quickly, but they have to wait for data to come in before they can use themes. If we use actions, they can be made right away. For DW, none of our current onboarding steps for getting data in are relevant - we need to think through this from scratch.
  - Metrics: Percent of new orgs that activate increases, retention goes up or stays the same, people actually use the flow.
- **Objective 2**: Support self-serve annual commitments
  - Reasoning: Annual commitments means we get more money now, reduces churn risk, and can be cheaper for customers. But, people have to talk to sales right now to get on these contracts. If they could self-serve this, we could theoretically sell more of them.
  - Metrics: We have the feature, and people use it.
- **Objective 3**: Dive into the data to understand our billing metrics and customers better (Zach)
  - Reasoning: We want to know:
      - How the startup program is performing and how we should change things there
      - How well we cross-sell and how that can be improved
      - Why CC input rate is going down, even though signups are going up.
      - If we can trust the revenue number every single day
- **Objective 4**: Keep up with ongoing needs from our team:
  - Hire 2 people onto the team - one billing focused, one auth/permissions or growth focused (Raquel)
  - Launch pricing for Data warehouse (likely soon)
  - Launch pricing for CDP (if it's ready)

If we have time:
  - Build a better billing page that gives breakdowns by project, is easier to mentally parse, is more beautiful, etc.

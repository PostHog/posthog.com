## Q1 2026 objectives

### Integrations

<TeamMember name="Matt Brooker" photo /> will be focusing on integrations with external partners.

- GA launch 1 integration with an AI partner + 1 new AI partner integration
- Finish Vercel integration and have PostHog included in the Feature Flags integration page
- Stretch: have PostHog and Vercel more tightly integrated (analytics, replay, experiments, logs)

### Cross-sell

<TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo /> will be working on cross-sell improvements.

- Improve sidebar cross-selling algorithm
  - Add ML model or make it suggest products in a smarter/more frequent way

### Post-onboarding

<TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo /> will be working on improving the post-onboarding experience by making it less overwhelming.

- Bring "Quick Start" into the main part of the app and into each individual product
- Introduce the concept of "Product health" like we have on Web Analytics (iterate on it, it's not the best UI/UX right now, but it's a great step on the right direction)
- Tighter integration with Wizard to have more accurate empty states for Prod Analytics
  - Know what events exist, etc.
- Add some more up-and-front PostHog AI prompts "how do I do X?", "How does my retention look like?"

### Experimentation culture

<TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo /> <TeamMember name="Matt Brooker" photo /> will get more used to running tiny experiments in search of huge ROI.

- Every other Friday is Experiments Friday where we spend the day working on a (some) tiny experiment(s)

### Stretch goals

- Explore a take on how we could better use AI on our onboarding flow

## Q4 2025 recap

## Next quarters

Non-exhaustive list of things we want to work on eventually:
- 10x the toolbar
- One-click migration away from competitors
- Spin up an SDK team
- Agent Analytics? SDK Analytics? MCP Analytics?
- Demo environment for customers to try out PostHog with existing data (and relatable to their own business domain)
- PostHog-billed AI SDK
  - Don't need to setup an AI account in each provider, just use PostHog's AI SDK.
- Improved ingestion URL (dynamic, harder to block/guess)
- New products playground

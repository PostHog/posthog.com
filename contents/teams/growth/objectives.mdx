## Q4 2025 objectives

This team is now back online after a short time of having no assigned engineers to it - the old team did such a great job they now have their own product!

This is also only a half quarter for this team, plus we're onboarding <TeamMember name="Matthew Brookes" photo />.


### Cross-Sell

<TeamMember name="Rafael Audibert" photo /> will be working on cross-sell motions to continue easing our customers into adopting more of our products - that's our moat.
- Make use of the huge amount of data we capture for product intent signals inside PostHog.
- Work with [Team Platform UX](/teams/platform-ux) to improve the sidebar experience for onboarding.
- Expose PostHog signals to Array.
- Stretch goal: Consolidate PostHog Ads concept (using the sidebar? using notifications? using email marketing?)

### Integrations

<TeamMember name="Matthew Brookes" photo /> will be working on integrations with external partners to drive growth. We already have an MCP and Array but we don't closely integrate with partners.
- Get AI tools to integrate with us - this can be either via an MCP or custom integration.
- Focus on increasing top of funnel adoption - the more sign ups/orgs created the better!


## Next quarters

Non-exhaustive list of things we want to work on eventually:
- 10x the toolbar
- One-click migration away from competitors
- Spin up an SDK team
- Agent Analytics? SDK Analytics? MCP Analytics?
- Demo environment for customers to try out PostHog with existing data (and relatable to their own business domain)
- PostHog-billed AI SDK
  - Don't need to setup an AI account in each provider, just use PostHog's AI SDK.
- Improved ingestion URL (dynamic, harder to block/guess)
- New products playground

## What the Growth team does

We operate under a triple mandate - albeit one easier than the FED's: increase top of funnel acquisition, ensure successful activation, and increase cross-sell between products.
 
- Activation
  - Global onboarding flow
  - Develop tooling for individual product onboarding and activation
  - Help product teams leverage the tooling to create best-in-class onboarding & activation flows for their products
- Product led growth
  - Develop new products and strategies to increase top of funnel
  - Integrate with external partners to drive growth
- Product cross-sell
  - Track and measure cross-sell between products
  - Identify the right time to cross-sell different products to different users
  - Work with marketing to experiment on cross-sell initiatives outside the app
  - Build bridges to other products that appear when customers might benefit from them

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the <SmallTeam slug="growth" /> can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

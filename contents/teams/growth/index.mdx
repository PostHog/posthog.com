## What the Growth team does

We operate under a triple mandate - albeit one easier than the FED's: increase top of funnel acquisition, ensure successful activation, and increase cross-sell between products.
 
- Activation
  - Global onboarding flow
  - Develop tooling for individual product onboarding and activation
  - Help product teams leverage the tooling to create best-in-class onboarding & activation flows for their products
- Product led growth
  - Develop new products and strategies to increase top of funnel
  - Integrate with external partners to drive growth
- Product cross-sell
  - Track and measure cross-sell between products
  - Identify the right time to cross-sell different products to different users
  - Work with marketing to experiment on cross-sell initiatives outside the app
  - Build bridges to other products that appear when customers might benefit from them

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the Growth team can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

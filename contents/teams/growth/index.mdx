## What the Growth team does

We operate under a double mandate - albeit one easier than the FED's: increase top of funnel acquisition while increasing cross-product activation.
 
- Activation
  - Global onboarding flow
  - Develop tooling for individual product onboarding and activation
  - Help product teams leverage the tooling to create best-in-class onboarding & activation flows for their products
  - Improve cross-product pollination
- Product led growth
  - Develop new products and strategies to increase top of funnel
  - Integrate with external partners to drive growth

## How to work with the Growth team

In addition to covering specific areas of the product, members of the Growth team can temporarily join other small teams to execute jointly on growth-related tasks.
This can be done by requesting help during Sprint planning, or at the beginning of the Quarter during the OKR definition phase.

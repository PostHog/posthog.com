## What this team does

We own the reliability, stability, and performance of the feature flags targeting service and local evaluation endpoints.

Here are some of the things we own:

- **Feature flag evaluation API** - both the soon-to-be-legacy `/decide` endpoint and the new `/flags` endpoint
- **Local evaluation** - ensuring fast, reliable flag evaluation at the edge

For the flag management UI and SDKs, see the [Feature Flags](/teams/feature-flags) team.

We write Rust and Python. We care deeply about latency, uptime, and making flags fast everywhere.

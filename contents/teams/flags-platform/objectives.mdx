### Q1 2026 Objectives

This quarter we're focused on reliability, performance, and cleaning house. No incidents, sub-100ms P99, and deleting legacy code that's holding us back.

#### Short-mid term reliability focus — <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

**Goal: No incidents.**

- **Isolated flags-specific infra** — Run the flags service on entirely dedicated infrastructure (Redis cache ([RFC #909](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/909)), read replica DB, celery queue, etc.) rather than sharing with other services.
- **Load testing framework** — Add tooling so we can load test the flags service

#### Long term service improvements — <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

**Goal: Sub-100ms P99, consistent responses.**

- 10x scaling the flags service
- New architecture vision — can we decouple flag evaluation from the database? can we make the service even faster so that folks don't need to use local eval if they want a better experience?

#### "This house is clean" — <TeamMember name="Matheus Batista" photo />

Pay down tech debt and simplify the codebase.

- Delete all the code that backs `/decide` — it's not used anywhere, so let's get the cruft out of there
- Split out `remote_config` from `/flags`
- Get `/local_evaluation` in a good state — low cost to run, good performance

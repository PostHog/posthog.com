### Q1 2026 Objectives

This quarter we're focused on reliability, performance, and cleaning house. No incidents, sub-100ms P99, and deleting legacy code that's holding us back.

#### Short-mid term reliability focus — <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

**Goal: No incidents.**

- **Dedicated Redis cache** — Isolate flags from shared infrastructure. [RFC #909](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/pull/909)
- **Load testing framework** — Add tooling so we can load test the flags service
- **Flags-specific read replica** — Reliable DB access that doesn't depend on shared infra

#### Long term service improvements — <TeamMember name="Phil Haack" photo />

**Goal: Sub-100ms P99, consistent responses.**

- 10x scaling the flags service
- New architecture vision — can we decouple flag evaluation from the database? can we make the service even faster so that folks don't need to use local eval if they want a better experience?

#### "This house is clean" — <TeamMember name="Matheus Batista" photo />

Pay down tech debt and simplify the codebase.

- Delete `/decide`
- Split out `remote_config` from `/flags`
- Get `/local_eval` in a good state — low cost to run, good performance

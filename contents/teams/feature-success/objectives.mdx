As always, reliability is the #1 unwritten goal: Making sure feature flags are reliable trumps every other objective.

### Objective: Make sure feature flags can handle 10x current scale

Last quarter we hit some scaling limits on flags: It's now very expensive to run flags on Django and we'll hit some scaling limits at 5x our scale.

To get ahead of this problem, we'll rewrite our flags service to be more performant and reliable.

### Objective: Polish new experiments UI & collect feedback

Last quarter we finished a basic version of our new experiment UI. This quarter, we want to polish this up, collect feedback from users, and address any issues that come up.

Broadly, we should:
1. Make it easy for people to set up experiments and understand the results, with clear action items on when to end and what to do after ending experiments.
2. At every stage of the experiment, tell people what to do next
3. Have common sense boundaries, and better running time predictions, and more resilient significance calculations (flip-flopping problem)
4. Make sure support for experiments goes down as a result of the above^


### Objective: Add most requested surveys functionality

We will, in order of priority build:

- Event based targeting for surveys
- Branching logic with multiple questions

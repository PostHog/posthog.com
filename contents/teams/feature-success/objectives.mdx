As always, reliability is the #1 unwritten goal: Making sure feature flags are reliable trumps every other objective.


### Objective: Doubling down on surveys

Last quarter, we officially launched surveys and gathered lots of feedback! This quarter, we're building out more of the things that'll make surveys the obvious choice for customers to collect user feedback. 

We will, in order of priority build:

- Event based targeting for surveys
- Branching logic with multiple questions
- Better result visualisation for customer experience metric surveys (NPS, CSAT, etc)

### Objective: Doubling down on experiments

Last quarter, we built out the core missing features for feature flags. Now to leverage these building blocks we want to focus on improving our A/B testing platform.

Broadly, we will focus on two themes:

1. Make it easy for people to set up experiments and understand the results, with clear action items on when to end and what to do after ending experiments.
2. Expand what is possible to track in experiments: From statistical significance for secondary metrics, to having a linked dashboard for extra result exploration.

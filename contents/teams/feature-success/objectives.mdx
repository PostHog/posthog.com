As always, reliability is the #1 unwritten goal: Making sure feature flags are reliable trumps every other objective.

### Objective: Make sure feature flags can handle 10x current scale

Last to last quarter we hit some scaling limits on flags: It's now very expensive to run flags on Django and we'll hit some scaling limits at 5x our scale.

To get ahead of this problem, we'll rewrite our flags service to be more performant and reliable. This is a continuation of last quarter's goal, since we aren't done yet.

### Objective: No-code experiments 

Last quarter we polished up our new experiment UI. This quarter, we want to address some issues that came up, and then focus on building out some more ambitious features on top of experiments.

Broadly, we will:
1. Address outstanding experiments UI/UX issues
2. Build no-code experiments
3. Split out experiments into its own product
4. Explore some cool things we can do on top of no-code experiments, like suggesting and automatically running some no-code experiments based on replay and analytics data

Software product development is changing. It's faster, less predictable, and more open to disruption than ever before, and the role of software engineers is evolving to match it.

We believed this long before AI coding agents became genuinely useful, but their emergence only intensifies the need to rethink how software gets made. 

Today, a decent engineer can achieve more than they ever realistically could before. As a consequence, teams that stick to the old assumptions and boundaries of "engineering work" will flounder. Teams that embrace a broader definition will out ship and outperform them, and do so while working within smaller, more efficient teams.

Those high-performing teams will be led by product engineers. Unlike a traditionally defined full stack engineer, a product engineer's job goes beyond shipping code. It's about engineering every aspect of the product and what makes it successful. 

Product engineers talk to users. They decide what to build. They own pricing, revenue, and user experience. They support customers directly. They're accountable primarily to their users and paying customers. They own product decisions.

Product engineers still work with product managers, but they're not ruled by them. It's a fundamentally different dynamic, one that requires leaders to relinquish command and control measures. A dynamic that defaults to trust and autonomy. A dynamic that gives *everyone* permission to be ambitious.

## Why should I read this? 

The Product Engineer Handbook is about helping developers embrace this new reality. The good news? You can wake up tomorrow and decide to be one. You don't need anyone's permission, least of all ours. All you need is an open mind, a love of building, and the desire to learn.

Reading this handbook will help you understand how to adapt your thinking, the behaviors you should adopt, and the skills you should develop to become a successful product engineer. It'll also help you learn the basic concepts that underpin the business of building successful software businesses.

We'll share how adopting this mentality has helped us grow PostHog, and how others are applying it too. Just like our company handbook, the Product Engineer Handbook is a living document. One we will be growing, fine-tuning, and iterating on for a long time. 

If you enjoy it, you should sign up to our newsletter, Product for Engineers, so you don't miss out on new chapters. Got a request for something we should add to the handbook? Leave a comment anywhere, or ask a question.

## Defining the product engineer

Can anyone be a product engineer? Possibly. Tools like Cursor, and Claude Code make it easier than ever for anyone with enough knowledge and determination to build products that users love.

In the most general terms, however, a product engineer is a software developer who builds products for *real users*, writes full stack code, and cares deeply about solving the "hair on fire" problems of their users.

For us this means product engineers need to be: 

* Directly responsible for improving the product and building new features.  
* Opinionated on the roadmap and future of the product.  
* Able to make design decisions to create great user experiences independently.  
* Enjoy supporting users directly – all our product engineers also do support.  
* More willing to build a product from scratch for users when needed.  
* Less loyal to features they’ve added in the past.  
* Aware of how their product and work fits into the company's strategy.  
* Primarily motivated by the impact of their work and outcomes.

We're not alone in thinking this way. [incident.io](http://incident.io) sums up product engineers as developers who:

> "Care more about outcomes and impact than the exact implementation, or the tools used to solve the problem."

Jean-Michel Lemieux, former VP of Engineering at Shopify, [defines them](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sherifmansour.medium.com/product-engineers-f424da766871&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1761835262328469&usg=AOvVaw2su1uJJy27pS33s0wD130e) as:

> "Engineers who have a thirst for using technologies to leapfrog human/user problems. Those with empathy to reach for magical experiences."

Lee Robinson, VP of Product at Vercel, [says](https://leerob.com/n/product-engineers) product engineers "work backwards from the desired product experience" to the technologies that enable it:

> "They consider the frontend, backend, design, and everything in between to create a great user experience. They don't need to understand every part deeply, a common misconception of "fullstack". Instead, they have a broad understanding of the available tools and deep experience *applying* those tools to build products."

Gergely Orosz, The Pragmatic Engineer, describes what he calls [product-minded engineers](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/#tips-to-become-a-more-product-minded-engineer) as:

> "Developers with lots of interest in the product itself. They want to understand why decisions are made, how people use the product, and love to be involved in making product decisions. They're someone who would likely make a good product manager if they ever decide to give up the joy of engineering."

In sum, a product engineer is someone who cares more about the outcomes and impact of their code on users than the implementation. Their goal is creating a great product for users. A product that solves real problems and, ultimately, sparks joy.

## Why become a product engineer?

Developers used to spend years learning the specifics of a language’s syntax, the architecture of components, and understanding how language turns into a running application. This was core to creating value in software.

Today, the value of these skills is being driven down: anyone can pay $20 for a machine that spits out code that often, sort of, works. In a world where anyone can have enormous piles of mostly-working code, code is not enough on its own to create an advantage.

But here’s the good news: it never was.

AI can't build your business. You can't plug a large language model into your hosting account and expect it to print money.

Code that works isn’t just code that compiles, it’s code that creates results. Results for customers who depend on it. Results for the business that maintains it. Code that keeps the lights on gives you more leverage to reach your goals.

Developers who understand and embrace a broader definition of their role, who obsess over the impact of their work on real users, are more employable. They're more valuable to the teams and products they work on. They're more likely to find satisfaction in their work.

In our experience, nothing is more motivating than working with other talented product engineers. The speed, scale, and ambition of problems you can tackle when product engineers work together is on a different level.

As Ant Wilson, CTO and co-founder of Supabase, [notes](https://supabase.com/blog/who-we-hire):

> "When you find all of the above traits in a single person, your definition of the word ‘feasible’ changes dramatically. At the start of every product cycle, we ask the question “what is the most ambitious thing we can hope to achieve in the next 3 months?”, and the team never fails to push the boundary on what we previously considered reasonable." 

And, as one of our colleagues, Danilo Campos, shared in Slack recently:

> "We are surrounded by optimists. By people who want things to work, and believe in their bones things CAN work. An astonishing amount is possible when talented people BELIEVE it’s possible. It’s so much fun to do the things you’re good at when everyone is happy you’re good at them."

If this sounds good to you, you should keep reading.

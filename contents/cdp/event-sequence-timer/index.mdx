ðŸš§ **Note:** We are currently in the process of reworking our app server and have therefore **disabled new installs of the event sequence timer.** You can still analyze the timing of event sequences using [HogQL](/docs/hogql). See our [documentation](/docs/cdp/event-sequence-timer) for more details.

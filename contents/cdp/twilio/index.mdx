        <h5>Send SMS alerts automatically</h5>
        <p>
            Keep users notified of everything from new logins and bill payments to errors and outages. If you track it
            with PostHog, it can be a trigger in Twilio.

        <h5>Avoid spamming users</h5>
        <p>
            Worried about sending too many messages? Set a timeout period of between one second and one year to avoid
            annoying users with repeated notifications.

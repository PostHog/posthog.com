### What does the Google Cloud Storage Export app do?

The Google Cloud Storage Export app enables you to send events from PostHog to a Google Cloud Storage bucket upon ingestion. 

### What are the requirements for this app?

The Google Cloud Storage Export app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)! 

You'll also need access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket you want to export to. 

### How do I install the PostgreSQL Export app?

Before installing the Google Cloud Storage Export app, you will need your Google Cloud .json file. Find out how to get this in [Google's BigQuery API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries).

1. Visit the 'Apps' page in your instance of PostHog.
2. Search for 'GCS' and select the app, press Install and proceed to Configuration.
3. Upload your Google Cloud key .json file.
4. Enter your Project ID.
5. Enter your bucket name.

### Is the source code for this app available?

PostHog is open-source and so are all apps on the platform. The [source code for the Google Cloud Storage Export app](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-gcs-plugin) is available on GitHub. 

### Who created this app?

We'd like to thank PostHog team member [Yakko Majuri](https://github.com/yakkomajuri) for creating the Google Cloud Storage Export app. Thanks, Yakko! 

### What if I have feedback on this app?

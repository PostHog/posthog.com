### What does the GitHub Release Tracker app do?

The GitHub Release Tracker adds an [Annotation](/docs/user-guides/annotations) to PostHog whenever a specified repo launches a new GitHub release. This is useful for correlating the impact of new releases on other metrics, such as sign-ups, as well as other performance-related issues. 

### How do I install the GitHub Release Tracker for PostHog?

1. Log in to your PostHog instance
2. Click 'Apps' on the left-hand tool bar
3. Search for 'GitLab Release Tracker' 
4. Select the app, press 'Install' and follow the on-screen instructions

The GitHub Release Tracker requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later.

### What does the PagerDuty Connector do?

This app alerts PagerDuty when a PostHog insights/trends graph goes below or above a threshold.

Example use cases:

- Alert when there is no $pageviews captured on my site the past hour,
- Alert when the rate of $billing_error events crosses a threshold.

### What are the requirements for this app?

The PagerDuty Connector app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)! 

You'll also need access to a PagerDuty account.

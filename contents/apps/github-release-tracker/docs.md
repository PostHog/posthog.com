### What does the GitHub Release Tracker do?

This app enables you to tracker releases in GitHub as events in PostHog. This is useful for correlating releases with user behaviour or performance issues, for example. 

### What are the requirements for this app?

The GitHub Release Tracker requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)!

If you want to track releases from a private GitHub repo, you'll also need access to it. 

### How do I install the GitHub Release Tracker for PostHog?

1. Log in to your PostHog instance
2. Click 'Apps' on the left-hand tool bar
3. Search for 'GitHub Release Tracker' 
4. Select the app, press 'Install' and follow the on-screen instructions

### Is the source code for this app available?

PostHog is open-source and so are all apps on the platform. The [source code for the GitHub Release Tracker](https://github.com/PostHog/currency-normalization-plugin) is available on GitHub.

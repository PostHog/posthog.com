### What does the Migrator 3000 app do?

The Migrator app enables you to move events from one PostHog instance to another, so that you can move from a self-hosted instance to a PostHog Cloud deployment, or vice versa. 

### Does the Migrator 3000 app move all content to the new instance?

No, this app will only migrate events and objects derived from events, such as persons. Dashboards, Insights, Feature Flags, etc. will not be migrated and must be manually recreated on the new instance.

### What does the Salesforce Connector do?

This app connects to your Salesforce instance, sending events from PostHog to Salesforce as they are ingested. 

## What are the requirements for this app?

The Salesforce Connector app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)! 

You'll also need a Salesforce account to connect to, as well as the relevant levels of access to install and configure this app. 

## How do I install the Salesforce Connector app for PostHog?

1. Log in to your PostHog instance
2. Click 'Apps' on the left-hand tool bar
3. Search for 'Salesforce' 
4. Select the app, press 'Install' and follow the on-screen instructions

### What does the Salesforce Connector do?

This app connects to your Salesforce instance, sending events from PostHog to Salesforce as they are ingested. 

### What are the requirements for this app?

The Salesforce Connector app requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)! 

You'll also need a Salesforce account to connect to, as well as the relevant levels of access to install and configure this app.

1. Log in to your PostHog instance
2. Click 'Apps' on the left-hand tool bar

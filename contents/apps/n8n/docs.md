### What does the n8n Connector app do?

This n8n app enables you to automate PostHog workflows and create workflows using other services, using n8n. 

### How do I get started with the n8n Connector app?

The n8n app is an API integration. You will need a [PostHog Personal API key](https://posthog.com/docs/api), which must be [authenticated with n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/posthog/) in order to [connect n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.posthog/#basic-operations) and get started.

For more information, please check [n8n's integration documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/posthog/#posthog).

### What are the requirements for this app?

Using the n8n Connector requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)! 

### Where can I find out more?

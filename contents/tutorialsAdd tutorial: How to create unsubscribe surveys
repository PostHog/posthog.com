# How to create unsubscribe surveys

Unsubscribe surveys are a simple way to learn why users are leaving your product or mailing list. With PostHog, you can quickly create an in-app or email-triggered survey to capture this feedback and use it to improve retention.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating an unsubscribe survey, triggering it when users unsubscribe, and analyzing responses.

---

## Prerequisites

- A [PostHog account](https://app.posthog.com/signup) with Surveys enabled  
- Access to your app or email tool where unsubscribe events are tracked  
- (Optional) A Slack workspace or webhook integration for sending responses

---

## Step 1: Create a new survey

1. Go to **PostHog → Surveys** in the left-hand menu.  
2. Click **New survey**.  
3. Choose **Start from scratch** or pick an **Unsubscribe feedback** template if available.  
4. Give your survey a name like *Unsubscribe reasons survey*.

---

## Step 2: Add survey questions

- Add a **multiple-choice** question like:  
  *“Why are you unsubscribing?”* with options such as:  
  - Too many emails  
  - Content not relevant  
  - Switching to a competitor  
  - Other  

- (Optional) Add a **short text input** field:  
  *“Anything we could do better?”*  

Keep the survey short — 1–2 questions is usually enough.

## Step 3: Configure the trigger

1. In the **Targeting & Triggers** section, choose when the survey should appear.  
   - **In-app unsubscribe flow**: Trigger when a user clicks an unsubscribe button or reaches an “unsubscribe success” page.  
   - **Email unsubscribe link**: Use your email platform to redirect unsubscribers to a page where the PostHog survey is embedded.  

2. You can target based on events like:  
   - `$pageview` of `/unsubscribe-confirmation`  
   - Custom event `email_unsubscribed`

---

## Step 4: Publish the survey

- Save and publish your survey.  
- Test the unsubscribe flow yourself to confirm the survey appears at the right moment.  

---

## Step 5: Analyze responses

1. Go to **PostHog → Surveys → Results**.  
2. View counts for each multiple-choice option to see the most common reasons.  
3. Export responses to CSV, or connect them to:  
   - **Slack integration** (send each new response to a channel).  
   - **Webhooks** for custom workflows.  

This feedback can guide product, marketing, or support improvements.

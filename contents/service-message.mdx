<details>
  <summary>Why is ingestion paused, and for how long?</summary>
  <p>
    We're migrating the Postgres database for our US cloud to make PostHog faster, and more scalable. We can't migrate the database efficiently while it's in use, so we've temporarily paused ingestion. This is a planned event and is not related to an incident or outage.
</p>
<p>
    We started work at 09:00 UTC, May 12 and expect it to take up to four hours. If it takes longer, we'll keep this page updated with the latest information. We'll remove the in-app banner once work is finished.
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Haven't you tried to run this migration before?</summary>
  <p>
    We first tried to complete this migration on April 28, and notified users at the time. Our team ran into issues however, and we had to rollback. We're now trying to complete the work and finish the migration. Thank you for your patience! 
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What will the impact be?</summary>
  <p>
    This work will only impact users on our US Cloud, regardless of where they are in the world. Self-hosted and EU Cloud users are unaffected.
</p>
<p>
    You'll still be able to log in and use PostHog to analyze historic data as normal, but no new data will be ingested to PostHog while this maintenance is underway. Instead, we'll store data and ingest it as normal once the work is complete. Events will be delayed, but not lost.
</p>
<p>
    Feature flags and experiments will function as expected for your users, but you won't be able to make changes to them until the maintenance is complete.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Will I lose any data?</summary>
  <p>
    No. No events or data will be lost. Instead, data will be delayed during the maintenance period and become accessible once the work is complete.
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I report an issue not covered here?</summary>
  <p>
    If you're seeing a bug or other unexpected behaviour, you can <a href="http://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal" target="_blank">report it in the app</a>. Alternatively, you can <a href="/questions" target="_blank">ask us a question via the community forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you suspect an outage or incident affecting PostHog services, we recommend checking our <a href="https://status.posthog.com/" target="_blank">status page</a> before reporting.

## PostHog exists to increase the number of successful products in the world.

We provide an open source platform for product analytics. The product is new - we launched in February 2020, and have had thousands of deployments organically since we started.

This growth has meant we've been able to raise significant investment from the best in the world, such as YCombinator, and we're now ready to build our first growth team, and we need the first person on that team! You will play an instrumental role in establishing culture and in guiding how we conduct experimentation.

This role will be focused on increasing our company's most important metrics. We use Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral (AARRR) as a framework, and you'd be responsible for everything outside Retention which is the focus of our core engineering team. You'd collaborate with our marketing team on acquisition. Activation and Referral you'd collaborate with our product and design team.

Since this is the first person in this type of role, you will need product and design thinking, the ability to implement, and basic data analysis skills.

## What you'll bring:
* Breadth - we're at the big changes, not a ton of data stage. This isn't about tweaking the placement of buttons. You'll need to be able to derive insight from talking to people, your own knowledge of best practices and the limited data we have.
* You'll need to be quick. The ability to continuously design, build and test fast.
* A track record of running growth experiments, at both early stage and scale up stage companies experiencing hypergrowth.
* We don't need deep engineering skills, but you'll need to be a reasonable software engineer.
* You need to be ready to lead the function. Someone who can be a true partner and can tell us what to do. Perhaps you've been working for a VP Growth before and want to take the next step towards that role yourself.

## What we offer in return:
* Generous [compensation](/handbook/people/compensation)
* [Unlimited, permissionless vacation](/handbook/people/time-off) with a 25 day minimum
* Health insurance provided or the cost covered depending on jurisdiction
* [Generous parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off)
* Visa sponsorship if needed, for you and your loved ones
* [Training budget](/handbook/people/training)
* [$200/month budget towards coworking or caf√© working](/handbook/people/spending-money)
* Carbon offsetting for work travel with [Project Wren](https://www.wren.co/)
* [Free books](/handbook/people/training#books)

*Please note that benefits vary slightly by country. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask our team.*

## About PostHog:

PostHog's engineering culture is best-in-class, and we've had explosive user growth from this alone.

We [launched a four week old minimum viable product in February](/handbook/company/story), and since then have been deployed in thousands of places around the world.

PostHog's platform makes it easy for software teams to understand their user behavior. This coupled with our fast growth has led to a broad variety of very cool use cases. PostHog is used to help indie game designers make it more fun to defend earth from an alien threat. PostHog is used by multinational organizations running software that powers everything from banks to airlines. PostHog is used by startups disrupting their own industries.

We're a company like no other in our space. Our approach is bottoms up and that starts by being great for developers to install and use.

By being open source, we can be used on any software project throughout the world, for free, forever. Some developers will use the platform on a side project, others at their startup or small business, and others in their Fortune 500. We are building a true platform that can grow from 1 user to many no matter the size or shape of the organization.

The core of our approach is to delight end users. It's not about executive dashboards and then a terrible interface for everyone else. It's the sense of power we give to the person on the ground, doing the actual work, every day.

PostHog is building its first design team. We are looking for a proactive, fast, and passionate UX Developer to take our design to a world class level. Our product and website went viral with a basic MVP, and we're determined to be best-in-class with our UX.

The role would involve:

* Collaborating with our Designer to make sure we get a cool '80s vibe into our website and docs!
* Implementing design changes to our website, docs, and product.
* Collaborating with our Engineering team to ensure our product is simple and intuitive even to answer complex analytics queries.

The perfect candidate for this role must be as comfortable working with a designer in Figma (where our designer creates components) and working in React. It will involve a lot of rolling up sleeves and getting stuck in.

Posthog is here to increase the number of successful products that exist in the world. Right now we are focusing on helping product creators understand how people are using their product. Where things go well. Where things don't go so well.

We have built a great service for understanding how users use products. Now we need to scale it and make sure it is rock solid. You will be joining a rapidly growing team helping us support the services that allow us to absorb billions of events without loss even during crazy peaks. You will also be helping out with keeping our query engine up during high loads.
We also need to build out the infrastructure needed to deploy this stack on customer’s VPCs and equivalents so that they can maintain control over their data without any loss of quality of experience on Posthog.

Posthog is a well funded Y-Combinator and GV backed startup from the W20 batch and is growing rapidly. We love open source, data, and crafting beautiful products that are easy to use and provide clear value.

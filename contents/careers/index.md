## Why We're Here

PostHog is increasing the number of successful products in the world.

We do that by providing a platform for open-source product analytics. This helps software teams understand user behavior.

The analytics landscape has historically been very fragmented. There are many tools that provide value individually, but integrating the basic features across many verticals provides much more value.

Today, we are focused on community growth around our open source project. We aim to provide the core features of many tools, that traditionally would all sit in silos. This, coupled with the ability to use the software for free, for life, is making PostHog a no-brainer for every new software project.

We've made a crazy amount of progress to date.

We took part in [Y Combinator's](https://www.ycombinator.com/) W20 cohort, and had the most successful B2B software launch on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) since 2012, with a product that was just 4 weeks old.

Our GitHub repo has over over 3.7k stars (and growing fast), and we already have thousands of users, including deployments at large companies. 

We're backed by some of the world's top investors and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales team and regular cold calls.

What does this mean for you? We have a lot of capital, but [we're a lean, strong team](handbook/company/team) - so you've got the opportunity to have a huge impact.

## Our Culture

As a young company, our culture is still being polished by [our growing team](handbook/company/team), and, as one of our first hires, you'll play an important role in shaping it. 

A few things have already emerged as key:

##### All Remote

We are _fully remote_ and hire anywhere in the world. After all, why limit your talent pool? If you're a fit, we want you on board. 

Currently, no two PostHog members live in the same city, not even our co-founders! But don't worry, we'll still hire you even if you do share a city with a team member.

##### Diversity

Being fully remote means we're able to create a team that is _truly_ diverse.

A non-traditional team is how we build a special company. We believe diversity leads to the best results and encourage applicants from any background or experience to drop us a note. 

Learn more about [how we approach diversity](/handbook/company/diversity).

Furthermore, to ensure we can support the needs of our diverse team well, we offer unlimited time off (minimum 25 days!), don't track hours (work hard when you work), and [offer generous parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off#parental-leave) independent of gender. 

As part of our commitment to diversity, we are willing to sponsor visas for those who need them.

##### Transparency

As the builders of an open-source product, we believe it is only right that we be as transparent as possible as a company.

And this isn't just a meaningless corporate statement. Most of our communication happens publicly on GitHub, our roadmap is open for anyone to see, and this website hosts a [comprehensive handbook](/handbook) explaining anything from how we hire and pay employees to how we email investors!

We're committed to much more than just public code.

##### Written communication

We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world. With [team members across many countries](handbook/company/team), it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, pull requests, and (minimally) Slack.

Putting things in writing helps us clarify our own ideas, as well as allow others to provide better feedback. It has been key to our development and growth.

## Our Backers

We're young, but we're already [backed](/handbook/strategy/investors) by many of the best investors in the world and have [raised millions of dollars in funding](/blog/raising-3m-for-os).

This includes YCombinator, Solomon Hykes (Founder of Docker), David Cramer (Founder/CEO of Sentry), Adam Goldstein (Founder of Hipmunk), and [many more](/handbook/strategy/investors).

## Our Interview Process

The stages of our hiring process are:

**Application** - we aim to get back to you within 2 working days, but please bear with us in case it takes a bit longer. 

**[Culture interview](/handbook/people/hiring-process#interview-1---culture-with-eltje) with Eltje, our People and Talent Lead.**
  The video call is going to take 30 minutes and the goal is to ensure you will be a great cultural addition to the team and of course to answer any questions you   might have about PostHog or the role. 

**[Technical interview](/handbook/people/hiring-process#interview-2---technical)** with the [hiring team](/handbook/company/team).
  This is usually 2 PostHog team members spending 45-60 minutes with the candidate. This interview will focus on the skills needed to fill the role.
  
**[PostHog SuperDay](/handbook/people/hiring-process#posthog-superday)** - this is a *paid* day of working with us, which we will fit around your schedule. 

  Getting hired by us is extremely challenging, and this will be a big day. However, our team are going to work hard to make you successful - we want you to         succeed. You'll need to be fully engaged with a steady supply of tea, coffee, and biscuits.

  We'll set you up with a Slack support channel with several of [our core team](handbook/company/team). We'll give you a variety of tasks to work on. We are         looking for your ability to iterate, to get things live, to learn, to take initiative, and to prioritize.

  This way, you'll get a chance to see how we work, and we'll get a chance to see how you get on during the equivalent of a very busy day. And you'll be getting     paid, of course.

**Offer** Hooray! We will send you an offer letter outlining all the details of the offer and if you choose to accept, we will kickstart the onboarding process!

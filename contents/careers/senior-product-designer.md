<h5 class='centered'>PostHog empowers customers to create successful products.</h5>

We’re looking for a **Senior Product Designer** to join our small (but growing), fully-remote [team](/handbook/company/team/).

Until now, tools for building products have been very fragmented - product analytics, heatmaps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing tools weren’t natively built to work together.

PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that customers can host themselves.

### The role
We're looking for a seasoned product designer with a background in interaction design, analytics and data visualization to work on the open source PostHog web app.

This is our first dedicated product design hire, joining our [Design Lead](/handbook/company/team#cory-watilo-lead-designer) and [Graphic Designer](/handbook/company/team#lottie-coxon-graphic-designer) whose current efforts are largely focused on our website, docs and contributor experience.

You can expect to do a lot of normal product designer-y things, but with one big twist: *YOU decide what you're going to work on!* We hire high-performing individuals who can identify a problem, propose a solution, and execute on it. We ship every two weeks.

You'll work with our contributors to identify the highest leverage opportunities to improve the UX, grow retention, and assist engineers in designing new features. (Our engineers are incredibly UX-minded, so your suggestions won't fall on deaf ears!)

This role encompasses everything from building a design roadmap, user research and testing, evolving our library of Figma components, and prototyping interactions.

There's no requirement around how long you've worked in product design, though most designers in this type of role typically have 5-10 years experience.

### What you'll bring

- A design generalist, with a strong opinion about UX best practices
- A background in analytics and data visualization
- Moderate to advanced experience working in Figma
- Deep understanding of interaction design
- Ability to ship [iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration)
- A history of designing and building experience for B2B SaaS apps
- A background in front end development (This isn't a coding role - though there may be opportunities to delve into the code - but understanding how design translates into code is important.)
- Strong [communication skills](/handbook/company/culture#write-stuff-down) - most of our interaction with the team and our contributors happens on GitHub

### Nice to haves
- Interest in/experience with motion design and animation
- Familiarity with Ant Design, ChartJS, D3, and working in a React environment
- An understanding of open source software and the open source community as a whole
- Copywriting skills
- Leadership experience
- An opinion about if pineapple belongs on pizza

### What we offer in return

* Generous, transparent [compensation](/handbook/people/compensation)
* [Unlimited, permissionless vacation](/handbook/people/time-off) with a 25 day minimum
* Health insurance, including dental and vision (UK and US-based only)
* [Generous parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off)
* Visa sponsorship if needed, for you and your loved ones
* [Training budget](/handbook/people/training)
* [$200/month budget towards coworking or café working](/handbook/people/spending-money)
* Carbon offsetting for work travel with [Project Wren](https://www.wren.co/)
* [Free books](/handbook/people/training#books)

*Please note that benefits vary slightly by country. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask our team.*

### About PostHog

PostHog's engineering culture is best-in-class, and we've had explosive user growth from this alone.

We [launched a four week old minimum viable product in February 2020](/handbook/company/story), and since then have been deployed in thousands of places around the world.

PostHog's platform makes it easy for software teams to understand their user behavior. This, coupled with our fast growth, has led to a wide variety of very cool use cases. PostHog helps indie game designers make it more fun to defend earth from an alien threat. PostHog is used by multinational organizations running software that powers everything from banks to airlines. PostHog is used by startups disrupting their own industries.

We're a company like no other in our space. Our approach is bottom up, and that starts by being great for developers to install and use.

By being open source, we can be used on any software project throughout the world, for free, forever. Some developers will use the platform on a side project, others at their startup or small business, and others in their Fortune 500. We are building a true platform that can grow from 1 user to many, no matter the size or shape of the organization.

The core of our approach is to delight end users. It's not about executive dashboards and then a terrible interface for everyone else. It's the sense of power we give to the person on the ground, doing the actual work, every day.

### Our team

Our team is a combination of former CTOs and YC founders all turned developers, alongside some of the best developers from the world's largest tech companies who have the experience to help us handle scalability.

Our [team](/handbook/company/team) is tiny, but we live in 10 different countries. This diverse group looks pretty weird on paper, but it's magical. Apart from the fact most of them think [pineapple belongs on pizza](https://twitter.com/PostHogHQ/status/1319583079648923648). It doesn't.

We take bets on people with less experience too - we are as willing to hire an unproven genius straight out of school as we are a seasoned veteran.

We're all remote, and we've raised enough to pay top of market. [We are proudly backed](/handbook/strategy/investors) by some of the best VCs and Investors in the world, such as YCombinator.

<h5 class='centered'>PostHog empowers customers to create successful products.</h5>

We’re looking for a **Senior Product Designer** to join our small (but growing), fully-remote [team](/handbook/company/team/).

Until now, tools for building products have been very fragmented - product analytics, heatmaps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing tools weren’t natively built to work together.

PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that customers can host themselves.

### The role
We're looking for a seasoned product designer with a background in interaction design, analytics and data visualization to work on the open source PostHog web app.

This is our first dedicated product design hire, joining our [Design Lead](/handbook/company/team#cory-watilo-lead-designer) and [Graphic Designer](/handbook/company/team#lottie-coxon-graphic-designer) whose current efforts are largely focused on our website, docs and contributor experience.

You can expect to do a lot of normal product designer-y things, but with one big twist: *YOU decide what you're going to work on!* We hire high-performing individuals who can identify a problem, propose a solution, and execute on it. We ship every two weeks.

You'll work with our contributors to identify the highest leverage opportunities to improve the UX, grow retention, and assist engineers in designing new features. (Our engineers are incredibly UX-minded, so your suggestions won't fall on deaf ears!)

This role encompasses everything from building a design roadmap, user research and testing, evolving our library of Figma components, and prototyping interactions.

There's no requirement around how long you've worked in product design, though most designers in this type of role typically have 5-10 years experience.

### What you'll bring:

- A strong opinion about UX best practices
- A background in analytics and data visualization
- Moderate to advanced experience working in Figma
- Deep understanding of interaction design
- Ability to ship [iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration)
- A history of designing and building experience for B2B SaaS apps
- A background in front end development (This isn't a coding role - though there may be opportunities to delve into the code - but understanding how design translates into code is important.)
- Strong [communication skills](/handbook/company/culture#write-stuff-down) - most of our interaction with the team and our contributors happens on GitHub

### Nice to haves
- Interest in/experience with motion design and animation
- Familiarity with Ant Design, ChartJS, D3, and working in a React environment
- An understanding of open source software and the open source community as a whole
- Copywriting skills
- Leadership experience
- An opinion about if pineapple belongs on pizza

### What we offer in return

* Generous, transparent [compensation](/handbook/people/compensation)
* [Unlimited, permissionless vacation](/handbook/people/time-off) with a 25 day minimum
* Health insurance, including dental and vision (UK and US-based only)
* [Generous parental leave](/handbook/people/time-off)
* Visa sponsorship if needed, for you and your loved ones
* [Training budget](/handbook/people/training)
* [$200/month budget towards coworking or café working](/handbook/people/spending-money)
* Carbon offsetting for work travel with [Project Wren](https://www.wren.co/)
* [Free books](/handbook/people/training#books)

*Please note that benefits vary slightly by country. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask our team.*

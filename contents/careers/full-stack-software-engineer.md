"As soon as I have got flying to perfection, I have got a scheme about a steam engine." - [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)

PostHog exists to increase the number of successful products in the world.

## Engineering has been everything to us so far

James and Tim founded PostHog in January. They had a bunch of features they wanted to build - not sharing user data to someone else's cloud, autocapturing event data, getting access to underlying data.

It wasn't until they met [Dalton Caldwell](https://twitter.com/daltonc?lang=en) for a chat that it all clicked - *open source* would be the strategy, everything else would follow.

This means we're a product-led company. We're building a big open source community around a great, totally free, product.

The end result? Releasing new features regularly has been the *only* thing we've had to do to get to thousands of deployments.

## We release fast, it's pretty wild

We'll only win by staying fast. [Comments like this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22378393) are what we aim for.

## The people here are really, really smart

We're all remote, and we pay top of market. Combine those things with working on open source most of the time, and you have a recipe for hiring the best engineering talent in the world.

That means your team here has a combination of former CTOs and YC founders turned developers, alongside some of the best talent from the world's largest tech companies. We take bets on people with less experience too - we are as willing to hire an 18 year old genius as we are a seasoned veteran. Our team is tiny but we live in 10 different countries. This [diverse group](/handbook/company/diversity) looks [pretty weird](/handbook) on paper, but it's magical.

## We're swamped

What this means is we're getting a 
PostHog's engineering culture revolves around autonomy, speed and iteration.

As an early engineer (we currently have a team of 10 in total), you'll be key to building a lot of the core functionality of PostHog. We encourage you to take a look at our repo (issues and PRs) to see the types of things you'd be doing.

We're looking for people who are *proactive* and are *ridiculously quick* at getting new features out, while writing test and generally maintaining a clean codebase.

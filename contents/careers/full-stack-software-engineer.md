As an early engineer (we currently have a team of 10 in total), you'll be key to building a lot of the core functionality of PostHog. We encourage you to take a look at our repo (issues and PRs) to see the types of things you'd be doing.

We're looking for people who are *proactive* and are *ridiculously quick* at getting new features out, while writing test and generally maintaining a clean codebase.

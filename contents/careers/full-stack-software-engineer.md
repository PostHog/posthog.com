"Let me do it. You tell me when you want it and where you want it to land, and I'll do it backwards and tell you when to take off." - [Katherine Johnson](https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography)

PostHog exists to increase the number of successful products in the world.

## Engineering has been everything to us so far

[James](https://twitter.com/james406) and [Tim](https://twitter.com/timgl) founded PostHog in January. They had a bunch of features they wanted to build to understand their own user behavior - not sharing user data to a third party service, autocapturing events, and getting access to underlying data. Things an engineer would care about.

It wasn't until they met [Dalton Caldwell](https://twitter.com/daltonc?lang=en) for a chat that it all clicked - *open source* would be the strategy, everything else would follow.

This means PostHog is a product-led company. We're building a big open source community around a great, totally free, product.

The end result? Releasing new features regularly has been the *only* thing we've had to do to get thousands of deployments. We've raised millions of dollars from the world's best investors but we're still a small, lean team.

PostHog helps power products as diverse as those in airlines and banks, to indie gamers making it more fun to protect earth from aliens to underwear startups working on their retention!

## The release schedule is wild

We're up against billion dollar companies, and we're catching up. We will overtake them by being faster.

[Comments like this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22378393) are what we live and die by.

We keep cycles very short. There is a roadmap session, [like this](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/1870), every two weeks - each developer suggests what they want to build to have the greatest impact, then they do just that. You choose what you focus on, and you are responsible for tests, user feedback and tracking.

## The people here are really, really smart

Every day we feel lucky to have them here!

We're all remote, and we raised enough to pay top of market. Combine those things with working on open source, and you have a recipe for hiring the best engineering talent in the world.

You'd be working with a combination of former CTOs and YC founders all turned developers, alongside some of the best developers from the world's largest tech companies who have the experience to help us handle scalability.

We take bets on people with less experience too - we are as willing to hire an unproven genius straight out of school as we are a seasoned veteran.

Our team is tiny but we live in 10 different countries. This [diverse group](/handbook/company/diversity) looks [pretty weird](/handbook/company/team) on paper, but it's magical. Apart from the fact [most of them think pineapple belongs on pizza](https://twitter.com/PostHogHQ/status/1319583079648923648). It doesn't.

## Get in early

Would you have rather been in the first 20 or the last 20 people to join a [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) company? The early team we're hiring *right now* are building more than the software - they're building the way the company operates.

We need engineers who care about users, can ship quickly and thrive under a lot of autonomy. You aren't going to have a product manager dictating what you do, but you are going to need to make intelligent design and prioritization decisions with full support from the rest of the team.

## We can't do this without you

Our users do not use PostHog for the most complex querying of user data imaginable. We aren't going to use { machine learning | AI | blockchain } any time soon. 

The technical challenge here is designing a highly scalable product right out of the box when deployed on premise, supporting a wide breadth of features that give users super powers, and enabling an ecosystem of contributors and plugins from anyone in the world so PostHog becomes a true platform.

Today, PostHog meets simple use cases across a broad part of product development. That reaches from understanding retention, conversion rates, abd feature usage, to feature flags, session recordings, plugins and heatmaps.

You would be a key part in us expanding the range of functionality we are offering, or in supporting its use at scale. We'd want you to suggest ideas that you could take from concept to tests and deployment.

In particular, those with a very strong background in Django, architecture and databases (we use Clickhouse and Postgres) are going to have fun here - we have even individual clients doing hundreds of millions of events a day, but we are *truly* open to applications from any engineer that thinks they could deliver exceptional work here.

"Design is the intermediary between information and understanding." - [Hans Hofmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hofmann).

PostHog exists to increase the number of successful products in the world.

We're not just building software, our product is the company. We're building our first design team and this role is for a lead designer to shape our visual design across branding, website, documentation, social media, merch (!), and anywhere else you can see that needs attention.

Whilst this isn't a UX role, we'd expect some feedback from a visual perspective on the product itself too, for example in the aesthetics of our components.

## Ambition and engineering have taken us a really long way, so far

PostHog's engineering culture is best-in-class, and we've had explosive user growth from this alone.

We [launched a four week old minimum viable product in February](/handbook/company/story), and since then have been deployed in thousands of places around the world.

PostHog's platform makes it easy for software teams to understand their user behavior. This coupled with our fast growth has led to a broad variety of very cool use cases. PostHog is used to help indie game designers make it more fun to defend earth from an alien threat. PostHog is used by multinational organizations running software that powers everything from banks to airlines. PostHog is used by startups disrupting their own industries.

We're a company like no other in our space. Our approach is bottoms up and that starts by being great for developers to install and use.

By being open source, we can be used on any software project throughout the world, for free, forever. Some developers will use the platform on a side project, others at their startup or small business, and others in their Fortune 500. We are building a true platform that can grow from 1 user to many no matter the size or shape of the organization.

The core of our approach is to delight end users. It's not about executive dashboards and then a terrible interface for everyone else. It's the sense of power we give to the person on the ground, doing the actual work, every day.

## But, there's a catch.

We aren't on track to achieve this, as we are missing *you*.

You will be responsible for getting world class visual design into every part of our company. We'll team you up with an incredible graphic designer, and with our developer advocate, product and engineering team to create something special.

You'd be one of the very first design hires we'd make at a pivotal stage for the company, hence for the need for this to be a lead designer position.

## We hire the best to tell us what to do

We are focussed on increasing user acquisition, retention and our community growth. Design is core to all of these things.

Success in this role means we build a great brand, which filters through everything that reaches our audience of users and potential users.

This will be a challenging role - it will require the ability to execute quickly and creatively, whilst creating consistency across many assets. You will need to be strong at web layouts, understanding the developer mentality when it comes to design, and in collaborating with an all remote team to get your vision into production.

## PostHog exists to increase the number of successful products in the world

We're growing quickly and are looking for our first recruiter to help take us to the next level. While we have mainly engineers to date, we are now hiring across all areas of the business.

We also would ideally love to bring on someone who is interested in building a great culture that scales - we have worked really hard to make PostHog a great place to work, and want to maintain that as we grow.

## Ambition and engineering have taken us a really long way, so far

PostHog's engineering culture is best-in-class, and we've had explosive user growth from this alone.

We launched a [four week old minimum viable product](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/story) in February, and since then have been deployed in thousands of places around the world.

PostHog's platform makes it easy for software teams to understand their user behavior. This coupled with our fast growth has led to a broad variety of very cool use cases. PostHog is used to help indie game designers make it more fun to defend earth from an alien threat. PostHog is used by multinational organizations running software that powers everything from banks to airlines. PostHog is used by startups disrupting their own industries.

We're a company like no other in our space. Our approach is bottoms up and that starts by being great for developers to install and use.

The core of our approach is to delight end users. It's not about executive dashboards and then a terrible interface for everyone else. It's the sense of power we give to the person on the ground, doing the actual work, every day.

## We now need you to help us find more great people

We're all remote, and we've raised enough to pay top of market.

Our team is a combination of former CTOs and YC founders all turned developers, alongside some of the best developers from the world's largest tech companies who have the experience to help us handle scalability.

We take bets on people with less experience too - we are as willing to hire an unproven genius straight out of school as we are a seasoned veteran.

We're looking for a generalist recruiter to help us find extraordinary talent anywhere in the world - and fast. While we don't expect you to have necessarily recruited for every single role in a business, we have a strong preference for someone who has hired engineers. Our main challenge is hiring experienced people who are willing to get in early and build out the company with us from very early on across engineering, customer success, sales, and marketing.

## Get in early

Would you have rather been in the first 20 or the last 20 people to join a [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) company? The early team we're hiring right now are building more than the product - they're building the way the company operates.

## A bit about you

We are looking for some who:

* Has scaled a tech startup from ~10 to ~100 people in 2 years or less
* Has hired high-performing engineering teams that have shipped amazing products
* Believes deeply in diversity and optimises for that throughout the hiring process
* Is extraordinarily empathetic, rigorous and well-organised
* Has a bias for action and moving quickly, but won't compromise on quality of hire
* Will not let us make a sub-standard hire because they want to hit their recruitment targets

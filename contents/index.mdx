## Who's using PostHog?

Here are some of our paying customers. (Yes they actually use us, no it's not just some random engineer who tried us out 2+ years ago.)

When you're analyzing how customers use your product, you should be operating from _the full set of data_.

This includes customer information that happens _outside your product_:

-   payments from Stripe
-   exceptions in an error tracking tool
-   tickets in your support platform

Having all the data in one place means you can make more informed decisions about what to build next.

PostHog's Product OS isn't just analytics – it's the entire suite of tools built to give you a single source of truth about your customers.

## Usage-based pricing

<ImageMoney />

Our whole philosophy is that you shouldn't have to worry about pricing.

All our paid products are pay-per-use with generous monthly free tiers. In fact, 98% of our customers use PostHog for free.

We aim to be the cheapest option at scale – PostHog should be a no-brainer. You never have to "jump on a quick call" with sales.

Here are some examples of how we charge for most popular products:

<div id="ai">

## "Shouldn't you be talking about AI?"

We've got that too. It works across the Product OS platform – and it's _way_ more than just generating insights.

Max AI helps you automate monotonous tasks of gathering context and summarizing information – and will soon have the ability to make code changes to fix bugs and improve software.

<div id="why-posthog">

## Why PostHog?

We're different from most companies for a bunch of reasons:

-   **Transparency.** You can read our [company handbook](/handbook), our [sales manual](/handbook/growth/sales/overview), and [company strategy](/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist).
-   **We ship fast.** See our [changelog](/changelog).
-   **_Actually_-technical support.** Our [support folks](/teams/support) all have engineering backgrounds.

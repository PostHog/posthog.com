We’re delighted to announce our first ever community meet-up, where special guests from [Mention Me](https://www.mention-me.com/), one of the world's largest referral marketing platforms, will join us to discuss how they’re using PostHog to build better products and create a rich culture of experimentation.

This is also your chance to meet the PostHog team, grab some merch and share your feedback over a cocktail and slice of pizza (pineapple optional).

We look forward to seeing you there!

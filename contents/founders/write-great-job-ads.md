At PostHog, we've written job ads that have received 9,000 applicants in the last 12 months. One thing we've noticed in 2024 is that the quality of the average applicant has gone way, way up. We think this is due to a couple of things:

- We've started putting a lot more effort into making our job ads more interesting and differentiated
 
- We've stopped advertising anywhere except on our own website (of course we still pop up on a few scraper sites)

Given the number of people I've interviewed recently who have said 'I loved your job ad', we figure some of this stuff must be working! Here is a super-quick tactical guide which will hopefully help. 

## Obvious ways

These are table stakes. If you're not doing these, it's probably not even worth looking at the non-obvious stuff. Yes I am going to mention salary transparency again, like every other nano-influencer on LinkedIn.

**Really tight requirements**

Keep your list of requirements as short as possible. I like to do:

- Must have

- Nice to have

Each should be ~3-4 items long - that's it. You will know when you see a great resume anyway. Candidates don't read this stuff super carefully anyway, or will ignore the stuff they can't do (especially if they are a dude). Fun fact - you do not need to write out literally every single thing the person will be doing. 

**What the actual hiring process is**

This is nice for the candidate, but more importantly it forces _you_ to figure out how you are going to decide whether a candidate is great or not. A series of random chats with the team is not going to give you the signal you need. 

Even if you are a tiny team, you can still take 15min to figure this out and save yourself a lot of pain improvising the next step and getting stressed you haven't got back to a candidate. 

**Time zones**

All-remote doesn't necessarily mean hiring from literally anywhere. Please specify time zones before people waste a bunch of time, only to find out you don't hire in Australia. This also forces you to clarify your own thinking.

**Salary**

Stick a range in there if you really don't know. You may live somewhere this is legally mandated anyway. The point here is to avoid wasting a ton of your _own_ time getting someone through your process, only to find you are miles apart here. 

You are not that great a negotiator, and you might as well screen out the people who reeeeally care about the money first and foremost. 

## Non-obvious ways

**Get the hiring manager to write it, and then a good writer to edit it**

Classic process is hiring manager comes up with a list of bullets -> passes to recruiter to write the ad -> publish. This is a great way to ensure that you have a weird frankenstein ad written by two people, neither of whom are professional writers. 

I'm a big believer that a well-written job ad is just as important to your company as a great blog post or homepage copy. Especially if you advertise on LinkedIn, your ad will be seen by _thousands_ of people - potentially more than visit your website every week. 

Instead, do this:

- Hiring manager write the _entire_ job spec. They can copy previous ads. It is ok if they are not a great writer - they just need to write down as much as possible.
- Get a good writer to edit the ad and make it a _good piece of written content._ If your hiring manager is already a good writer, you can skip this step.
- Recruiter does a hygiene check for dumb stuff or anything obviously missing. 

**Be genuine, or even weird**

Job applicants are sometimes reading dozens of job ads in the course of their search, so cutting through the noise is really important - I'm assuming you don't already have some incredibly well-known brand like Google etc. 

Ideally, write in the tone of voice of your company. Tell a story. Your ads don't have to follow the exact same structure every time - engineers care about different things to designers. Sometimes you will want to get super specific about exactly what you want the person to do. Other times you may have a vague sense, but you need help figuring out the role - both of these are ok, but the ads should be written differently. 

I think it's actually ok to write quite a lot of content here. 'Best practice' is to make job specs as short as possible because the internet has wrecked our attention spans, but I think that just optimizes for total application volume over quality. The right candidate will spend lots of time reading and re-reading your spec because it's full of all the things they care about. 

**'Who this role is _not_ for'**

This has been incredibly helpful for us. We basically outline the kind of person we are not looking for. The point here is to screen out people who on paper might look like a great fit, but because of some specific reason, this particular role wouldn't be good for them. 

This isn't where you put 'we are not looking for lazy people who are bad at their jobs', more 'This role isn't a great fit if you are looking to eventually manage a large team' (or whatever). 

You can also do a version of this list under a 'what you'll be doing' type section - it's super helpful to make explicit what the candidate won't be doing. Again, this helps candidates to screen themselves out. As I said before, you are not that great a negotiator - if you hire someone and force them to do something they don't want to do, they will quite in 6 months anyway and you'll have to repeat this all again.

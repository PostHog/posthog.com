## About PostHog

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an all-in-one suite of product and data tools including product analytics, web analytics, session replay, heatmaps, feature flags, experiments, surveys, and more. Our mission is to equip every developer to build successful products. 

We're open source, free-to-use, and self-serve.

### What does it do?

PostHog helps developers understand how users use their product, figure out ways to improve it, and ship new features faster. It does this through features like:

- Anonymous and identified event capture, supports both autocapture and custom events
- Frontend and backend SDKs
- API for capture, flags, creating and managing metadata
- A full product analytics platform with trends, funnels, retention, SQL, and more
- A simplified web analytics dashboard with session duration, bounce rates, and channel analysis
- Session replays with event timeline, console and performance capture, and mobile recording
- Heatmaps, clickmaps, scrollmaps
- Feature flags with multivariant options, percentage and targeted rollouts, and local evaluation
- Experiments with multivariate testing
- Surveys with both no-code and API options
- A data warehouse to import and query data from external sources alongside PostHog
- Batch exports to popular warehouse destinations
- Combine events into actions, anonymous and identified users, cohorts, and groups for analysis

TLDR; All the tools you need to build a successful product.

### Does it work with my stack?

Yes. PostHog can be in a range of languages and frameworks across web, backend, and mobile. You can use it through:

- An [HTML snippet](/docs/libraries/js) that goes inside your `<head>` tags.
- One of our [15+ libraries](/docs/libraries) covering the main programming languages and frameworks
- Our [API](/docs/api)

This means that it doesn't matter what your stack is - you can use PostHog with it.

### Does PostHog support mobile apps? 

Yes. PostHog has SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, and more. All of them support event capture, feature flags, and experiments. Some also support autocapture and session replay.

### I'm having trouble setting up PostHog. What should I do?

1. Start by ensuring you have installed PostHog correctly. Try redoing whatever isn't working.
2. Check the troubleshooting page of the product you are using, such as [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting) or [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/common-questions).

### Can I self-host?

Yes, the open source version of PostHog can be deployed with Docker Compose with no event limits. This is a good option for users who want to self-host for their hobby projects but is limited due to infrastructure complexity at scale. 

See our [self-hosting docs](/docs/self-host) for more information about how to deploy PostHog's open source version.

### Will this make me better at my job?

If your job requires you to understand users and ship a product they want, then yes.

If you're a firefighter, probably not.

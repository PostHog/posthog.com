## About PostHog

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an all-in-one developer platform for building successful products. We provide [product analytics](/product-analytics), [web analytics](/web-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [error tracking](/error-tracking), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [experiments](/experiments), [surveys](/surveys), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), [data warehouse](/data-stack), [CDP](/cdp), [workflows](/workflows), [logs](/logs), and an [AI product assistant](/ai) to help debug your code, ship features faster, and keep all your usage and customer data in one stack.

PostHog is free to start with a [generous free tier](/pricing) and fully self-serve. Engineers can sign up and capture their first event in under five minutes.

### What does PostHog do?

PostHog helps developers understand how users use their product, figure out ways to improve it, and ship new features faster. It does this through features like:

- Anonymous and identified [event capture](/docs/data/events), supports both [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) and custom events
- [Frontend, backend, and mobile SDKs](/docs/libraries)
- API for capture, flags, creating and managing metadata, and querying your data
- [Product analytics](/docs/product-analytics) with trends, funnels, retention, [SQL](/docs/data-warehouse/sql), and more
- A simplified [web analytics](/docs/web-analytics) dashboard with session duration, bounce rates, web vitals, and channel analysis
- [Session replays](/docs/session-replay) with event timeline, console and performance capture, and mobile recording
- [Heatmaps](/docs/toolbar/heatmaps), clickmaps, scrollmaps
- [Feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) with multivariant options, percentage and targeted rollouts, and local evaluation
- [Experiments](/docs/experiments) with multivariate testing
- [Surveys](/docs/surveys) with both no-code and API options
- A [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) to import and query data from external sources alongside PostHog
- [Batch exports](/docs/cdp/batch-exports) to popular warehouse destinations
- Combine events into actions, anonymous and identified users, cohorts, and groups for analysis

TLDR; All the tools you need to build a successful product.

### Does PostHog work with my stack?

Yes. PostHog can be in a range of languages and frameworks across web, backend, and mobile. You can use it through:

- An [HTML snippet](/docs/libraries/js) that goes inside your `<head>` tags.
- One of our [15+ libraries](/docs/libraries) covering the main programming languages and frameworks
- Our [API](/docs/api)

This means that it doesn't matter what your stack is - you can use PostHog with it.

### Does PostHog support mobile apps? 

Yes. PostHog has SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, and more. All of them support event capture, feature flags, and experiments. Some also support autocapture and session replay.

### Is there an enterprise offering?

Yes, it includes:

- SAML SSO enforcement
- Custom MSA
- Priority training, support
- Advanced permissions
- Audit logs

Find out more on [the pricing page](/pricing) or [get in touch](/talk-to-a-human) to learn more.

### How is PostHog different from other tools?

PostHog stands apart in several key ways:

- **All-in-one platform** – Instead of stitching together separate tools for analytics, session replay, feature flags, and experimentation, PostHog provides everything in one place. This means shared data, no integration headaches, and lower total cost.
- **Built for engineers** – PostHog is designed with developers in mind. It offers SDKs in every major language, a powerful API, SQL access to raw data, and transparent documentation. Engineers can self-serve without waiting on analytics teams.
- **Open source** – PostHog's core is open source with thousands of GitHub stars. This means transparency into how the product works, the ability to contribute, and community-driven development.
- **Privacy-conscious** – PostHog offers EU-based hosting for organizations with data residency requirements, ensuring data never leaves European servers. The platform supports a fully cookieless tracking mode, eliminating the need for cookie consent banners while still capturing accurate analytics. Even in standard mode, PostHog doesn't rely on third-party cookies and offers more complete data compared to tools like Google Analytics.
- **Transparent pricing** – No hidden fees, no sales calls required, no per-seat charges. Pricing is public and usage-based.

There are many specific differences. Check out our blog for [comparisons](/posts).

## About the software

### Is PostHog updated regularly?

Yes. We release continually and have a world-class team working daily on making the product better.

Check out our [changelog](/changelog) to see what's new.

### How many companies use PostHog? Anyone famous?

We have tens of thousands of users from indie hackers to early-stage startups to high-growth scale ups to massive enterprises.

As proof, we have dozens of [customer stories](/customers), hundreds of reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), and an overwhelming amount of praise (and criticism) on social.

<p>We also have thousands of stars on GitHub (<span className="relative top-2"><StarRepoButton /></span> to be precise).</p>

### Is PostHog buggy?

While there's always room for improvement, the software works well and we use it ourselves every day.

If you have any issues or feature requests, you can [raise a ticket in-app](https://us.posthog.com/home#supportModal).

### Is this hard to set up?

No. You can [sign up](/signup), install the snippet, and capture your first event in less than five minutes.

Alternatively, the [AI wizard](/docs/ai/wizard) can handle the entire installation process for you with a single command. It automatically authenticates your account, installs the relevant SDKs, scans your codebase, and configures everything.

### I'm having trouble setting up PostHog. What should I do?

1. Start by ensuring you have installed PostHog correctly. Try redoing whatever isn't working.
2. Check the troubleshooting page of the product you are using, such as [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting) or [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/common-questions).
3. Check our [status page](https://status.posthog.com/) to see if there are any issues.
4. [Ask a question](/questions) in our community.

### Can I self-host PostHog?

PostHog's open-source version can be self-hosted, but this is not recommended. Self-hosting requires significant infrastructure expertise, ongoing maintenance, and manual updates, making it difficult to scale and keep secure. Self-hosted deployments also miss out on new features and improvements that ship continuously to PostHog Cloud.

**PostHog Cloud is the recommended option** for all teams. It offers instant setup, automatic updates, managed infrastructure, and a choice of US or EU data hosting for compliance requirements.

See our [self-hosting docs](/docs/self-host) for more information about how to deploy PostHog's open source version.

### Will this make me better at my job?

If your job requires you to understand users and ship a product they want, then yes.

If you're a firefighter, probably not.

Connect your AWS or GCP account, we’ll deploy PostHog, and manage upgrades for you. If you need to migrate data, we can help there too.

## Services offered

### App

My team tried to self-host PostHog to our AWS environment and found it… frustrating. We figured we’d build a service around our process that others can use. It's nice to not have to worry about upgrades too. 

### Pricing

$25/month

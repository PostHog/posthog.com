            Debug faster, or build context on analytics performance. Nothing beats watching people use your product for
            real.

            View recordings for users who completed a specific action or event. Watch how specific features are being

        <h5>Block sensitive data</h5>
        <p>
            Add a CSS class to any element or input field you don’t want sent to PostHog. Avoid recording private data
            and protect user privacy while still getting the data you need.

            Some user behaviour can be hard to understand. Heatmaps help you see data in the right context, so you can
            spot patterns emerging.

Spotting that with PostHog’s heatmap tool helped us know we needed to surface that link somewhere else and pushed us to put it in the main navigation. Things like that? It's why every data-driven company should be using a product like PostHog.”`}

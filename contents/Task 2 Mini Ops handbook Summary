### **I. Welcome to The Hogpatch! (Your SF Home for Building & Connection)**

At PostHog, we believe in building in public, fostering autonomy, and creating spaces where innovation thrives. The Hogpatch in San Francisco is designed to be just that: your frictionless home base for building, growing, and connecting. We want this to be a place where you feel looked after, inspired, and always ready to dive into your next big idea.

* **Our Philosophy:** This space exists to enable early-stage companies to build, grow, and hang out. My goal as your Office Manager is to ensure every operational detail is handled for you, so you can focus entirely on your mission.
* **Meet the PostHog Team:** You'll find a dedicated team here at PostHog, all working to support you. And your Office Manager (that's me!) - your go-to person for making this space awesome.
* **The Hogpatch Vibe:** Our space reflects PostHog's core values. Think transparency, a bias for action, a bit of "being weird," and a lot of ambition. We encourage a collaborative, energetic, and respectful environment for everyone.
* **Getting Started:** Quick tips for new arrivals to help you settle in and make the most of The Hogpatch.

### **II. Accessing The Hogpatch: Your Seamless Entry**

#### **Welcome, Founder! Your Seamless Entry to The Hogpatch**

We've designed The Hogpatch to be your effortless home base in San Francisco - a place where you can focus entirely on building, growing, and connecting. My role as your Office Manager is to ensure your experience here is as frictionless as possible, starting from the moment you arrive.

**How to Get In: Your Kisi App is Your Key!**

We use **getkisi.io** for secure, convenient access to the front door and garage. It's incredibly simple:

1.  **First-Time Setup:** When you're ready to get started, just **message me on Slack!** I'll get your account set up right away.
2.  **Download the Kisi App:** Once your account is active, you can download the "Kisi" app from your app store.
3.  **Unlock with a Tap:** Open the app, and you'll be able to unlock the doors with a quick tap!

**Office Manager Hours & 24/7 Access:**

* **When I'm Here to Help:** You'll typically find me on-site, ready to assist and connect, from **9 AM to 5 PM, Monday-Friday.** I'm here to be that first friendly face, answer your questions, and ensure you feel completely looked after.
* **Access Any Time:** The best part? The Hogpatch is **open for you 24/7, including weekends!** Just use your Kisi app. We trust you to be ultra-autonomous and use the space as needed for your work.
* **"Who's In From PostHog":** Don't forget to **"tap in"** using the Kisi app when you arrive! This helps our PostHog team display who's currently in the office, along with our roles. It's a great way for YC founders to see who's around and who to connect with.

**Bringing a Guest? A Quick Heads-Up Helps!**

Planning to have a guest join you for a meeting? Fantastic! Just drop me a quick Slack message beforehand. This helps me ensure they have a smooth entry and feel welcome from the moment they step into The Hogpatch.

### **III. Making The Hogpatch Yours: Navigating the Space**

This space is designed with flexibility in mind, offering different zones to suit your needs, whether you're heads-down building or collaborating with others.

* **Finding Your Focus:** We have quiet areas perfect for deep work and social zones designed for vibrant collaboration and casual conversations. Feel free to find the spot that works best for your flow.
* **Workstations:** Our desks are equipped with monitors and arms for easy setup. Need a private moment? Our phone booths are available for calls and focused work.
* **Stay Connected:** Reliable internet is the backbone of any productive startup space. You can connect to our fiber WiFi network:
    * **Network Name:** PostHog
    * **Password:** **PostHog2025!**
    For basic troubleshooting, sometimes a quick restart of your device does the trick. If issues persist, please message me, and I'll jump in to help.
* **Kitchenette & Refreshments:** We keep the kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, and a variety of snacks to fuel your day. Help yourself!
* **Restrooms:** We strive to keep our restrooms comfortable and clean for everyone.

### **IV. Behind the Scenes: Keeping The Hogpatch Running Smoothly**

#### **Seamless Operations: Your Frictionless Hogpatch Experience**

My main goal as your Office Manager is to run The Hogpatch like a well-oiled machine, entirely behind the scenes, so you can focus on what truly matters: building your incredible product. Think of it as magic. All the vendors, supplies, utilities, and maintenance are taken care of for you.

**Our Cleaning & Maintenance:**

You focus on your work; I'll handle the rest! We have dedicated cleaning services that ensure The Hogpatch is consistently sparkling clean and founder-friendly. While we encourage everyone to respect our shared space by tidying up after themselves (like putting empty cups in the dishwasher), you won't need to worry about the logistics of deep cleaning or waste management. That's my jam!

**Trash & Recycling:**
Consider it handled! All trash and recycling are managed by our services. I'll take care of ensuring bins are emptied and ready for collection on **Thursday mornings.**

**Spot an Issue? Let Me Know!**

Even the best-oiled machines sometimes have a hiccup. If you notice anything that needs attention - whether it's a hot water tap that's stopped working, an A/V system glitch, or anything else - please don't hesitate!

* **Quick Fixes:** For immediate needs (like low coffee beans or a lightbulb out), **just message me on Slack.**
* **Bigger Issues (or Safety Concerns):** For anything more significant or a safety concern, **please notify me immediately.** Your vigilance helps me fix things proactively and keep our space running perfectly for everyone.

**Our Lush Greenery:**
Our beautiful plants from Revel, a friendly local business, are regularly maintained. They add so much to the vibe! If you have any plant-related questions or notice one looking a bit sad, just let me know.

### **V. Events & Community: Making Connections at The Hogpatch**

#### **Making Waves: Host Your Event at The Hogpatch!**

The Hogpatch isn't just a place to work; it's a platform for connection, learning, and celebration. We encourage our founders and the PostHog team to use the space to host dynamic events, workshops, and product demos. Got an idea? Let's make it happen!

**Using Our Event Space:**

Our main communal area is designed to be flexible. It features:

* **Projector & Sound System:** Perfect for presentations, demos, or just a fun movie night. (Quick setup guide available on the nearby wall!)
* **Sonos Music System:** Set the mood! We have an auto-scheduled playlist, but you can manually connect via Bluetooth to override it. Just remember to be mindful of others using the space - a great ambiance is about balancing energy levels.

**Planning Your Own Event:**

Want to host a small meetup, a founder dinner, or a workshop? We're all ears!

1.  **Idea Spark:** Think about what kind of event would be genuinely useful, energizing, or insightful for the YC founder community.
2.  **Reach Out:** **Message the Office Manager (that's me!) on Slack** with your initial idea, proposed date, approximate number of attendees, and any special requirements.
3.  **Collaborate & Create:** I'll work with you to plan the logistics, check space availability, and brainstorm how to make your event uniquely "Hogpatch." We love being inventive and making things work, even without a full kitchen!

**Community Boards & Merch Wall: Share Your Story!**

* **Community Boards:** Keep an eye on our community boards for updates, upcoming events, and a place to share your ideas, challenges, or even just fun PostHog memes!
* **Merch Wall:** Grab some PostHog swag from our merch wall - wear it proud! We believe in building in public, and sometimes that means literally wearing your values.

**Upcoming Events:**

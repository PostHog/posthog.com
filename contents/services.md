PostHog is something you can deploy yourself.

However, many people want someone else to manage it for them.

If you would like any of the following, please [contact us](https://share.hsforms.com/1-IVCY9gNRvaZBajMt_UPIg4559u).

## Managed hosting in your cloud, by PostHog's team

PostHog deployed in your cloud, with our team making sure that it is set up and working properly. This tends to be the best fit for large organizations.

* No need to send your user data outside your cloud
* Full underlying access to the entire PostHog system, for easy customization or integrations with other systems
* PostHog's own team will make sure your system is kept updated and secure
* Influence our roadmap

## Community Support

There are three ways to get free support from the PostHog community:

* Ask a question directly in these Docs at the bottom of the page, or check out [our database](/questions) of previously answered questions
* Join >1,500 developers in [our public Slack group](/slack)
* Open an issue in our [main project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog)

We are very grateful for folks that do this the other way around and help answer others' questions. You may just end up with some [merch](https://merch.posthog.com/) for particularly good answers :)

## Dedicated Slack

Our preference for paid customers is to support them through a private Slack channel. This is because it helps teams realize they're on the same side - it's just more fun for everyone, which helps drive engagement.

We will select the right team for you at PostHog. This typically includes:

* _Customer Success contact_ - usually the person you first spoke to before becoming a paying customer
* _Support Hero engineer_ - we have an on call engineer between 2am PT / 9am GMT and 5pm PT / 12am GMT
* _Platform engineer_ - help with deeper infrastructure or ingestion questions for self-host customers
* _Product Manager_ - helps us to understand feature requests, or can clarify current and future feature set

[These are the kinds of people](/handbook/company/team) you'd be working with!

We do *not* have non-technical support people who triage issues. We directly connect you to people who are building PostHog. This has scaled to support thousands of companies very effectively, and we always aim to productize solutions to problems.

From your side, it's important you bring your A team. We recommend you add:

* A stakeholder from engineering
* A stakeholder from data engineering / data analysis (if self-hosting)
* A stakeholder from product management
* 2-3 power users
* A stakeholder from customer success (if relevant)
* A stakeholder from sales (if relevant)

It's best not to let your group get much bigger as it can create a lot of noise. We don't support you adding several end users of PostHog to this group - you will need to triage your own issues first.

## Dedicated email

For Enterprise customers that can't use Slack easily, we can offer priority email support instead. 

## Training sessions

We run a set number of group training sessions with your end users. We will walk them through how to make your product more successful.

These are useful at first for the initial adoption of PostHog. As you organically add more people to the platform, we can make sure everyone understands how to derive the most value.

## Configuration assistance

We help you define meaningful dashboards for your company and regularly check in that the configuration of PostHog is helping you improve your product.

We ask to be a user in your PostHog team so we can suggest ways to get more value out of the product. These are some of the ways we can help you:

* Build basic dashboards that cover Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue
* Build deep dive dashboards to help you understand changes in the above
* Give guidance on using Session Recording, Heatmaps and Paths, depending on your product
* Help you understand the impact on your core metrics of changes deployed behind Feature Flags
* Help you run Experiments 

## Terms and Conditions

PostHog Open Source is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-foss/blob/master/LICENSE).

PostHog Cloud, PostHog Scale and PostHog Enterprise have [standard terms](/terms).

### Master Services Agreement (MSA)

If you need non-standard terms or Service Level Agreements (SLAs), for example, we offer MSAs to Enterprise customers only. These cover things like:

* Bespoke pricing
* Custom Service Level Agreements
* Custom legal changes if you have special requirements
* Custom information security requirements

While we do not automatically accept all product changes and requests, we are willing to review these for our Enterprise product only. For Open Source, Cloud and Scale, we do not make contractual commitments to make product changes. 

## Security assessment

We have an extensive range of robust internal [security policies](/handbook/company/security) that apply to all products and cover several requirements around GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA and CCPA. 

For Enterprise customers, we are happy to complete your own security assessment. This can take the form of us enabling your team internally (who are responsible for information security since they are hosting the data), or it can mean us just answering questions and adapting our policies if needed.

## Bespoke pricing

We can offer bespoke pricing for Enterprise customers only.

For example, we have been asked if we can offer a set fee with a large usage cap rather than usage-based pricing, in order to make budget approval simpler. 

## Payment via invoicing

We only take payments via credit or debit card, processed via Stripe. 

For companies with invoices over $2,000/month, we are able to support manual invoicing if needed. Just email billing@posthog.com and we'll set this up.

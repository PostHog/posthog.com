Retention is a type of Insight that shows you how many users return on subsequent days after first visiting your site or product. Go to 'Insights' in the left-hand menu and select the 'Retention' tab.

## Understanding the retention table

The retention table is structured as follows:

#### Column 1: Cohort

The table starts from 11 days before the day you are viewing it, and each row is incremented by one day until "yesterday" (last row).

For [Recurring Retention](#recurring-retention), the cohort is defined by the group of distinct users that performed the event on that time period.

For [First Time Retention](#first-time-retention), the cohort is defined by the group of distinct users that performed the event _for the first time_ on that time period.

#### Column 2: Users

The number of users included in the cohort i.e. how many users visited your page on that day.

#### Remaining columns (3+)

The remaining columns are the ones displaying retention. Day 0 is the day represented under the column 'Cohort', so it will always be 100%. The following columns will show you how many of the users who visited your webpage on the day marked under 'Cohort' came back and visited _again_ on Day X.

It's easiest to explain retention using the following visual example:

![Retention table](../images/retention-table.png)

-   Looking at the row for "Sun. 12 July", 3 users visited the website on that day (Day 0).
-   Then, the next day (Day 1), 33% of those users visited **again**. In other words, one of the distinct users who visited the website on the 12th also visited on the 13th. One of those users also visited once more on Day 5 (i.e. 5 days after the 12th -> 17th).
-   Retention tracks distinct users and is a great way to see how well they are being retained. Do they come back often? Or do they just visit once? (More on this in the next section).
-   Finally, note that the retention table is filled from the bottom up, in a queue-like manner. That means cohorts are added and removed on a First In First Out basis. They are added at the bottom of the table daily, and the first row (oldest) is removed from the top.

> Users are distinct on each cohort, but not _across_ cohorts. A user from the 12th who came back on the 15th will be represented in both rows.

## Retention types

### Recurring retention

Recurring Retention counts a user as part of a cohort if they performed the cohortizing event on that time period, irrespective of it was their first time or not.

### First time retention

Rirst time retention cohortizes users based on when they did an event for the first time, rather than adding a user to each cohort they had the event in.

## Retention events

### Cohortizing event vs. retaining event

The _cohortizing event_ is the event that determines if the user is a part of a cohort or not (i.e. adds the user to the first column). The _retaining event_, on the other hand, is the event retention is being calculated on (i.e. adds the user as a data point to one of the "percentage boxes").

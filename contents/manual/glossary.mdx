PostHog is an incredibly broad platform, with many distinct features and tools. As a result, it's hugely powerful -- but can be overwhelming if you're new to product analytics. So, we've created a glossary to explain many of the most common terms and acronyms. If a term is specific to PostHog then it's marked with a [hedgehog](/manual/glossary#hedgehog) ðŸ¦” to help reduce confusion.

## A

#### Action ðŸ¦”
Actions in PostHog are a way to organize [events](/manual/glossary#event) into a different format. In their simplest form actions consist of one or more events which have been given a new name - usually a descriptive title, such as 'Viewed Glossary Page`. [Find out more about actions in PostHog](/manual/actions). 

#### Active user
Active users are the people who currently use your product. A user who becomes inactive may have [churned](/manual/glossary#churn).

#### Alias ðŸ¦”
A related user account. In PostHog, aliases can be used to connect two user accounts (and their data). For example, combining the data of an anonymous user with their signed up account. See more in [identifying users](/docs/integrate/identifying-users).

#### Annotation ðŸ¦”
Annotations are short text notes you can apply to your data to help you understand context at a later point, or to signal important context to others. A common use for annotations it to add them shared charts and mark important events, such as feature releases or new marketing activiity. [Find out more about annotations in PostHog](/manual/annotations). 

#### App ðŸ¦”
Apps are additional features or functionality built on top of PostHog. They are commonly used to integrate PostHog with other platforms, modify events or enhance PostHog's functionality. Apps may be built by the PostHog team, or by the community. You can [browse the app library](/apps) to see what's available, or [find out more in the docs](/docs/apps). Formerly known as plugins. 

#### App chain ðŸ¦”
In PostHog, the output of one app can impact the actions of the next app to create a chain. This makes it crucial to understand the order in which apps run. [Find out more about app chains in the docs](/docs/apps/build). 

#### ARR
Annual recurring revenue - basically how much revenue you expect to make each year.

#### Autocapture
The ability to capture user behavior (events, pageviews) automatically, without having to implement dedicated instrumentation. PostHog enables you to autocapture data by using out [JavaScript library or snippet](/docs/integrate/client/js#autocapture).

#### A/B test
A/B tests are when you test two versions of an idea by serving each version to portion of your userbase, so you can monitor which performs best. If you're using more than two versions, it's a [multivariate test](/manual/glossary#multivariate-test). PostHog can do both, via [Experiments](/manual/experimentation). 

## B 

#### B2B

Cohorts are groups of users in PostHog, created using the Cohorts tool. Cohorts can be created as either a static list, or a dynamic list which continues to update. Cohorts and [groups](/manual/glossary#groups) are similar, but [not the same](/manual/group-analytics#groups-vs-cohorts).

#### Contributor ðŸ¦”
As an [open source](/manual/glossary#open-source) company, PostHog enables anyone to add to our codebase or to submit ideas, either as [issues](/manual/glossary#issue) or [PRs](/manual/glossary#pull-request). When someone does this, they become a contributor and can earn rewards such as [merch](https://merch.posthog.com/collections/all), invitations and public thank yous. Sometimes, they even [get hired](/careers). We love our contributors - [check them out](/handbook/company/team#contributors)!

#### Conversion
Conversion is when a user of your product changes into a new, usually more desirable, state. For example, converting from a lead into an [active user](/manual/glossary#active-user). You can use tools such as [funnels](/manual/funnels) to track users who convert between states.

This makes it easier to collaborate, as you can share dashboards with others in many different ways. [Find out more about Dashboards in the docs](/manual/dashboards).  

#### Data lake
A data lake is a system for storing raw data. The data stored in a data lake is usually for an ambiguous or unknown purpose, but the style of storage means all data is easily accessible to seasoned professionals and can be quickly updated.  

#### Data warehouse
A data warehouse is a system for storing processed data. The data that's stored in a data warehouse is usually for a specific, known purpose and is in constant use. As a result, the data is highly accessible but it can be slow and costly to make infrastructure changes.

#### DAU 
Daily Active Users. Basically, how many [active users](/manual/glossary#active-users) you have each day. [You can track this in PostHog using a simple trends chart.](/manual/trends)

#### Event ðŸ¦”
Events are the core building block of PostHog. Any activity a user does, such as clicking a button or viewing a page, is an event. Events are [ingested](/manual/glossary#ingestion) into PostHog, and sometimes organized as [actions](/manual/glossary#actions).

## F 

#### Feature flag
Feature flags are used to divide users into two groups - those for whom the flag is enabled, and those for whom the flag is disabled. Based on this flag status, users are served a version of the product where a specific feature is, or isn't, available. [Find out more about feature flags in the docs](/manual/feature-flags). 

#### First-party cookies
Every time you visit a website or view content from a website, you are served a `cookie` - a data packet which contains information on your visit. First-party cookies are those which are served by the website operator and are typically used to store only user preferences. Users who self-host PostHog are able to collect additional information through their first-party cookie because PostHog is also deployed onto their servers. See also: [third-party cookies](/manual/glossary#third-party-cookies)

#### Formula ðŸ¦”
An equation or calculation that modifies data from one or more series. 

#### FOSS
Free Open Source Software. FOSS products are exactly as they are described: free, and open source. [PostHog has a FOSS version too!](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-foss)

#### Funnel 
A funnel is a concept used to track users through a series of actions, such as from pageview to registration and login. In PostHog, you can use [the funnel insight](/manual/funnels) to track how many users move through each stage, and where drop-offs occur. 

## G

#### GDPR

#### Groups 
Groups in PostHog enable you to aggregate events by anything other than an individual user, such as a company, team, device, project or pricing tier. [Groups are different to cohorts](/manual/group-analytics#groups-vs-cohorts) and can be used for [group analytics](/manual/group-analytics).

#### GTM
Go-to Market. In short, it's the plan you have for how you will bring a new product or feature to market, often building in intelligence on your users gained from product analytics. 

## H

#### Heatmap ðŸ¦”
Heatmaps enable you to visualize user activity as an overlay on top of the page, with warmer colours used to represent where the most activity takes place. In PostHog, heatmaps are used to track where users click. Find out more about PostHog heatmaps](/manual/toolbar), which are enabled via the [toolbar](/manual/glossary#toolbar). 

#### Hedgehog
Incredibly cute creatures which are sadly becoming increasingly rare around the world. Hedgehogs are recognisable for their prickly backs, dislike of badgers and [ever-changing fashion habits](/blog/drawing-hedgehogs).

## K

#### K Factor
A metric for understanding the virality of your product. You can calculate your K factor by figuring out the number of invitations or recommendations about your product which users make, then multiplying it by the success rate of those invitations or recommendations. Any result greater than 1 indicates viral growth, as every user you acquire will, on average, successfully invite another.

#### North star
A single metric or objective which guides your decision making. Find out more about [how to set north stars and why they matter](/blog/north-star-metrics).

#### NPS 
Net Promoter Score. A metric for understanding customer satisfaction and loyalty, based on asking users how likely they are to recommend your product, on a scale of 0 (not likely) to 10 (certainly likely). Users are then grouped into buckets based on their score - those who score 9-10 are labelled as Promoters, while those who score 0 to 6 are labelled as Detractors. Everyone else is labelled as Passive. By subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters, you determine an NPS score between -100 (very poor) and +100 (excellent).

## O

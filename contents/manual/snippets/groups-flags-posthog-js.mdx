If you have updated tracking, you can use group-based feature flags as normal in [posthog-js](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/client/js).

```js
if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature')) {
    // do something
}
```

To check flag status for a different group, first switch the active group via a `posthog.group()` call.

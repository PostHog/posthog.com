Groups are how you track and perform analysis on the aggregation of an something other than a user.
You can perform any type of analytics (e.g. Trends, Funnels, Retention, etc.) based on groups rather than users (e.g. Number of companies who signed up in the last 28 days, Number of total transactions in the past 14 days, etc.)

Groups can be used in almost the exact same manner as users:
- You can use groups to roll-out your feature flags more consistently. Instead of giving users in the same organization a different experience, roll out the feature flag to whole organizations.

Group analytics is a premium feature that requires an additional subscription.

-   If you're self-hosting PostHog, Group Analytics is available on the Scale & Enterprise plans. [Get a license now](https://license.posthog.com?utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=group-analytics-docs-license)

## Understanding group analytics

With groups, there's two important concepts to remember. These are Groups and Group Types.

## Groups vs Group Types

The simplest example of a group type is a company, users from multiple companies that might use your product - groups allows you do to analytics on these - e.g. Daily Active Companies.

The group types determine what kind of groups you have. For example, a `company` is a group type. A `transaction` is a group type. There's a hard limit of 5 group types you can create, so think carefully about what group types you want.

A group is a specific instance of a group type. For example, if `company` is a group type, then `PostHog`, `Tesla`, `IBM`, `SpaceX` are the groups. You can have unlimited groups.

As another example, if `transaction` is a group type, then each `transactionID` is a group.

## Getting started

### Defining groups

> **Note:** You must include at least one group property for a group to be visible in the "Persons & Groups" tab

Groups are at the event level. If everything is setup correctly, then events that come into PostHog have a group associated with them, which is determined by you. See below for how to set this up.

Thus, there's no new events corresponding to groups: it's simply the events that already exist, aggregated by group values.

A popular misconception is that groups are defined per user. This might make sense if the group type is a company, since a company is a set of users, but it quickly breaks down when you're looking at a transaction group type: here a user can do multiple transactions. Thus, remember that groups are defined on events.

If users belong to multiple companies, e.g. internal staff members accessing multiple company accounts. We assume that the user was part of that company for the duration of that event and not that the user was part of two companies at the same time.

Another important concept to remember here is that a single event belongs to only a single group per group type. For example, say you have a `transaction occured` event. And you have 3 group types: `transaction`, `company`, `pineapple_type`.

Then, this event can belong to at most one group per group type. So, for this event, you can have `transaction = 123456789`, `company = PostHog`, `pineapple_type = British`.

**Warning:** You can't have something like: `transaction = [123456789, 12345678910]`. This is not possible.

You can skip some groups if they don't make sense. For example, `transaction = 123456789`, `company = PostHog`, and no `pineapple_type` is valid as well.

The following examples use `company` as a group type and `id:5` as the group key. Replace these with your particular values.

> **Tip:** Use a singular form of the group type throughout ingestion

<MultiLanguage>

```js
posthog.group('company', 'id:5');

// 'some event' will now be attributed to the company with id=5
posthog.capture('some event')
```

```python
# Capturing an event with groups
posthog.capture('[distinct id]', 'some event', groups={'company': 'id:5'})
```

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
    DistinctId: "[distinct id]",
    Event:      "some event",
    Groups: posthog.NewGroups().
        Set("company", "id:5").
})
```

```node
posthog.capture({
    event: "some event",
    distinctId: '[distinct id]',
    groups: { company: 'id:5' }
})
```

```php
PostHog::capture(array(
    'distinctId' => '[distinct id]',
    'event' => 'some event',
    '$groups' => array("company" => "id:5")
));
```

```segment
// Capturing an event with groups
analytics.track('[event name]', {
    "$groups": {
        "company": "id:5"
    }
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

### Setting and updating group properties

Every group can have properties associated with it. For example, if you have the `company` group, you could have properties defined on this group, like `company_name`, `revenue`, `user_count`, etc. etc.

As another example, the `transactionID 12345679` group of `transaction` group type can have properties like `transaction_value`, `transaction_method`, etc. associated with them.

These properties can be used in insights similar to how you use person properties.

<MultiLanguage>

```js
posthog.group('company', 'id:5', {
    employees: 560,
    plan: 'enterprise',
});
```

```python
posthog.group_identify('company', 'id:5', {
    'company_name': 'Awesome Inc',
    'employees': 11
})
```

```go
client.Enqueue(posthog.GroupIdentify{
    Type: "company",
    Key:  "id:5",
    Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
        Set("company_name", "Awesome Inc").
        Set("employees", 11),
})
```

```node
posthog.groupIdentify({
    groupType: 'company',
    groupKey: 'id:5',
    properties: {
        company_name: 'Awesome Inc',
        employees: 11
    }
})
```

```php
PostHog::groupIdentify(array(
    'groupType' => 'company',
    'groupKey' => 'id:5',
    'properties' => array("company_name" => "Awesome Inc", "employees" => 11)
));
```

```segment
analytics.track('$groupidentify', {
    "$group_type": "company",
    "$group_key": "id:5",
    "$group_set": {
        "company_name": "Awesome Inc",
        "employees": 11
    }
})
```

</MultiLanguage>

### Naming groups

The PostHog UI identifies a group using the `name` property. If no `name` property is found, it falls back to the group key.

So, if you call `posthog.group` as below:

```js
posthog.group('the_example_group', 'group-uuid', {
    uuid: 'some-random-uuid',
    company_name: 'the company_name property',
})
```

The UI will have a `the_example_group` tab and a group showing up as 'group-uuid'.

If instead you call

```js
posthog.group('the_example_group', 'group-uuid', {
    uuid: 'some-random-uuid',
    name: 'the name property',
    company_name: 'the company_name property',
})
```

Then the group will show up as `the name property` instead of `group-uuid`.

### Using groups in PostHog

#### Viewing groups and their properties

To view groups and their properties, head to the "Persons and Groups" tab on the navigation bar.

From here you can select the group type you are interested in and view the groups and properties (by clicking the chevrons on the left).

![View Groups](../images/docs/user-guides/funnels/view-groups.png)

#### Groups vs cohorts

Groups differ from cohorts, a cohort is a essentially a list of users. Whereas a groups represent every entity of a certain type.

Following the company example again, you can have a cohort of users which belong to a certain company (e.g. Company A). But you could create a group type of "companies" which represents all companies and their users.

#### Analysing group insights

Once you have integrated tracking for groups this will unlock the ability to analyze based on them.
Using groups in insights works in almost the exact same way as with users, and works by aggregating events and properties based on unique groups.

The groups determine what your insights aggregate on. For example, consider the funnel with two events: `User signed up -> User activated`

Traditionally, you'd only have unique users in the funnel: Users from any and every company who're using your product and doing something important. Your conversion rate is per user. But what if you're interested in looking at this conversion rate across companies? Say, you're a B2B product and doing something important once per company is good enough. Then the funnel you want to track is `User signed up -> User activated` aggregated by unique companies, not users.

That's a group aggregation over the company group type. It's the same events, aggregated differently.

What if you wanted to breakdown this funnel by company name? Maybe there's specific companies that never converted, and you want to follow up with them to see what's going wrong. Like mentioned above, if you have group properties defined, you can breakdown by `company_name`.

#### Renaming group types

You can change how group types are displayed in your Insights interface and throughout PostHog on Project settings.

### Organizations signed up in last week

If we wanted to see how many organizations signed up in the last week we can create a trends insight and set the event to be our sign up event and the "counted by" "unique organization(s)", you should see all of your group types here.

This will show us the trend of sign ups by organization as opposed to per user.

![View Groups](../images/docs/user-guides/funnels/signed-up-organizations.png)

### Organization signup funnel

You can use groups in many insights, for example in a funnel you may want to understand how an organization moves from their first visit to signing up. You can set the "aggregating by" to be the group type you wish to aggregate by.

This will show how many organizations have made it through the funnel as opposed to individual users.

![View Groups](../images/docs/user-guides/funnels/funnels-group-aggregation.png)

## Integrating groups with feature flags

Similar to insights, where you're aggregating events by group type, you can have Feature Flags that work on groups. This allows you to rollout a feature by company, instead of users. Preventing disruption when two users at the same company see a different experience.

You can use feature flags as you normally would, except you need to select the group type you wish to "Match by", using the drop down by release conditions.

You will also need to update your event tracking code (covered below), for the feature flag to be able to determine the groups of the current user.

<MultiLanguage>

```js
if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature')) {
    // do something
}
```

```python
if posthog.feature_enabled("new-groups-feature", "[distinct id]", groups={"company": "id:5"}):
    # do something
```

```php
if (PostHog::isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature', '[distinct id]', false, array("company" => "id:5"))) {
    // Do something
}
```

```node
const isFlagEnabled = await posthog.isFeatureEnabled('new-groups-feature', '[distinct id]', false, { company: 'id:5' })

if (isFlagEnabled) {
    // Toggle feature-flag specific behavior
}
```

</MultiLanguage>

## Limitations

-   A maximum of 5 group types can be created per project
-   Multiple groups of the same type cannot assigned to a single event (e.g. Company A & Company B)
-   Groups are not currently supported for the following insights:
    -   Lifecycle - Expected soon
    -   User Paths - These only support user level analytics
-   Only groups with known properties are shown under 'Persons & groups'
-   Groups cannot be directly deleted

Insights allow you to visualize your Events and Actions in several different ways. Each type of Insight has its own manual in these Docs:

-   [Trends](/docs/user-guides/trends)
-   [Funnels](/docs/user-guides/funnels)
-   [Retention](/docs/user-guides/retention)
-   [Paths](/docs/user-guides/paths)
-   [Lifecycle](/docs/user-guides/lifecycle)

## Creating Insights

To create a new Insight, click on `+` next to Insights in the left hand sidebar. You can also click on 'Insights' itself to view and search through your current list of Insights.

You can then create [Dashboards](/docs/user-guides/dashboards) to collect and present multiple Insights in one place.

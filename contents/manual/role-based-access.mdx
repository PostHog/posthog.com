PostHog gives you tools for feature access control and team member groupings with role based access inside of PostHog.

## Organizational defaults

By default, team members in your organization have view and edit access to all resource features (feature flags, experiments, session recordings).

These can be changed under organization settings -> role based access tab. You can set organizational defaults to just "view only" and restrict edit access to certain features.

## Roles

Roles are groupings of team members. You can assign a member to multiple roles. 
For more granularity, you can also define the amount of feature access each role has. 

Only organization members with admin+ access level can create or edit roles.

## Resources

Resources are PostHog features. These include but are not limited to feature flags, experiments, session recordings, and cohorts.

Members will always be able to view resources, create new resources, and edit their own existing ones. Access control restricts editing for resources that are not created by you.

## Custom edit access per resource

For even more granularity, you may set only certain individual resources to be editable by certain roles. You can set these on the resource itself.

As an example, I have feature flags A and B and roles A and B, and I want each role to only be able to edit their corresponding flags.
The organization default for feature flags edit access should be "view only" and each role should not have feature flags edit access either.
I would then go into feature flag A, and under the permissions tab for that feature flag, add "role A" to the custom permissions for it.

> **Note:** Roles based access is an enterprise offering. To use this feature, [the enterprise package should be added on.](/pricing).

> Each month, we speak to a team enrolled in PostHog for Startups about the way they work. This time, we spoke to [Puzzle](https://puzzle.io/), an accountancy platform for early-stage startups, about how they define and use their Ideal Customer Persona (ICP). 

Building an Ideal Customer Persona (sometimes known as an Ideal Buyer Profile) is one of the most challenging but essential steps for growing your product. Not only will it help you make product and pricing decisions, it will also clarify your value proposition and dictate how you judge successes and failures.

We’ve previously documented [how we defined our ICP](/founders/creating-ideal-customer-profile), but not all companies approach the task in the same way. So, we spoke to the team at [Puzzle](https://puzzle.io/) about how they defined their ICP, what impact the definition had, and what recommendations they had for others...

## 1. Collect both qualitative and quantitative data

An ICP is, fundamentally, a snapshot of your ideal customer based on a gestalt of many customers. In order to define your ICP you therefore need to start by speaking to your existing users directly and building an intuitive understanding of their needs.

Once you’ve done that, says Scott, you need to pair that intuitive understanding with quantitative data, so you can understand if these behaviors exist in isolation or at scale. 

“We’re constantly standing next to founders who are just starting out and I do a healthy amount of interviews,” says Scott. “But it’s one thing for a customer to say they want, need, or plan to do X, Y, or Z — and another thing if they actually do it. That’s where quantitative data is useful. You need both to create your ICP.”

> **Putting it into practice:** It can help to [define a small number of reference customers](/founders/creating-ideal-customer-profile#5-reference-customers). Spend time with them to gather subjective data, while using a tool such as [PostHog](/startups) to collect hard facts.

## 2. Understand how your users _feel_

Armed with this qualitative and quantitative data, you can start to establish your value proposition.

For Puzzle, this was critical for differentiating them from other products in the market. Every company needs an accounting platform, but not all founders feel the same about this need — and by focusing on users’ unaddressed needs Puzzle can identify a strong, unique position for the product.

“Founders don’t sign up to Puzzle because they just can’t wait to do their accounting,” says Scott. “They sign up because they know they need to be tax compliant and to be ready for investor reporting... We learned that they care about efficiency, accuracy and, as they generate more revenue, delaying hires in the finance department.”

All of this is reflected in Puzzle’s online messaging, with language which directly addresses founders ahead of accountants and emphasizes how the product integrates simply with other tools which founders already use. 

> **Putting it into practice:** [We advise having an approximate structure for user interviews](/blog/how-to-work-out-what-users-need), but leave room to flex. If users go off on a tangent during an interview that could give you vital [insights to their actual feelings](/handbook/product/user-feedback)!

## 3. Build pricing around user segments

Next, you can delve into the quantitative data by looking at how users can be segmented into different groups based on criteria such as size or industry. Puzzle used this information to structure its pricing model, for example. 

“On [our pricing page](https://puzzle.io/pricing) we make this pretty clear,” says Scott. “We have a plan for formation-stage founders, a plan for startups who have raised a little funding, and a scale plan for companies which are generating revenue.

Each plan also reflects the pain points a user would deal with at that stage too and addresses it with a product feature. Monthly compliance checklists in the free plan, for example, help formation-stage founders get started quickly — but give way in the scale-up plan to AI automation and new processes.

> **Putting it into practice:** If you aren’t using tiered pricing plans then it can still be helpful to think of your broader [pricing principles](/handbook/engineering/feature-pricing). Ask yourself: how do these principles work for your different user segments? 

## 4. Reinforce your ICP with internal teams

As you grow, it’s important not to drift from your ICP or to let teams’ understanding of it become corrupted. You need to constantly remind everyone in your company who you are building for and how your product meets their needs — otherwise you risk diluting your offering. 

“When I joined Puzzle I was very happy to hear people talking about our ICP,” says Scott. “Then I saw there was some confusion and some of what was said was incorrect. Some people thought our ICP is a company, while others thought it was a person, and there were some different ideas floating around.”

At PostHog, we’ve solved this issue with [a public handbook](/handbook) which documents [our ICP](/handbook/who-we-are-building-for) — but Puzzle took a different approach.  

“We have these all-hands meetings where everybody has to put their hand up and swear that our ICP is a founder and not an accountant,” says Scott. 

> **Putting it into practice:** There are lots of ways to disseminate information internally, from intranets to incorporating it into employee onboarding. Whichever route you take though, the key is consistency. 

## 5. Once you start, don’t stop

Once you’ve established your ICP you must constantly maintain it. You need to always be speaking to users, working to understand their concerns, and analyzing the data behind their usage. In doing so you can find new segments to target, new needs to address, and new product improvements to make.

“We started looking at our biggest user drop-offs and found many ICP users were dropping off when they had to connect their bank,” says Scott. “We reached out to these users directly and talked to them. We had to try and understand their concerns.”

Scott’s team learned that customers were becoming frustrated by delays during this connection step. As a result they improved the content on the page, added new loading animations, and surfacing data more quickly — an ICP-informed change which had an immediate impact on overall activation. 

> **Putting it into practice:** Data gathering and user interviews should be on-going processes for many teams. Otherwise how else can you know if [your new interface design](/blog/introducing-notebooks) is a good idea, or if your upcoming changes will be well received?

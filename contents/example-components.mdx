        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>
            Keeping data on your existing infrastructure means you never have to send user data to third parties,
            minimising the risk of breaches.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Control</h4>
        <p>
            Self-hosting means you control everything, from when to deploy updates to where the servers are physically
            located.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>
            With self-hosting there’s no need for lengthy compliance or security audits. Just use your existing
            infrastructure instead.

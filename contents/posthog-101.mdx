# WTPostHog?!

#### **tl;dr:** If you're building anything online, PostHog helps you make it better.

We’ve all used websites and apps that are really <strong class="text-red">frustrating to use</strong> – buggy, confusing, or slow.

<ImageHogDashboards />

And we’ve all used products that just seem to <strong class="text-green">work exactly how you’d expect</strong> – _the ones that feel “sticky” from the moment you sign up._


Well-built products don’t often manifest that perception on their own – the people behind those products rely on a bunch of tools that help them:

- understand what their users are doing
- diagnose issues they’re facing
- test changes to improve the product

_... and they continuously repeat this cycle._

PostHog offers just that: **a suite of tools to help product builders build products people love.**

Until PostHog, you'd have to buy products from a bunch of different companies to get all of these tools. But with PostHog, it's all in one.

Skip to: [What you can do with PostHog](#what-can-you-do-with-posthog) →

<hr />

## An analogy of a retail boutique

<ImageRetailHogs />

If you ran a small clothing store. It's your job to organize merchandise and help customers. You'd likely be doing some combination of the following:

- Observing customers as they walk in – how they dress, who they’re with, if they’re shopping with intent or casually browsing
- Asking customers what they’re looking for (size, color, style)
- Proactive helping them find something that meets their needs
- Listening for feedback about the store, products, or their experience – whether they say it directly to you or not
- Moving merchandise around to highlight new products or to try to increase visibility of high margin products or best sellers
- Improving the environment: playing different kinds of music, tidying up, or adjusting the temperature to make sure guests are comfortable

### Okay, but what does this have to do with PostHog??

Running an app or web product is like working in a physical store – except without any of the benefits of being in the same room as your customers. You can’t:

- observe the mannerisms of the person and pick up on their non-verbal cues
- rely on your judgement to say just the right thing in the perfect moment – whether that’s to answer a product question or save them from walking out the front door
- really understand why people did or didn’t do something (like buy a product, complete a checkout, or upgrade their account), just from looking at numbers or graphs

Quantitative data is valuable, but without also overlaying the qualitative, you’re limited in the conclusions you can make and the takeaways you should glean from them. And if you’re making decisions from siloed data (like *just* daily sales numbers from a point of sale system), you’re likely missing context that would enrich your decision making.

PostHog bridges the gap between you and the person on the other end of a computer screen – at scale – by wading through tons of data points to help you make more informed decisions. And because not everyone is a data scientist, you can rely on PostHog AI to help make sense of it all.

<hr />

## What can you do with PostHog?

After installing a small snippet of code (just like Google Analytics), you can do things like:


### Watch screen recordings of people using your product, app, or website

<ImageReplayHog />

It's like watching someone use your website over their shoulder. You can see exactly where they get confused or stuck.

It's also helpful in debugging issues they report that you can't reproduce. It's leaps and bounds more useful than trying to sift through logs – and more accurate than asking for feedback.

Support teams love using Session Replay to pinpoint exactly what users are talking about – especially in vague support tickets!

### Build graphs, dashboards, and funnels

It's way easier than in GA *and* more useful because you can drill into activity of a specific user. (GA can't do this because it only tracks visitors anonymously.)

Explore: <ProductButtonProductAnalytics />

### Roll out a new feature to a limited group of users

This helps make sure you've worked out the bugs with a friendly group before releasing it to the world. You can also pair it with Experiments to get statically-significant results at scale.

Explore: <ProductButtonFeatureFlags /> <ProductButtonExperiments />

### Analyze product usage behavior with other data sources

If you have a CRM, a payment processor, or a data warehouse, you're generating data in other services. It's far more valuable to analyze your product usage when you also have this information available, too. And if you know SQL, you can run queries that leverage this rich dataset.

Explore: <ProductButtonDataWarehouse />

### Ask questions when users do (or don't do) something

Being able to ask specific users (or groups) a question or something like an NPS survey when they complete (or fail to complete) a task helps provide context about what they're actually thinking in that moment.

Explore: <ProductButtonSurveys /> 

### Do everything above – _with AI_

Set up most of the above and analyze all your data with PostHog AI. You can ask open-ended questions and it'll do the research for you. It can also help write SQL queries so you can ask a question without knowing the technical ins and outs of your data model.

Explore: <ProductButtonAI />

## Why not Google Analytics?

<ImageChartHog />

Traditionally we’ve all used Google Analytics to understand usage, but it’s not the right tool for the job. GA lets you see charts and graphs but doesn’t offer the ability to drill in to what each *individual* customer is doing.

With PostHog, you can see charts and graphs in aggregate (like GA), but also go so much deeper. And here, you can import all your customer data that’s generated across dozens of tools. This means that with AI, we’re building a world where you can get answers to questions you don’t even have to ask – because AI will be doing the hard work for you.

<hr />

## Point is...

If you have a website, or run a web app or mobile app and you want to make it better, stick with PostHog. We're building everything you'll need to understand your users, fix bugs, ship changes – and most importantly – make you more successful.

We have a generous free tier for each product (and it resets monthly). We try to treat you like we'd want to be treated, and we want PostHog to be the platform you stick with forever.

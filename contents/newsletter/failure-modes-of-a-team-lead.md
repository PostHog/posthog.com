<intro>

maybe bits on how this is intented for anyone who leads eng teams (ICs) and not just managers

## 1. You became the bottleneck/gatekeeper (alt: You slow your team down, not speed them up)

Bits on hoarding context and acting like the teams gatekeeper/router. Bring the context to your team

Maybe some overlap from the PM newsletter section 1 on not controlling engineers - https://posthog.com/newsletter/product-management-is-broken#1-pms-dont-control-engineers

Dont try become the sole point of communication between your team and others. Instead, connect the right people together directly.

Dont be be the only person on your team who talks to customers. Instead, encourage everyone to do this - this starts at onboarding!

Tell-tale sign is that you're the final decision maker / everyone looks to much to your for guidance 
Acting like a manager or sole decision-maker is a red flag.
Best ideas often come from all team members, not just the lead.
A lead being the bottleneck or central figure can slow down progress.

## 2. You stopped writing code

Coding should still be ~80-90% of your time. Leadership is an overlay, not a new job description. Your job isnt to run meetings and manage sprints

Prioritize shipping and impact over unnecessary meta-work. (maybe this is a separate point)

## 3. You focus on made up metrics

You forget about the _real_ goal

The real goal isnt activation rates, sign up rates, funnels, etc. Its revenue (and usage and quality?)

Success looks like usages from real users who are actually getting value from your product
 
maybe Something on the cause being you dont lean into understanding your product and what you're building enough. Not engaging deeply with the product: A lead must genuinely understand and care about the product. Without that, it's easy to lose focus or chase abstract, low-impact problems.

Your goal is a team lead is to align your team as much as possible on these goals

Maybe a bit on not focusing on fancy architecture and how every decision you make should be aligned with improving your users value. E.g. increasing your code speed 10% is not something they would notice.

## 4. You're scared of changing goals

Something on how you plan your roadmmap in advance, but never question it until the end of the quarter/half/year. Ultimately your product's success is your responsibility/the buck stops with you, so its up to you to ensure your team is providing value

Instead, use growth reviews for this (can reuse bits from PM newsletter - https://posthog.com/newsletter/product-management-is-broken#4-accountability-through-feedback-loops)

## 5. You don't keep the talent bar high 

Bits on using the [Keeper Test](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/management#the-keeper-test)

Giving regular, hard feedback 

## 6. You try to do it all yourself

you're responsible for the performance of the team and making sure things are getting, not necessarily doing it all yourself

David's failure mode on not reaching out for a PM/ Was hard to dig into onboarding and activation metrics but didnt have time to dig into the data and why (speaking to customers etc), ultimately affecting growth of the product.

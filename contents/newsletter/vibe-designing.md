Subheading for email: Engineers Move Fast. Your Design Should, Too.

## Intro: 

LLMs have supercharged the speed at which engineers ship code. But great products aren‚Äôt just built on shipping velocity‚Äîthey‚Äôre built on experience. And experience is where design comes in.

Historically, engineers relied on product designers to make things feel right. Now, with tools like ChatGPT, v0.dev, and Lovable, you can go from idea to production-ready interface‚Äîwithout waiting on a Figma file.

This newsletter is your shortcut to becoming a ‚Äúvibe master.‚Äù We‚Äôll break down the essentials of designing fast, intuitive, and good-looking UIs without needing a full-time designer in the loop.





<!-- Something about how vibe coding makes you code fast, so now design is the skill you need to move fast and build the best products.
Perhaps also something on how this newsletter will help you build good taste for vibes/ become a vibe master

perhaps some bits on how removing the need for a designer removes a person from the loop, effectively make you faster -->

The rise of LLMs mean that engineers code superfast now. LLMs also have another under utilized skill that can help engineers ship fast and not be blocked by a designer: design skills.

In this newsletter we dive into how exactly you can vibe design your way to shipping great products.


## Step 1: Understand basic UI principles

Design isn‚Äôt magic ‚Äì it‚Äôs a set of rules you can learn. And applying them correctly means you don‚Äôt need to guess what looks good.

Start with these seven foundational principles:

1. **Hierarchy**  
  ‚Üí Make the most important thing on the screen visually dominant. Use larger font sizes, bold weights, and more prominent positioning.  
  üí° **Tip**: Ask yourself *"What do I want the user to notice first?"*

2. **Contrast**  
  ‚Üí Use color, size, and shape to differentiate elements. Ensure buttons and interactive elements stand out from the background. 
  üí° **Tip**: Test your layout in grayscale ‚Äì if it still works, your contrast is good.  

3. **Consistency**  
  ‚Üí The more often a user sees the same layout, color, or interaction pattern, the less they have to think. Familiarity speeds them up. Inconsistent UI, on the other hand, makes every screen feel like a new puzzle. 
  üí° **Tip**: Treat every design decision as a chance to remove a micro-decision for the user.  

4. **Alignment**  
   ‚Üí A clean visual structure helps users process content faster. When elements snap to a grid, the eye flows naturally. When they don‚Äôt, the brain hesitates.
  üí° **Tip**: Use a consistent grid system and check your edges. If one button is 3px off, fix it ‚Äì it‚Äôs breaking the vibe.

5. **Proximity**  
   ‚Üí Place related elements close together. Labels should hug their inputs. Actions should live near their targets.
  üí° **Tip**: If two elements are related but far apart, group them or your user will miss the connection.

6. **Balance**  
   ‚Üí Every element on the screen has visual weight. If there's too much weight on one side,it feels lopsided. Distribute your text, imagery, and whitespace so the layout feels stable
  üí° **Tip**: Try the squint test‚Äîblur your eyes and see where the visual ‚Äúweight‚Äù lands. If it clumps in one spot, rebalance.

Want to polish even further? Browse Laws of UX or dip into basic color theory to elevate your layouts without overthinking it.

## Step 2: Build strong opinions

Great design isn‚Äôt neutral ‚Äì it‚Äôs opinionated. It removes the irrelevant and emphasizes what matters. 

Every choice you leave to the user is a chance to make them hesitate. Every dropdown is a question. Every "optional" setting is a delay. Every unclear label is a moment of cognitive load.

You're making your user work. And your user? They have a job to be done. They just want to click and move on.

Don't get me wrong, asking the user to make a decision in itself isn't a bad thing. Joel Spolsky, founder of Stack Overflow summarized it perfectly in his [post on UI design](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/10/24/user-interface-design-for-programmers/):

>  "Freedom of choice can be wonderful. The problem comes when you ask them to make a choice that they don‚Äôt care about."

So how do you know what your users actually care about? [You ask them](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/talk-to-users).

But even before that, you can ask yourself the following questions when building a feature:

- What's the core job the user is trying to complete?
- What's the fastest, clearest way to help them succeed?
- What can I remove without breaking the experience?
- What decision am I forcing the user to make that I could just make for them?
- Would this make sense to someone who‚Äôs tired, distracted, or seeing it for the first time?

## Step 3. Build your prompt

Armed with your UI and UX principles from step 1 and step 2, you can use tools like [v0](https://v0.dev/), [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), or [Bolt](https://bolt.new/) to craft your designs. The key is to build a great prompt.

Start by researching 2-3 products that solve the same or similar problem. Click around and pay attention to how the interface looks and feels. A few things to think about:

- Where does your eyes go first, and is that intentional?
- How many steps does it take to complete a core action?
- Does the layout make me feel calm and in control or overwhelmed and unsure?
- Are empty states or error states handled thoughtfully?
- Do the patterns, styles, and flows feel unified across the experience?

Take notes and screenshots on what you like and dislike about each product. You'll use this in your prompt.

Once you‚Äôve done that, it‚Äôs time to feed the model real context. LLMs can generate much better UI when they understand your app‚Äôs existing design system. That means attaching actual files from your codebase. Good context includes:

- **UI components** ‚Äì e.g. `components/ui/button`, `input`, `card` , custom [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components 
  Defines your core visual and interaction patterns.
- **Layout primitives** ‚Äì e.g. `layout/container`, `grid`, `flex-wrapper`  
  Shows how you handle spacing and structure.
- **Design tokens** ‚Äì e.g. `tailwind.config.js`, `theme.js`  
  Sets your colors, typography, and spacing scale.
- **Page layouts** ‚Äì e.g. `layouts/app-layout`, `dashboard-layout`  
  Shows how full pages are composed‚Äîheader, sidebar, content.
- **Real screens** ‚Äì e.g. `pages/settings`, `user-profile`  
  Demonstrates how everything comes together in practice.

Now pull it all together with a focused, detailed prompt. Here‚Äôs a simple template you can adapt:

```md
# Feature Brief

You're helping me design and build a new feature for my app.

## Goal
Create a UI for: <short one-line feature description>  
Target user: <who is using this and why>

## Requirements
- <list functional requirements>
- <specific UI interactions or constraints>
- Ensure it's optimized for <mobile / desktop / both>

## Existing System  
Match the look and feel of my existing product. I've included:  

- `tailwind.config.js` ‚Äì for design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)  
- `components/ui/button`, `input`, `card` ‚Äì core reusable components  
- `layout/container`, `grid`, `flex-wrapper` ‚Äì layout primitives  
- `layouts/app-layout`, `dashboard-layout` ‚Äì page structure  
- `pages/settings`, `user-profile` ‚Äì real examples of how everything comes together  

Use these files as references for styling, structure, and component reuse.

## Design Intent
The UI should feel: <clean, fast, minimal, playful, etc.>  
Prioritize: <clarity, speed, minimal steps, mobile-first, etc.>

## Inspiration from Competitors

### <Competitor Name>
**What works well:**
- <list of patterns or layouts you like>

**What doesn't:**
- <list of things to avoid>

Refer to the attached screenshots for additional context.

## Visual Principles  

Use these as a foundation for layout and structure:

- **Hierarchy** ‚Äì Emphasize what matters most
- **Contrast** ‚Äì Make key actions stand out
- **Consistency** ‚Äì Repeat visual patterns to reduce cognitive load
- **Alignment** ‚Äì Snap to a clear grid for visual flow
- **Proximity** ‚Äì Group related elements together
- **Balance** ‚Äì Distribute visual weight evenly across the layout
```

This should get you 90% of the way there. The next 10% is polishing your UI and interactions.

## Step 4: Ship it and iterate

Ship early. Ship messy if you have to. Just **ship**.

Real users will teach you more in one session than any internal review or gut check ever will

- Ship behind a [feature flag](https://posthog.com/newsletter/feature-flag-mistakes) if you‚Äôre nervous.
- Use [session replay](https://posthog.com/session-replay) to see where people hesitate, rage click, or get stuck.
- Track funnels to know whether your actually UX works ‚Äì not just if it looks clean.
- Talk to real users.  Ask what felt slow, confusing, or unnecessary.
- Keep iterating. One small fix at a time compounds fast.
 
## TL;DR

You don‚Äôt need a designer to build great UI. You need good taste, strong opinions, and the right prompt.

- Great design isn‚Äôt about looking pretty. It's about reducing friction and helping users get things done.
- Learn a few core design principles and you can get 80% of the way there.
- A great prompt and real code context give LLMs everything they need to generate good UI.
- The final 10%: Ship it, watch users struggle, and make it better.

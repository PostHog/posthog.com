Remote work sucks. If you work at Dell, that is. The company [recently announced](https://www.businessinsider.com/dell-remote-workers-promotion-return-office-push-flexible-work-2024-3) that remote employees would not be considered for promotions or be able to change roles. Dell’s rationale, something to do with “in-person connections” and “value differentiation,” is as tired as an entry-level Dell Inspiron trying to run _Cyberpunk 2077_.

But the policy actually makes sense for Dell. Sort of. When you’re a decades-old behemoth built around people working in offices, implementing remote work policies that actually work is hard. But it doesn't have to be. There are some key principles that any company – big or small, young or old, or Dell – can follow to realize the potential of remote working. 

**This week, we explain:** how to make remote work actually work.

## Problem #1: A a two-tier system

If you’re a company built around [big](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/google-to-crack-down-on-hybrid-work-asks-remote-workers-to-reconsider.html), [shiny](https://gizmodo.com/apple-remote-work-return-to-office-hybrid-work-1850256210) [offices](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/tech/elon-musk-tesla-ends-work-from-home/index.html), then chances are you have a two-tiered system. Essentially, an employee’s ability to move up in such a company is closely linked to their proximity to the biggest, shiniest office. Dell’s new policy acknowledges this outright: if you’re a remote worker at Dell, there’s no career progression. The same is true at many companies that have a mix of remote, hybrid, and office workers.

### The solution: Aggressive transparency

Rather than presentism and nepotism, career progression should be linked to a transparent framework of measurable goals. Do the work, do it well, deliver value for customers, and you’ll be rewarded. Leif Singer, a software engineer at Automattic, the company behind WordPress, has shared some great examples of [how this works in practice](https://youtu.be/aRiP72kRrnc?feature=shared). Key points: 

- Give employees the freedom grow in ways they find interesting. Make career paths more individual and don't force people to follow a predetermined ladder. This gives people more ownership over their work and makes them more motivated.
- Review compensation regularly based on transparent, objective metrics. This approach helps remove bias and creates a culture where people can focus on doing their best work, not gaming an opaque system to try and get a promotion.
- Ensure that employees both get and give regular feedback on their work and career progression. At Automattic, employees and team leads regularly request and give feedback on how things are going. Compensation is adjusted based on the impact their work had on the company.```

Clearly defining and then publishing your system for career progression is an important first step to making sure that everyone is assessed using the same objective criteria. At PostHog, the way we approach [career progression](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/career-progression) and [feedback](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/feedback) is laid out in public for anyone to see.

But transparency doesn’t stop there. Remote work pioneer GitLab does everything out in the open and has published a [2,000-page handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) covering, well, everything. At PostHog, [our handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook) is one of the most important documents we’ve ever written. Why? If you want to find out anything about the company, you can – from what [individual teams](https://posthog.com/teams) are working on right now, to how much we would pay to [hire a full stack engineer in Brunei](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/compensation), to how our co-founders [like](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/james-hawkins) to [work](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser). This transparent approach gives everyone access to the same information and allows them to focus on doing their best work, not navigating layers of corporate bureaucracy.

## Problem #2 Messy communication

Making remote work actually work requires making big cultural and procedural changes. Fixing how your company communicates is one of the hardest as it requires everyone to buy in and change their behavior. That means saying goodbye to email, setting fire to Microsoft Teams, and training people to be much more effective communicators. Here’s how.

### The solution: Write. Everything. Down

How do I [file expenses](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money)? Who is [our ideal customer](https://posthog.com/handbook/who-we-are-building-for)? What’s the product analytics team [focused on this quarter](https://posthog.com/teams/product-analytics)?

Don't hide the answers to these questions in out-of-date Google Docs, or worse still, inside someone’s brain. Instead, write them down in a handbook where anyone can access them. Ours is public, but an internal wiki is fine too.

Why? Because:

1. **It’s faster.** Scheduling is hard and meetings interrupt deep work. If something can be written down, it will save time and improve transparency around decision-making. Plus, it's more efficient to have a meeting to align everyone _after_ you've all written down what you think.

2. **It’s always there.** If a decision is made on a call and nobody writes it down, was a decision even made? Calls are information black holes so, when you do have a meeting about something, make sure someone, [or something](https://www.sembly.ai/), is taking notes.

3. **It’s clearer.** Seriously, have you ever read a transcript of you speaking? Writing things down makes you think through both what you’re trying to achieve and how you want to communicate it, making everyone more intentional.

Defaulting to written communication means, chances are, if someone has a question they don’t have to wait for an answer – they can go find it themselves. And if they can’t find an answer, writing a clear, concise question in a public channel on Slack will ensure that everyone can see the answer. 

Automattic’s Beau Lebens has [some great tips](https://beau.blog/2020/03/remote-work-at-scale/) on putting this into practice:

- **Tools are not the answer.** Installing a bunch of bots to transcribe meetings and run automated functions in Slack will only work if you do all the hard work first. And nailing how you communicate is a big part of that.

## Problem #3: Death by Zoom

Online meetings are the scourge of remote work – and often a cause of tension between office-based and non-office based employees. Mics off when they should be on, screenshare chaos, [Jeffrey Toobin’s penis](https://www.wired.com/story/jeffrey-toobin-zoom-penis/) – they remain a technical nightmare and a productivity black hole. Many companies see them as a necessary evil – a way for colleagues, no matter where they’re based, to collaborate. This is wrong.

Since the pandemic, [time spent in online meetings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/great-expectations-making-hybrid-work-work) has gone up 253%. Some Teams users [spend](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work) close to eight hours a week, or an entire workday, in online meetings. And if you’re a manager or executive within an organization, this is all your fault.

### The solution: Kill meetings

Way back in 2009, Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham [wrote](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) about the difference between the “maker’s schedule” and the “manager’s schedule.” In an office setting, these two schedules (sort of) work side by side. But when the pandemic forced almost every office-based company in the world to go full-time remote, things got messy.

At a lot of companies, this has forced way too many people onto the “manager’s schedule.” If this is your company, burn your weekly schedule to the ground and start again. Then rebuild it and follow these remote work commandments:

**Meeting-free days.** At PostHog, we’re [anti-meeting by default](https://posthog.com/blog/meetings). We have two meeting-free days a week and, when we do have meetings, they’re short and focused. 
**Communicate asynchronously.** We communicate asynchronously via GitHub and Slack. There are lots and tools and systems for this, but the success of asynchronous communication really comes down to good, clear writing.
**Focus on deep work.** Fewer meetings means more time for deep work. This allows not just engineers, but everyone at the company, to focus on doing their best work how they see best. 

A lot of companies, big and small, have adopted this approach. GitLab and Automattic for starters, but also [Twist](https://async.twist.com/asynchronous-communication/), [Buffer](https://buffer.com/about), and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/jobs/culture-and-values-at-zapier) have all followed a similar blueprint to make remote work actually work for both managers and engineers.

### Problem #4: Lack of trust

This is probably the biggest (and stupidest) argument against remote working. Statistics on this issue abound, but here are some key findings: remote work [doesn’t affect productivity, at all](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/remote-work-doesn-t-seem-to-affect-productivity-fed-study-finds). That’s not according to some random survey, that’s based on detailed research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 

Study after study has also shown that remote workers are happier, more diverse, and that they stay at companies for longer and, as a result, do better work. That’s especially true [for engineers and developers](https://www.shakebugs.com/blog/why-let-developers-work-remotely/). Stackoverflow has a great guide that navigates the confusing [mess of statistics](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/11/27/are-remote-workers-more-productive-that-s-the-wrong-question/) around productivity and remote work.

Ultimately, companies that want to make remote working work – and create a motivated, ambitious, and productive working environment – have to put a huge amount of trust in their employees. So, perhaps counter-intuitively, the solution to the perceived problem of productivity amongst remote workers is to go all-in on trust.

### The solution: Trust like you’ve never trusted before

What does that mean in practice? First up, employers need to set clear and transparent expectations and then, within that framework, give people total freedom to get the job done. Buffer co-founder and CEO Joel Gascoigne laid all this out [almost a decade ago](https://buffer.com/resources/why-transparency/). It’s still true today.

Focus on output, not time-in-seat. As an employer, you need to be open and honest and demand the same of your employees. Building an organization around trust also means you need to hire carefully. Give the wrong people too much trust and, yes, they might abuse it. But give the right people trust and you’ll create a company that thrives on autonomy. 

Companies that have made remote working work also have one other thing in common: transparency. It’s super important. PostHog co-founder James Hawkins [explains why](https://posthog.com/founders/how-to-run-a-transparent-company): “Transparency makes the whole company a joint project, between our team and the community around it too.”

That might sound a bit effusive, but getting it right has a tangible impact. Transparency about how you run a company helps employees buy into what you’re building. Here’s why trust and transparency are key for remote work:

* **Empowerment: **Hire the right people and give them the freedom to do their best work. This creates a culture of ownership which, in turn, makes people more engaged and productive.

* **Openness: **Be aggressively transparent and default to communicating out in the open. This not only makes asynchronous working easier, it also helps bring remote teams closer together.

* **Investment: **Trust gets you a long way, but you also have to invest to really make that trust work. Almost all successful remote companies do offsites once a year. At PostHog, we also provide all employees with a [quarterly travel budget](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money) to meet up with colleagues for work and fun.

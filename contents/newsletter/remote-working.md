Remote work sucks. If you work at Dell, that is. The company [recently announced](https://www.businessinsider.com/dell-remote-workers-promotion-return-office-push-flexible-work-2024-3) that remote employees would not be considered for promotions or be able to change roles. Dell’s rationale, which has something to do with “in-person connections” and “value differentiation,” is as tired as an entry-level Dell Inspiron trying to run _Cyberpunk 2077_.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The best remote teams are brimming with energy, they’re super productive, and do incredible work. So whether you’re part of a remote team, leading one, or want to go remote, here’s how the best of the best make it work, with some tips on how you can up your game, too.

### 1. They write everything down

Remote work doesn't work without a strong writing culture. Documenting by default – be it information on how to [file expenses](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money), your [ICP](https://posthog.com/handbook/who-we-are-building-for), or what a specific team is [working on this quarter](https://posthog.com/teams/product-analytics) – gives everyone access to the same information, regardless of seniority or location.

Why does this work? Because:

1. **It’s faster.** Scheduling is hard and meetings interrupt deep work. If something can be written down, it will save time and improve transparency around decision-making. Plus, it's more efficient to have a meeting to align everyone after you've all written down what you think.

2. **It’s always there.** If a decision is made on a call and nobody writes it down, was a decision even made? Calls are information black holes so, when you do have a meeting about something, make sure someone, or something, is taking notes. Better yet, don't have a meeting.

3. **It’s clearer.** Seriously, have you ever read a transcript of you speaking? Writing is thinking, so it helps you think through both what you’re trying to achieve and how you want to communicate it, making everyone more intentional.

How does this work in practice?


At **PostHog**, it started with [our company handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook) – it’s one of the most important things we’ve ever made. It helps everyone understand what we're trying to build and why. Handbooks don't have to be public, but we were inspired by GitLab's [2,000-page handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/), which covers every aspect of how its 2,000+ team members work across 65+ countries.

At **Automattic**, Beau Lebens has [shared some great tips](https://beau.blog/2020/03/remote-work-at-scale/) on how to communicate effectively as a remote team and explains traps to avoid. One key takeaway: tools are not the answer. Installing a bunch of bots to transcribe meetings and run automated functions in Slack will only help if you do all the hard work first.

At **Doist**, and just about any successful remote company, internal email is pretty much banned. As Doist founder and CEO Amir Salihefendic [explains](https://async.twist.com/asynchronous-communication/), email locks information away. This makes referring back to decisions or conversations either confusing or impossible. Default to communicating out in the open – GitHub, Slack, an internal wiki – so anyone can refer back to conversations and decisions at a later date.

### 2. They treasure deep work

In an office setting, the [maker’s schedule](https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) and the manager’s schedule (sort of) work side by side. But the manager's schedule is the enemy of remote work. Successful remote teams avoid it entirely, which makes them incredibly good at getting shit done.

At **PostHog**, we’re [anti-meeting by default](https://posthog.com/blog/meetings). We have two meeting-free days a week and, when we do have meetings, they’re short, focused, and we take and share written notes where possible. We also only invite people who absolutely need to be there. We optimize for productivity, not presence.

At **Doist**, four days of each week are [dedicated to deep work](https://async.twist.com/heroes-housekeeping-days/), with Fridays reserved for housekeeping – bug fixes, battling technical debt, reading, research, and other smaller tasks. It’s an extreme version of time blocking – essentially blocking out four days a week for shipping, with one day reserved for everything else.

When you absolutely have to have meetings, make the most of them. **GitLab** has a set of principles for how notes should be taken in [just about any meeting](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#smart-note-taking-in-meetings). This starts with the agenda, which is shared in advance. During meetings, everyone is encouraged to help out with note-taking with a focus on capturing key points rather than every single word that’s said. 

### 3. They value transparency and trust over process

The biggest (and stupidest) argument against remote work? It makes people less productive. Statistics on this issue abound, but here are some key findings: remote work [doesn’t affect productivity, at all](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/remote-work-doesn-t-seem-to-affect-productivity-fed-study-finds). That’s not according to some random survey, that’s based on detailed research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 

Study after study has also shown that remote workers are happier, more diverse, and that they stay at companies for longer and, as a result, do better work. That’s especially true for [engineers and developers](https://www.shakebugs.com/blog/why-let-developers-work-remotely/). Stackoverflow has a great guide that navigates the [confusing mess of statistics](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/11/27/are-remote-workers-more-productive-that-s-the-wrong-question/) around productivity and remote work.

Ultimately, teams and companies that really make remote working work have to go big on transparency and trust. The best remote companies are transparent by design, but how do you build trust? Here’s a checklist.

- Give people autonomy. At **PostHog**, we hire people who work well with high level direction and who are comfortable stepping on toes to get things done. We trust people to do their best work and, in return, they deliver.

- Feedback. **GitLab** has a [policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) of “blameless problem solving.” Simply put, when something goes wrong, the investigation of the root cause is, as the company puts it, blameless. This encourages everyone to speak up without fear of punishment. People are trusted to make mistakes and, as a result, problems that do arise are easier to solve.

- Work in public. At **Zapier**, trust and transparency are a big part of the [company’s values](https://zapier.com/jobs/culture-and-values-at-zapier). As co-founder and CEO Wade Foster explains: “Transparency promotes equity and inclusion within our team and customer base. So work in public. Have discussions in the open and document your work.” The most successful remote companies build everything out in the open. This gives everyone the context they need to do their very best work across multiple time zones.

- Shared values. The most successful remote teams have a shared set of values and behaviors – and these are often clearly defined in a public handbook. These values and behaviors are more important than dictatorial processes. As **Buffer** co-founder and CEO Joel Gascoigne wrote [almost a decade ago](https://buffer.com/resources/why-transparency/), “transparency breeds trust, and trust is is the foundation of great teamwork.” It’s still true today.

### 4. They make time to meet-up

Pretty much all successful remote teams have one thing in common: they’re not remote all the time. No, that doesn’t mean hybrid working, it means offsites. Great offsites are a lot of fun but also highly intentional and help remote teams come together to work on big, specific problems. They also help build bonds that make asynchronous work more creative and collaborative for the rest of the year.

At **PostHog**, we organize an annual offsite. We’re far from alone, but we think we’re pretty good at them. The typical agenda includes a couple of big social events, team dinners, a day-long hackathon, all-hands strategy sessions and workshops, company culture exercises, and time for people to get some downtime and explore. 

Want to know how we plan great offsites? Look no further than [our handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/offsites) – it even has a comprehensive checklist and some templates you can use to get started. But, for successful remote teams, meeting up goes beyond annual offsites. We also encourage individual teams to get together once a year to dig into specific projects and do in-person onboarding for all our new hires. Everyone at the company also has a quarterly travel budget so they can meet up with colleagues all over the world and solve some of the company’s biggest challenges.

### Good reads for making remote working really work 📖

**[Building an all-remote company from scratch](https://posthog.com/founders/remote-culture) – James Hawkins**

This is exactly how we built a fully-remote company from the ground up. This was written in 2020 when we were 12 people. Today, we’re almost 50 and it’s still working.

Many makers (hello, product engineers!) have been working remotely successfully for years. But managers can often struggle. This is how your company can fix that problem.

**[Why remote work is so hard – and how it can be fixed](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/can-remote-work-be-fixed) – Cal Newport**

This is a great, detailed read on the long-standing problems that have scuppered remote work. And it’s written by Cal Newport, who also coined the term “deep work.”

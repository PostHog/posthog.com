We get a lot of job applications. In the last two months, we’ve had 900 people apply for engineering roles:

* 86 got a first interview
* 55 got a technical interview
* 10 did a [SuperDay](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/hiring-process#4-posthog-superday) 
* 4 were hired

That means we hired 0.4% of people who applied for engineering roles.

So, how do you join the 0.4% of superstar engineers – not just at PostHog, but at any other fast-growing startup?

## Think like a recruiter 

First, some hard truths. There’s a huge gap between what job applicants and recruiters experience. With the exception of very early-stage companies, most startups will use an applicant tracking system like Ashby, Greenhouse, or Lever for hiring. These are designed for speed, not to make you look good. 

You need to think about the information density of your application – less dense is good – and also avoid any formatting that the application system is likely to remove. Keep it simple.

The same rules apply for your resume. Prioritize clarity over design. Black text, white background, no fancy graphics. And please, no profile pictures.

### Brevity is your friend

A startup recruiter will, if you’re lucky, spend more than a few seconds reading your application. Brevity and clarity are key to try and ensure your application isn’t quickly dismissed.

We did the math and, on average, we spend less than one minute reviewing each application we receive. Automated or junk applications (hello, ChatGPT) will be discarded in less than five seconds. Truly great applications will be read for up to five minutes.

### Spend time on a short cover letter

And we mean short. Five to ten sentences is fine. Don’t rewrite your resume. Keep it is simple.

Match the company’s tone – if the job ad is informal, don’t start your cover letter with ‘Dear Sir/Madam.’ And never, ever, use ChatGPT. Not even to help you with a draft. We’ll know, it’s always obvious.

Particularly strong cover letters we’ve received recently include the following:

* An explanation of exactly why you want to join a company – and why the company should want to hire you.

* A clear understanding of the company, its values, what it is trying to achieve, and an explanation of how you can help.

* A genuine and deep knowledge of the product you’ll be working on.
* Do a little something to make you stand out. For example, as part of his application, Marcus, one of our support engineers, [opened a PR](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/4922) to add him to the team page. It certainly got our attention.

### One simple, annoying trick

Get ready to groan, but there’s one thing that will really help: get a proper, warm referral. We trust our team’s judgment, so a referral can really help us pre-filter applicants.

How do you get a warm referral? Bombshell: be a great human and a great engineer. So good, in fact, that other human beings will attest to your greatness. 

This does not mean you should randomly spam people on LinkedIn for an intro (this never works), but it does mean you should work hard wherever you go and leave a great impression. People talk to each other. And, who knows, one day maybe they’ll talk about you and be really nice.

## Ask the right questions

One way we’re able to recognize [10x engineers](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/beyond-the-10x-engineer) at the interview stage is by the questions they ask. It’s not rude to ask very specific questions, it shows you’re genuinely curious about what we’re doing. These are the questions you should be asking when interviewing with a startup founder.

### Does the company have product-market fit?

Very few engineers ask this when we do interviews. Ask! You can and should also ask about revenue and the number of daily active users. Very early-stage startups might not have product-market fit, but they should have a plan for how to get there quickly.

[Strong product-market fit](https://posthog.com/founders/measure-product-market-fit) happens when a company is able to combine significant top-line growth with meaningful usage and a flat retention curve.

### How much runway does the company have?

Or, simply put: is the company default alive? A company with very little runway and no product-market fit is likely to have a challenging culture. Asking these kinds of questions will get you much closer to understanding what the company is like to work for than lazily asking about the company’s culture.

Sure, a startup might not be profitable – but it should have a plan to be profitable before it runs out of money. If it doesn’t, ask why. Avoid companies that don’t know if they’re default alive or not – or don’t care about it. 

### If you could throw money at a problem and solve it immediately, what would it be?

Superstar engineers are laser-focused on working out where a company is struggling and how they can help. Asking this question shows you want to understand our biggest problems and are ready to throw yourself into solving them by shipping and shipping fast. 

If you get the role, you need to be proactive in speaking to users, understanding problems big and small, taking ownership of them, and fixing them.

## Know the signs of a great engineering role

We’ve received 9,000 applications for roles in the last 12 months. One thing we hear a lot? People like our job ads. That’s nice! But writing great job descriptions isn’t just important for recruiting, it’s also an important clue when hunting for a new job. This is what you should be looking out for in a job description for an engineering role at a startup.

* **Really tight requirements.** A list of must-haves and a list of nice-to-haves. Each should be around four items long, that’s it.
* **A clear and simple hiring process.** How many interviews are there? Is there a work trial? If so, what is it? And is it paid? If you know exactly what the hiring process is – and how long it takes – that’s a good sign.

* **Total salary transparency.** This could be a range or it could be a tool that allows you to see an estimate of your potential salary. Either way, salary transparency is a must-have.

* **The job description is fun to read.** No startup should be writing stodgy, corporate-esque job descriptions. They should be stylish, interesting, and entertaining. This helps you better understand the company culture before you (hopefully) receive an offer.

## Be cracked

This is a little subjective – but we’re obsessed with hiring [cracked engineers](https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto). ‘Cracked’ means engineers who take extreme ownership of ideas, who are always optimistic, who make people feel excited and energized, are authentic, and who apply themselves to their craft.

We’re not looking for fancy companies on a resume, we’re not looking for assholes, we don’t really care about how much experience you’ve got, but we do care if you’ve got a great side project.

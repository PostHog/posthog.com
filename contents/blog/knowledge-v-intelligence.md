Software has eaten the world, and now we're drowning in data. I'm so sorry if you're a PostHog user – we've been complicit. I'm hoping we can make amends today.

## The knowledge curse

The fundamental problem of the information age: raw knowledge is 💩.

For us in software, it's second nature to capture every step of a user's journey: pageviews, clicks, business events, errors, feedback, entire user sessions, various organizational sources. That's PostHog. You want to build the most successful product and business. Flying blind obviously isn't smart.

And how much of the data are you able to convert into action? I know - time is a flat circle, and we're right back to the <abbr title="Business Intelligence, for the innocent">BI</abbr> meme of "actionable insights". Always just one excellent dashboard away from finding diamonds.

The fact is, combing through events is free-form work that takes serious time. Watching hundreds of sessions isn't any better. Then - and here's where it gets really fun - you need to actually _do_ something with the learnings. Build the new feature and roll out behind a feature flag. Set up an experiment.

Each piece of knowledge spawns three more tasks. It's turtles all the way down.

## The missing link

Let me be direct about what PostHog has been from the beginning: a really damn good **knowledge layer**.
A dozen tools in one, each capturing a different part of the user journey. The whole stack.

But even with all that data, even with powerful dashboards, you needed the heaps of work to slice it and dice it.
The bottleneck hasn't been presentation or querying, but _intelligence_.

With LLMs we have, for the first time, automated a meaningful level of intelligence.  No point in waiting for AGI to be declared by a committee. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex – call them C4 they've already been explosive for software engineering. Building the next feature in code is increasingly about defining its implementation at a high level.

It's not the math exam skills that make LLMs relevant, but something even fresher: the ability to achieve goals by stringing together different tools in a loop. That's what serious research is about.

## The next era of building products

With PostHog AI, we're launching the **intelligence layer** for building products.

Ask PostHog AI a question about your users, and it reasons about which data to pull, combines multiple sources, interprets the results, and explains what it means for your product. It analyzes hundreds of session recordings in a couple of minutes. It sets up new flags and experiments in seconds.

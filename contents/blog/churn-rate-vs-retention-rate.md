## Definition of churn rate and retention rate

Churn rate measures the rate at which customers leave your service or product. It's normally expressed as a percentage of total customers over a specific period of time, such as monthly or annually. 

So, if your product has 100 customers and 10 of them cancel their subscription within a month, the churn rate for that month would be 10%. Needless to say, a low churn rate is desirable; a high churn rate isn't.

In its simplest form, retention rate is the inverse of churn rate. Using the same example, if you have 100 customers and 10 of them cancel their subscription, you'd have a 90% retention rate.

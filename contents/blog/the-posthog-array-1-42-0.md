New team member Thomas Obermueller has got off to a great start by delivering the much-requested area chart visualization for PostHog insights. Now, if a normal line chart isn't  enough and a regular bar chart won't satisfy then you have an exciting third option.

To [quote Thomas](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/12869) himself: "_The main use case for this is when you want to see the composition of a metric, while also having the total value as a reference e.g. breakdown of revenue by customer over time._"

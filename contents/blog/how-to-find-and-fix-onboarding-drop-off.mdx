Seeing a spike in users leaving your onboarding flow can be discouraging, but **here's the good news:** [It doesn't mean your product sucks](https://posthog.com/founders/product-market-fit-game) (phew!)

Onboarding drop-offs are usually an indication of friction, not rejection. Users don't rage-quit because they hate your product, they quit because something didn't make sense, didn't work, or asked for too much too soon.

*It's like attempting a beef wellington, realizing you're in over your head somewhere around the "wrap the beef in mushroom duxelles" step, and bailing to order pizza instead. Ask me how I know.*

**Even better news**: onboarding friction is measurable, debuggable, and fixable.

This recipe shows you how to find where users drop off during onboarding and, more importantly, how to fix it

## What you'll need

### Ingredients

You don't need a massive stack for this recipe.

**Required:**
- [A product analytics tool](https://posthog.com/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools) (for building your onboarding funnel)
- [A session replay tool](https://posthog.com/blog/best-session-replay-tools) (for watching what users actually do)

*Optional, but recommended:*
- [Autocapture](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) (for skipping manual event setup)
- [Cohorts or segmentation](https://posthog.com/docs/data/cohorts) (for slicing data by user type)
- [Feature flags](https://posthog.com/feature-flags) (for safely rolling out fixes)
- [Experiments](https://posthog.com/experiments) (for measuring statistical significance in your changes)
- [Surveys](https://posthog.com/surveys) (for getting direct feedback from users)

### Substitutions

**No session replay tool?** You can interview users directly instead, but you'll be relying on their memory of what happened rather than what actually happened. It works, it's just slower and less reliable. [Here's our guide to running effective user interviews](https://posthog.com/blog/10x-engineers-do-user-interviews) if you go this route.

**No surveys?** It's okay, replays will get you 80% of the way there; the other 20% is context you'll have to infer.

**No feature flags?** You can ship straight to production. We won't judge. (...we will judge a little.) If something breaks, you'll just have to roll back manually. [Here's why we think feature flags are worth it](https://posthog.com/blog/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases).

**No cohorts or segmentation?** You can still run this recipe, you'll just be looking at all users as one group. If your drop-off is consistent across everyone, that's fine. If it's not, you'll have a harder time figuring out who's actually struggling.

### Before you start

You'll need:
- **A clear definition of what "successful onboarding" looks like*8. This is [your activation event](https://posthog.com/newsletter/wtf-is-activation) – the moment a user has gotten enough value to stick around (more on this below).
- **At least a few hundred users going through your flow**. You need enough data to spot patterns. If you're at an earlier stage, you can still follow this recipe; just watch more replays and lean harder on qualitative signals until your numbers catch up.

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

PostHog installed in your product and receiving data. If you haven't set this up yet, [start here](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install). Make sure you're capturing the key events in your onboarding flow (signups, form completions, button clicks, etc.). If you have autocapture enabled, you're probably already covered.

Identified users (*not required, but nice to have*). If you're calling [`posthog.identify()`](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/identify) when users sign up or log in, you'll be able to track them across sessions and devices. This makes your funnel data much more reliable.

</details>

## Step 1: Prep the finish line

Before you can fix your onboarding, you need to [define what a successful onboarding flow actually means](https://posthog.com/docs/new-to-posthog/activation). This is your activation event, the thing you'll measure everything against.

Ask yourself: What's the moment when a user has gotten enough value that they're likely to stick around?

*Signing up*, or *landing on a dashboard* is not it; what you're looking for is a *value-producing action*.

Some examples:
- **For a project management tool**: Created their first project and invited a teammate
- **For an analytics product**: Sent their first event and created an insight
- **For a CRM**: Added their first contact and sent an email

Not sure what yours is? Try looking at your [retention data](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/retention) – what do retained users do that churned users don't? That should give you a starting point. Here's [how we figured out our activation metric at PostHog](https://posthog.com/product-engineers/activation-metrics) (spoiler: it took a few iterations).

Pick one. Be opinionated. You can always adjust later.

## Step 2: Build a funnel

Now you're ready to cook.

In your analytics tool, create a funnel with the steps a user must complete to reach your activation event.

A simple example:
1. `$pageview` on `/signup/success` (or a custom `signed_up` event)
2. `profile_completed`
3. `first_project_created`
4. `teammate_invited` (the last step is your activation event)

A few tips:
- Start with 3-5 steps max. Too many steps and you'll have trouble identifying the real problem areas.
- Use sequential order (the default) so users must complete steps in the order you've defined.
- Set a reasonable conversion window (7 to 14 days is a good starting point).

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

Head to [Product Analytics](https://app.posthog.com/insights) → **New insight** → [**Funnel**](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/funnels). If you have [autocapture](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/autocapture) enabled, many of these events may already be tracked for you; check your [activity](https://app.posthog.com/events) to see what's coming in.

</details>

## Step 3: Let it simmer

Save your funnel and let data collect for at least a week. You need enough users going through the flow to see meaningful patterns; looking too early is how you end up "fixing" problems that don't exist.

As a rough guideline:
- A few hundred users entering onboarding is usually enough to start
- More is better if you plan to [segment by user type or device later](https://posthog.com/blog/how-to-do-user-segmentation)

While you wait, you can:
- [Set up session replay, if you haven't already](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay)
- [Prep an exit survey for later](https://posthog.com/docs/surveys/creating-surveys) (we'll use it in Step 6)

When you can throw the data at the wall and it starts sticking, you're ready for the next step.

## Step 4: Find the leak

Now that your funnel is showing you where users are falling off, look for:
- **The step with the lowest relative conversion rate** – this is usually your biggest opportunity
- **Absolute numbers** – sometimes a step has decent conversion but is still losing you thousands of users

If everyone drops off at the same step, it's probably a UX problem. Something about that step is broken or confusing for all users.

If only *some* users drop off, it's a context problem. Something about who they are or how they got there is causing friction.

If it's a context problem, try segmenting your funnel to find a clearer diagnosis:
- New users vs. returning users
- Invited users vs. self-serve signups
- Browser, device, or OS
- Plan type or pricing tier

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

Click on the drop-off number in your funnel to see the actual users who didn't make it. You can save these as a [cohort](https://posthog.com/docs/data/cohorts) for further analysis – useful for targeting with surveys later, or watching their replays in Step 5.

Use [breakdowns](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/funnels#breakdowns) to slice your funnel by user properties, device, or any event property.

</details>

---

By the end of this step, you should be able to say: "Users drop off most at *[this step]*" and "It affects *[these users]* more than others." If you can't say both, don't move on yet.

If you do, you're ready for the fun part: watching what actually happens.

## Step 5: Watch the replays

You know where users drop off, [now you need to find out *why*](https://posthog.com/tutorials/explore-insights-session-recordings).

Watch 10–15 recordings. You're looking for patterns:
- Are users getting confused at a specific UI element?
- Are they rage-clicking something that doesn't work?
- Are they abandoning after seeing a specific screen (pricing, permissions request, etc.)?
- Are they hitting errors? (Check the console logs in the replay; PostHog [captures these](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/console-log-recording) too.)
- Is something failing quietly? Look at network requests if you have [network recording](https://posthog.com/docs/session-replay/network-recording) enabled.

If recordings are looking wildly different from one user to the next, go back to Step 4 and segment further. You're probably mixing multiple problems together. Cleaner inputs make cleaner diagnoses.

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

**Fastest way:** Click directly on the drop-off in your funnel – PostHog will pull up recordings for those users automatically. (This is one of the nice things about having replay and analytics in one tool!)

**Manual way:** In [Session Replay](https://app.posthog.com/replay), click **Show filters** → **Filter for events or actions** → select the last event users completed before dropping off. ([Session replay filtering guide](https://posthog.com/tutorials/filter-session-recordings))

If you saved a cohort in Step 4, you can filter replays by that cohort directly.

</details>

By the end of Step 5, you should be able to say "Users drop off here because *[this thing]* keeps happening."

## Step 6: Fold in survey data *(optional, but recommended)*

This step isn't required, but it can be the difference between a good fix and the right fix.

### Exit survey (for users who drop off)

Trigger this when users are about to abandon your onboarding flow:
- **Question:** "What's stopping you from finishing setup?" (open text)
- **Display conditions:** Show on your onboarding URL + after 30–60 seconds of inactivity, or on exit intent

You likely won't get a ton of responses, but the ones you do get can be really useful signals.

### Completion survey (for users who made it)

Survey users who did complete onboarding to understand what almost stopped them:
- "What was the hardest part of getting started?"
- "What, if anything, almost made you give up?"

Trigger this right after your activation event fires; they'll remember while it's fresh.

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

Go to [Surveys](https://app.posthog.com/surveys) → [**New survey**](https://posthog.com/docs/surveys/creating-surveys).

You can set display conditions based on URL, user properties, or events. For the completion survey, trigger it when your activation event fires.

</details>

## Step 7: Form a hypothesis and ship a fix

By now you should have:
- Quantitative data on where users drop off (funnel)
- Behavioral data on what they were doing (replays)
- Direct feedback on what they were thinking (surveys)

Mix these into a hypothesis: "[These] Users are dropping off at [step] because [reason]."

Some common fixes:
- **Simplify your flow** – reduce fields, remove friction, break it into smaller steps, make a required field optional
- **Add guidance** – tooltips, progress indicators, inline help
- **Squash any bugs** – if replays showed errors, fix them
- **Reorder the flow** – maybe you're asking for too much too soon

Make one change at a time. If you change five things, you won't know what helped.

## Step 8: Taste before serving *(optional, but recommended)*

Whatever the change, don't dump it straight into production, roll it out gradually if you can [**using feature flags**](https://posthog.com/blog/best-open-source-feature-flag-tools).

Feature flags let you:
- Release to 10–20% of users first, then ramp up
- Target specific user segments (e.g., new users only)
- Kill the change instantly if something goes wrong

Want statistical proof it worked? [Run an A/B experiment](https://posthog.com/product-engineers/how-to-do-ab-testing). This is optional, [not every fix needs one](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/ab-testing-mistakes-i-learned-the). But it's worth it when:
- The change is significant (like a full flow redesign)
- You're debating between multiple solutions
- You need to convince stakeholders with data

While step isn't mandatory, [it helps avoid "we think this worked" decisions](https://posthog.com/newsletter/what-we've-learned-about-ab-testing).

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

Use [feature flags](https://posthog.com/docs/feature-flags) to roll out your fix to a percentage of users first.

To run an experiment, go to [Experiments](https://app.posthog.com/experiments) → [**New experiment**](https://posthog.com/docs/experiments/creating-an-experiment). Use your feature flag as the basis – PostHog will split users into control and test groups and track your funnel as the goal metric.

</details>

## Step 9: Measure the improvement

After your fix has been live for a bit:
- Go back to your funnel
- Compare conversion rates before and after your change (most analytics tools let you view trends over time)
- Watch a few new replays to confirm the friction is gone

Things to check:
- Did funnel completion improve?
- Did drop-off move to a different step?
- Do replays show smoother behavior?

If it worked: congrats, you've improved activation!

If it didn't, that's okay. Go back to Step 4 with a new hypothesis. Onboarding optimization is iterative, you're rarely done after one fix.

<details>
<summary><strong>If using PostHog</strong></summary>

Set your funnel's Graph type to Historical trends to see conversion over time.

If you used a feature flag or experiment, check the results in [Experiments](https://app.posthog.com/experiments) to see the impact with statistical significance.

</details>

## Chef's notes

**On sample size:** Don't make decisions based on 50 users. Wait for statistical significance, or at least a few hundred users through each step.

**On funnel scope:** Start with your core flow. Once it's optimized, create separate funnels for specific segments (by plan, referral source, etc.).

**On watching successful users too:** Don't just watch drop-offs. Sometimes successful users struggled through the same friction, they just pushed through anyway.

**On iteration:** Most teams don't nail this on the first try. That's fine. The goal is to get a little better each cycle.

## Why this recipe works especially well with PostHog

Most teams piece this workflow together across 3–4 different tools: analytics in one place, replays in another, surveys or feature flags somewhere else. It works, but it's slow and you lose context switching between tabs.

With PostHog, everything's connected in one place:
- Funnels show you where users drop off
- Breakdowns show you who's struggling
- Session replay shows you why
- Surveys tell you what users were thinking
- Feature flags let you ship fixes safely
- Experiments confirm whether the fix actually worked

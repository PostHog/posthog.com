I shouldn't be embarrassed to admit that I have an exec coach, but here we are.

After a few months of a call every couple of weeks, my cofounder and I were in San Francisco so we met our coach together for dinner. The restaurant was dark and expensive. We weren't sure who was going to get the bill.

Amongst other things, one reason we'd met was that we wanted to get a grade. He knows us very well, and he has worked closely with many more-successful founders than us that you'll have heard of. How did he think we're doing?

The answer he gave really surprised us. He was confident in us because:

"The founders that _really_ make it, build a company they like".

Simple, obvious and not something we'd ever considered much before.

So, what's the list of stuff?

## The people we work with

This is 95% of it.

We hire people that are scrappy, proactive, fast, optimistic, low ego and in nearly every role, technical.

... and we optimize the company for them. Having and maintaining a high bar is very important if you want a smaller group of stronger people - which I think is critical if you're shipping a very technically demanding product. The first thing to avoid is being slow at letting people go. In many companies, 80% of the management energy goes into the 20% of the team that are underperforming. The cycle looks like this:

1. Someone is struggling to perform
2. Manager starts to micromanage them
3. Things get worse, the wider team starts getting frustrated, months are spent trying to improve performance and not focused on the product
4. The relevant person gets fired, not much got done and everyone has lost a lot of energy

Instead of going through this cycle, but to be as kind as we can whilst we're at it - ie we offer 4 months' severance.

Pay matters too - we have a system for this (INSERT LINK), aim to pay generously, provide kind terms around options, and we have a very rational system for paying people. We review pay _proactively_ and _frequently_ as we don't want to reward people that complain - we want to reward people who are improving, hopefully as a pleasant surprise (we even scrapped performance reviews since these felt high stress and like the "one shot" to get a rise each year). With pay, as a founder, you are by default between a rock and a hard place (if we pay too much we'll run out of cash, but everyone wants to get paid more), so being very thoughtful up front here can remove a huge amount of negativity.

## Avoid dealing with customers that are a pain to deal with

We're well on our way to $10M ARR. We don't do any outbound - that means we aren't spending a ton of time dealing with people that aren't very interested in us.

Second, we pivoted many times before we built PostHog. We realized we wanted to work with technical people. That came down to our personalities.


## Embracing word of mouth growth is often just nice

This means handling customers really nicely is key, which is enjoyable. We'll refund customers who make mistakes. We won't try to mislead or needlessly upsell people. We'll send folks to competitors if we aren't the right fit. These decisions all hurt us in the short run but benefit us in the long run. 

It also means shipping just plain cool stuff. You grow word of mouthn the fastest by providing a _remarkable_ experience, and building a remarkable experience is a lot of fun. That's more than just the platform we provide - it means having a website (for example, our public handbook, or ridiculously good careers pages) and go to market that we're proud of (actually interesting content, having transparent pricing, having engineers as our salespeople, only doing inbound).


## See each other in real life

We're an all remote company and we think we've overindexed on this before. We find time to hang out. We don't always need a specific reason to do this other than it's fun.

There are a few ways we do this:

* No approval needed $500/month travel budgets for everyone
* Work closely with a small team. It's unrealistic to be buddies with 38 people. It _is_ with the handful you work with closely.


## Break traditional 1/1 rules in places

Conventional wisdom, more or less, is that 1/1 meetings are a place to exchange information, discuss “thorny” issues, uncover problems and review important but not urgent items. They aren't "supposed" to be where you discuss prioritization / the specific work taking place.

The first set of things matter, but we think discussing the actual work together (why or how it's being done / what got done), is great in a remote environment. There simply isn't an easy opportunity otherwise


## Swap your roles around and work on things you want to work on

## Be flexible

We move deadlines around. We stop work on new shiny stuff and remove the pressure if it becomes obvious the product is getting too buggy. We don't stigmatise changing the goalposts.

## Be _reasonably_ thrifty

## Don't have a big team

## Be nice to customers

## Work with the type of users you want to work with

* Have quite a lot of capital

* Build something you're proud of

Working in public forces this.

* Be default alive or profitable

It's a lot more fun sweating product details rather than financial ones.

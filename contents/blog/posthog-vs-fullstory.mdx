PostHog and FullStory are both popular tools for understanding user behavior, but how are they different? Here’s the short answer.

-   **PostHog** is an all-in-one developer platform built to help engineers build successful products. It offers a wide range of features to help teams build better products, including analytics, feature flags, session replays, and more.

-   **FullStory** is primarily a session replay tool focused on helping product managers and UX specialists to understand more about how their users interact with product UI.

In this comparison, we'll explore, compare and contrast PostHog and FullStory in detail, so you can decide which tool is right for you. We’ll look at areas such as...

-   [Core features and product focus](#core-feature-comparison)
-   [Product analytics](#product-analytics), [Session replay](#session-replays), and [Heatmapping](#heatmaps-clickmaps-and-scrollmaps) features
-   [Integrations with other software](#apps-integrations-and-plugins)

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. PostHog is an all-in-one developer platform

FullStory includes a few additional features, but it's mostly focused on session replay. In contrast, PostHog is a comprehensive, all-in-one platform that easily replaces an entire stack of traditional tools, such as [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude), and FullStory.

### 2. PostHog is for engineers, technical users, _builders_

PostHog is designed from the ground up to meet the needs of developers, and product-focused engineers. Session replay includes advanced tools for debugging errors and performance issues, while feature flags make it easy to test, and roll out, new features at scale

### 3. PostHog is open source

As an open source company, we build in public and give you unrivalled access. You can check out the PostHog repo to monitor code changes, build your own features and apps, and interact directly with our engineering team.

### Product Analytics

FullStory is aimed at UI designers and general product managers, while PostHog is suited to product engineers, front-end developers and more technical users. As a result, PostHog offers a wider range of analytics tools, including [its own SQL dialect for detailed analysis](/docs/sql).

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'fullstory']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.features.custom_events',
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'dashboards',
        'product_analytics.funnels.features.correlation_analysis',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'product_analytics.lifecycle',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        'product_analytics.stickiness',
        'product_analytics.user_paths',
    ]}
/>

Product analytics in PostHog is closely integrated with other tools, such as feature flags and session replays.

This means you can use a Trends insight to examine the performance of a particular metric, click on a point in the graph to see users who contributed to it, and then jump directly to their session replay to see what they did.

You can also do this in reverse by filtering for session replays where particular events occur, and creating dynamic playlists. We cover these session replay features in greater depth below.

### Session replay

FullStory is _primarily_ a session replay tool, while PostHog is an all-in-one platform. FullStory's specialism means it has some extra features compared to Posthog, though the gap isn’t as large as you may imagine... and it's closing fast.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'fullstory']}
    rows={[
        'session_replay.platform_support.features.ios_recordings',
        'session_replay.platform_support.features.android_recordings',
        'session_replay.platform_support.features.web_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.ai.features.ai_summaries',
        'session_replay.privacy.features.privacy_masking',
        'session_replay.targeting.features.conditional_recording',
        'session_replay.analysis.features.performance_monitoring',
        'session_replay.organization.features.playlists',
        'session_replay.organization.features.share_replays',
        'session_replay.organization.features.notes_on_replays',
        'session_replay.analysis.features.dom_explorer',
        'session_replay.export.features.export_to_json',
        'session_replay.export.features.retention_policy',
        { label: 'Free tier', values: ['5,000 sessions/mo', '30,000 sessions/mo**'] },
    ]}
/>

<div>
    <sup>*</sup> Data retention increases on more expensive plans.
    <br />
    <sup>**</sup> FullStory offers a 30,000 sessions per month free tier with 12 month retention, but limited features.
</div>

Beyond this, PostHog and FullStory are roughly comparable even in spite of FullStory’s near-exclusive focus on session replays as a feature.

### Heatmaps, clickmaps and scrollmaps

Different types of heatmaps enable you to see where users are focusing their attention – or even precisely where they are looking on a page.

    competitors={['posthog', 'fullstory']}
    rows={['heatmaps.features.clickmaps', 'heatmaps.features.scrollmaps', 'heatmaps.features.movement_maps']}
/>

### Apps, integrations and plugins

Apps are a major point of difference between FullStory and PosthHog because PostHog offers the ability to inject code into your site. We use this functionality for our [surveys](/docs/surveys/manual) feature, which enables you to ask users for qualitative feedback, to schedule face to face interviews, and more.

PostHog is also open source, meaning [you can easily create your own apps](/tutorials/build-your-own-posthog-app). In fact, it’s so easy to create apps in PostHog that some of the apps we already offer have been developed by non-engineers!

Below are some of the most popular apps and integrations for FullStory and PostHog:

    ]}

## Event tracking

Both PostHog and FullStory support a broad range of tracking options and libraries, and manual event instrumentation, as well as autocapture.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'fullstory']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.features.autocapture',
        'product_analytics.features.actions',
        'platform.deployment.reverse_proxy',
        'platform.developer.cross_domain_tracking',
        'platform.developer.server_side_sdks',
        'platform.developer.api',
    ]}
/>

> #### Should you autocapture events?
>
> Autocapture is much faster to set up than manual instrumentation, but some argue that it creates too much noise to be useful. We disagree, and it’s why PostHog gives you your first million events for free, every month – so you can capture events without worrying about event limits. [It’s something we feel strongly about](/blog/is-autocapture-still-bad).

## Frequently asked questions

### How much do PostHog and FullStory cost?

Both PostHog and FullStory offer three main pricing tiers, but how these tiers differ is actually quite different.

**PostHog** has a free tier with a limited feature set and a generous allowance of 1 million free events and 5,000 free sessions each month, after which users move to a more full-featured paid plan that's billed on usage. The third tier is an enterprise add-on, which expands the feature set further with the permissioning and privacy tools needed by large organizations.

> See [PostHog’s pricing page](/pricing) to find out more about what’s included in each tier.

**FullStory** has a free tier and then three premium, paid-for tiers, which differ in available features. The Business, Advanced, and Enterprise plans increase the feature scope and, presumably, cost.

We say 'presumably' because FullStory’s pricing isn’t transparent and there’s no way to know exactly how much each tier costs. In contrast, PostHog's pricing is completely transparent – we have a cost calculator on [our pricing page](/pricing) and you can set billing limits to prevent surprise bills.

#### Do PostHog and FullStory offer free trials?

It doesn’t cost anything to get started with PostHog, and every month we give users their first million events _and_ their first 5,000 sessions for free. As a result, there’s no need for a free trial — you can get started, start tracking and use billing limits to stay within the free allowance. Forever.

FullStory offers a 14-day free trial which is limited to 5,000 sessions. After this, it defaults to a premium Business plan.

#### Does session replay capture personal information?

Both PostHog and FullStory offer privacy masking to automatically remove text field input from session replays, as well as more advanced controls to further protect user privacy.

#### What are the alternatives to PostHog and FullStory?

Some other popular session replay tools include [HotJar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) and [LogRocket](/blog/posthog-vs-logrocket). For a full breakdown of the top session replay platforms, see our guide to the [best session replay tools for developers](/blog/best-session-replay-tools).

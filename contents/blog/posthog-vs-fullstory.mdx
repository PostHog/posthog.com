PostHog and FullStory are both popular tools for understanding user behavior, but how are they different? Here’s the short answer.

- **PostHog** is an all-in-one product improvement platform built primarily for engineers and technical users. It offers a wide range of features to help teams build better products, including analytics, feature flags, session replays, and more.

- **FullStory** is primarily a session replay tool focused on helping product managers and UX specialists to understand more about how their users interact with product UI. 

In this comparison, we'll explore, compare and contrast PostHog and FullStory in detail, so you can decide which tool is right for you. We’ll look at areas such as...

- [Core features and product focus](#core-feature-comparison)
- [Product analytics](#product-analytics), [Session replay](#session-replays), and [Heatmapping](#heatmaps-clickmaps-and-scrollmaps) features
- [Integrations with other software](#apps-integrations-and-plugins)
- [Event tracking and data management](#event-tracking)
- [Privacy, security and compliance](#security-and-compliance) 
- [Pricing and frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)

## How is PostHog different?

#### 1. PostHog is an all-in-one product improvement platform
FullStory includes a few additional features, but it's mostly focused on session replay. In contrast, PostHog is a comprehensive, all-in-one platform that easily replaces an entire stack of traditional tools, such as [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude), and FullStory.  

#### 2. PostHog is for engineers, technical users, _builders_
PostHog is designed from the ground up to meet the needs of developers, and product-focused engineers. Session replay includes advanced tools for debugging errors and performance issues, while feature flags make it easy to test, and roll out, new features at scale 

#### 3. PostHog is open source
As an open source company, we build in public and give you unrivalled access. You can check out the PostHog repo to monitor code changes, build your own features and apps, and interact directly with our engineering team.

### Product Analytics

FullStory is aimed at UI designers and general product managers, while PostHog is suited to product engineers, front-end developers and more technical users. As a result, PostHog offers a wider range of analytics tools, including [its own SQL dialect for detailed analysis](/docs/product-analytics/hogql).

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="FullStory">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Event tracking" description="Log page views, clicks and other custom events." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Trends" description="Track your data over time and visualize in charts." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Funnels" description="Visualize conversion rates and drop-offs." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Display a collection of insights and trends." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Automatically highlight factors affecting funnel conversion rates." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Group analytics" description="Group events by users in the same company, project, or any other attribute." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Lifecycle insights" description="Break down events from new, returning, resurrecting, and dormant users." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Retention insights" description="Understand churn with returning user actions." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Stickiness insights" description="See how many times users perform an event in a period of time." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Path insights" description="Inspect how users journey through your product." />
</ComparisonTable>

Product analytics in PostHog is closely integrated with other tools, such as feature flags and session replays. 

This means you can use a Trends insight to examine the performance of a particular metric, click on a point in the graph to see users who contributed to it, and then jump directly to their session replay to see what they did.

You can also do this in reverse by filtering for session replays where particular events occur, and creating dynamic playlists. We cover these session replay features in greater depth below. 

> **PostHog ships weirdly fast.** We never stop shipping. Visit the [the weekly changelog](/changelog/2023) to keep up to date, or take a look at what we’re planning in [our public roadmap](/roadmap)!

### Session replay

FullStory is _primarily_ a session replay tool, while PostHog is all-in-one platform. FullStory's specialism means it has some extra features compared to Posthog, though the gap isn’t as large as you may imagine... and it's closing fast.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="FullStory">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="iOS app replays" description="Record user sessions in iOS apps." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Android app replays" description="Record user sessions in Android apps" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web app replays" description="Capture replays from single-page apps" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Privacy masking" description="Avoid capturing user data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Conditional capturing" description="Only capture the sessions you want" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Performance monitoring" description="Monitor network activity and performance." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Custom playlists" description="Create playlists of related replays" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Share replays" description="Generate timestamped short links for sharing" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Add notes to replays" description="Add notes to a timebar when sharing" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="DOM explorer" description="Explore an interactive snapshot of replays" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Export replays" description="Save replay files offline for storage." />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Up to 3 months" column2="1 month*" feature="Data retention" description="" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="5,000 sessions every month" column2="No free allowance**" feature="Free replay allowance" />
</ComparisonTable>

<sup>*</sup> Data retention increases on more expensive plans.
<sup>**</sup> FullStory offers a 14-day trial with 5,000 free sessions before forcing you to pay.

Beyond this, PostHog and FullStory are roughly comparable even in spite of FullStory’s near-exclusive focus on session replays as a feature. A major exception is PostHog’s lack of mobile app recording features, but [we’re working on it](/roadmap).

### Heatmaps, clickmaps and scrollmaps
Different types of heatmaps enable you to see where users are focusing their attention – or even precisely where they are looking on a page.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="FullStory">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Clickmaps" description="Visualize where users click on a page" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Scrollmaps" description="Check where users scroll to" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Movement maps" description="Visualize mouse movements" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Apps, integrations and plugins
Apps are a major point of difference between FullStory and PosthHog because PostHog offers the ability to inject code into your site. We use this functionality for our [surveys](/docs/surveys/manual) feature, which enables you to ask users for qualitative feedback, to schedule face to face interviews, and more.

PostHog is also open source, meaning [you can easily create your own apps](/tutorials/build-your-own-posthog-app). In fact, it’s so easy to create apps in PostHog that some of the apps we already offer have been developed by non-engineers! 

Below are some of the most popular apps and integrations for FullStory and PostHog:

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Rudderstack" description="Sync event and person data" />
</ComparisonTable>

## Event tracking

Both PostHog and FullStory support a broad range of tracking options and libraries, and manual event instrumentation, as well as autocapture.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="FullStory">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Automatically track events without instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Combined events" description="Track related events as a single trackable action or behavior" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Reverse proxy available" description="Send events from your own domain to capture more data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cross-domain tracking" description="Track users across domains and sub-domains" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Server-side tracking" description="Send events from your server" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Capture APi" description="Send events through an API" />
</ComparisonTable>

> #### Should you autocapture events?
>
> Autocapture is much faster to setup than manual instrumentation, but some argue that it creates too much noise to be useful. We disagree, and it’s why PostHog gives you your first million events for free, every month – so you can capture events without worrying about event limits. [It’s something we feel strongly about](/blog/is-autocapture-still-bad).

## Frequently asked questions

### How much do PostHog and FullStory cost?
Both PostHog and FullStory offer three main pricing tiers, but how these tiers differ is actually quite different. 

**PostHog** has a free tier with a limited feature set and a generous allowance of 1 million free events and 5,000 free sessions each month, after which users move to a more full-featured paid plan that's billed on usage. The third tier is an enterprise add-on, which expands the feature set further with the permissioning and privacy tools needed by large organizations.

>  See [PostHog’s pricing page](/pricing) to find out more about what’s included in each tier.

**FullStory** has three premium, paid-for tiers, which differ in available features. The basic Business plan offers minimal features and a limited 14-day trial, while the following Advanced and Enterprise plans increase the feature scope and, presumably, cost. 

We say 'presumably' because FullStory’s pricing isn’t transparent and there’s no way to know exactly how much each tier costs. In contrast, PostHog's pricing is completely transparent – we have a cost calculator on [our pricing page](/pricing) and you can set billing limits to prevent surprise bills.

#### Do PostHog and FullStory offer free trials?

It doesn’t cost anything to get started with PostHog, and every month we give user their first million events _and_ their first 5,000 sessions for free. As a result, there’s no need for a free trial — you can get started, start tracking and use billing limits to stay within the free allowance. Forever. 

FullStory offers a 14-day free trial which is limited to 5,000 sessions. After this, it defaults to a premium Business plan. 

#### Does session replay capture personal information?

Both PostHog and FullStory offer privacy masking to automatically remove text field input from session replays, as well as more advanced controls to further protect user privacy. 

#### What are the alternatives to PostHog and FullStory?

Some other popular session replay tools include [HotJar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) and [LogRocket](/blog/posthog-vs-logrocket). For more information on how PostHog compares to these, check [the session replay page](/session-replay).

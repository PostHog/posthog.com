In this edition of the PostHog Array: Release 1.23 is out, and our 🔥 new [PostHog.com homepage](/) is live - amazing work from PostHoggers Cory, Lottie, and Mike!

### Community MVP

The PostHog 1.23.0 community MVP is Sandeep ([samcaspus](https://github.com/samcaspus)) - a frequent contributor to PostHog. If you open a new issue, there's a high change Sandeep will jump on it!

Anyone can contribute to PostHog and open source, whether it's code, copy, design or discussion. We're delighted that our community are so passionate that they even [share PostHog with their family](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/1036#issuecomment-788732593) ;)

Thank you Sandeep, we look forward to collaborating with you more!

## Important Announcement for Self-Hosted Users

If you're self hosting PostHog, make sure you have your app server up and running by looking at the color of the middle circle on the top left of the PostHog UI.

If it is running, you'll see a green checkmark, and hovering over it will give the message "All systems operational", like so:

![App server](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/plugin-server.png)

From this release (1.23.0) onwards, you **will not be able to ingest events** if your app server isn't running.

### Special Note for CloudFormation Deployments

If you've deployed PostHog via CloudFormation, make sure to check your memory limits, as they may be set too low by default (512MB).

To run the server, we recommend having _at least_ 1024MB of memory, or you might run the risk of running out of it.

## PostHog 1.23.0 Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

### [Date Filter for Heatmaps](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3586)

![Toolbar Date Filter](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/toolbar-date.png)

Following a fierce battle with Webpack, Marius developed our new Heatmap date filters allowing you to now select any date range rather than been fixed to only the last week.

### [Automatic Filtering of Test Accounts](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3492)

![Filter test accounts](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/filter-test-accounts.png)

Have you ever wondered what effect your team's usage is having on your analytics data? Well your wondering days are over. You can now toggle events from internal accounts to be automatic filtered out when viewing Insights. We've provided some convenient filtering defaults, which can customized further in 'Settings'.

### [Webhooks Are Back - And They're Better](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+webhook)

![Webhooks](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/webhooks.png)

We made a big improvement to webhooks, you can now access all event properties in your webhook messages. This change opens up a whole new world of possibilities for creating useful alerts and notifications.

A big thank you to diligent members of our community who reported and helped us debug and fix issues with webhooks on certain self-hosted FOSS setups.

### [Organization Settings & Gravatar Support](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3584)

![Gravatars](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/gravatar.png)

We've added an 'Organization Settings' page that lets you rename and delete your organization, as well as manage invites.

If you have a Gravatar associated with your email, PostHog will now display it on your profile and the 'Organization Settings' page.

### First Time Event Tracker

![](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/first-time-plugin.png)

Based on user requests, we have now built a app that adds two boolean properties to your events:

-   `is_event_first_ever`: tells you if the event if the first event of its kind
-   `is_event_first_for_user`: tells you if the event is the first event of its kind for the user

By enabling the app, you can filter for those properties on all your analytics, to determine things like conversion rates from first touch.

> **Important:** This app will only work on events ingested after the app was enabled. This means it will register events as being the first if there were events that occurred before it was enabled.

### [User Interviews](https://calendly.com/posthog-feedback)

Oh, and we're giving away some awesome [PostHog merch](https://merch.posthog.com) as a thank you!

## 1. PostHog

- **Founded:** 2020
- **Similar to:** Statsig, Amplitude
- **Typical users:** Engineers and product teams

![PostHog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/feature-flags.png)

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an open-source platform combining feature flags, A/B testing, product analytics, session replay, and surveys into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to Eppo, but also tools like [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar).

Typical PostHog users are engineers and product managers at startups and mid-size companies, particularly B2B companies. Customers include [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai), [Hasura](/customers/hasura), [Vendasta](/customers/vendasta), and Airbus.

#### Key features

- 🚩 **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Experiment in your app with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Auto-calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Eppo?

Both Eppo and PostHog support core feature flag and A/B testing components. The biggest difference is their approach to data warehouses:

- Eppo is warehouse-native, meaning that it integrates with your existing data tools like Snowflake or Postgres. 

- PostHog is not warehouse-native, but instead aims to replace your existing data stack by combining product analytics, [pipelines](/docs/cdp), and warehousing into one platform. This eliminates the need for stitching together integrations between third-party tools, and makes it easier for engineers to work with data. 

Besides this, PostHog offers product analytics, session replays, and surveys, whereas Eppo does not. On the other hand, Eppo offers multi-armed bandit testing (called "contextual bandits" in Eppo) and [CUPED analysis](https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/cuped/), whereas PostHog does not.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It's many tools in one:** PostHog can replace Eppo (feature flags and A/B testing), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (analytics), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and build better products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

3. **It's easy to get started:** Many users love how PostHog's event autocapture means they can go from implementing its tracking code to ingesting events in just a few minutes. Enabling session replay is equally straightforward, so you can instantly start seeing how people are navigating your app or website.

> #### Bottom line
> 
> PostHog is an ideal Eppo alternative if you're looking for a powerful all-in-one tool that can also serve your A/B testing and feature flag needs. It also offers a dedicated EU-hosted cloud at no extra cost.

PostHog and Statsig both offer A/B testing and feature flags, but they're different in two important ways:

- **Statsig** is a dedicated testing platform that offers advanced statistical methods for running tests. It's ideal for data scientists and growth teams in large enterprises who need to conduct complex A/B testing.

- **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform for engineers and product teams who want a more straightforward approach to experimentation. In addition to A/B testing, it offers [feature flags](/feature-flags), advanced [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replays](/docs/session-replay), [surveys](/surveys), and more.

This post compares their platforms, experimentation features, pricing, and more.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. We're an all-in-one platform

PostHog brings together all the tools engineers need for testing, releasing, and measuring the success of new features. Feature flags and A/B testing are only part of a suite of tools PostHog offers.

![PostHog homepage features](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/posthog-vs-statsig/all.png)

PostHog combines usage, performance, and [behavioral data](/product-engineers/behavioral-analytics) with flags and experiments. Having all these product and data tools together enables you to do better analysis of shipped features and make better decisions about what you are building next. 

### 2. We're open source and transparent

PostHog is built with transparency at its core. Not only do we work in the open and give full access to [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), we also enable others to [build integrations](/docs/apps/build) or [other services on top of PostHog](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server), open their own PRs, or give feedback on [our roadmap](/roadmap). PostHog's open app framework makes it easy to integrate internal tools, an advantage closed-source products like Statsig can't offer.

### 3. We ship weirdly fast

We update [our changelog](/changelog) with a recap of new features every week, and often there’s even more in beta testing. We work hard to keep PostHog on the cutting edge and respond quickly to feedback from our users.

## Comparing PostHog and Statsig

        { label: 'Mobile session replays', description: 'Watch real users use your native mobile app', customValue: false },
        'surveys',

        'platform.deployment.open_source',
        { label: 'Data warehouse experiments', description: 'Run A/B tests natively on data in your existing warehouse', customValue: 'Beta' },
    ]}
/>

### Experimentation

Both tools enable you to run [A/B/n](/tutorials/abn-testing) and [multivariate](/product-engineers/what-is-multivariate-testing-examples) tests, set custom goals, and calculate statistical significance, but:

- **Statsig** offers some more advanced testing techniques, such as multi-armed bandit, mutually exclusive, and holdout tests. It also lets you choose between Bayesian and Frequentist engines, and supports Bonferroni correction.

- **PostHog** provides a more intuitive user interface and simpler setup process, making it ideal for teams who prefer a more straightforward approach to experimentation, and tight integration with its other powerful tools.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'statsig']}
    rows={[
        'experiments.features.custom_goals',
        'experiments.features.secondary_metrics',
        'experiments.features.statistical_significance',
        { label: 'Split testing', description: 'Split participants into groups', customValue: true },
        'experiments.features.multivariate_testing',
        { label: 'Recommended run time', description: 'Calculate the recommended run time for your experiments', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Statistics engine', description: 'How the results of an experiment are calculated', customValue: 'Bayesian' },
        { label: 'Holdout testing', description: 'Withhold multiple features to measure cumulative impact', customValue: 'Partial' },
        { label: 'Multi-armed bandit', description: 'Optimize tests automatically by allocating traffic to the best performing variant.', customValue: false },
        { label: 'Mutually exclusive experiments', description: 'Isolate user groups for simultaneous, independent experiments', customValue: false },
        { label: 'Bonferroni correction', description: 'Includes α correction when tests are being performed simultaneously', customValue: false },
    ]}
/>

- **Holdout testing:** It's possible to run a [holdout test](/tutorials/holdout-testing) across multiple A/B tests in PostHog. However, the process is more manual than Statsig's, which has built-in functionality to do this.
  
### Feature management

While both offer the core features you need, Statsig's feature flags are boolean-based, while PostHog supports [multivariate flags with JSON payloads](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags#served-value) _and_ boolean flags. This provides greater flexibility in testing and deploying different variations of a feature, making them more suitable for complex rollouts.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'statsig']}
    rows={[
        'feature_flags.features.boolean_flags',
        { label: 'Multivariate flags', description: 'Flags with multiple customizable values', customValue: false },
        { label: 'Payloads', description: 'Flags with string, number, or JSON payloads', customValue: false },
        'feature_flags.features.percentage_rollouts',
        'feature_flags.features.custom_targeting',
        { label: 'Scheduling', description: 'Schedule flags to turn on or off', customValue: true },

        { label: 'Bootstrapping', description: 'Flags available on frontend application load', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Early access management', description: 'Manage betas, test features', customValue: false },
    ]}
/>

### Product analytics

Both PostHog and Statsig offer the functionality you expect from product analytics tools, such as dashboards, graphs, and funnels. However:

- **PostHog** provides deep insights into how users are interacting with your product. It includes features such as lifecycle, stickiness, correlation, and retention analysis.

- **Statsig** does provide some additional insights, such as retention analysis, but its main focus is to use product analytics to set up metrics to run A/B tests on. 

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'statsig']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.features.autocapture',
        'dashboards',
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'product_analytics.features.cohorts',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        'product_analytics.user_paths',
        'product_analytics.funnels.features.correlation_analysis',
        { label: 'Lifecycle analysis', description: 'Understand who is dormant, churning, and thriving', customValue: false },
        { label: 'Stickiness insights', description: 'See how many times users perform an event in a period of time.', customValue: false },
        'product_analytics.insights.features.formula_mode',
        'product_analytics.insights.features.sql_editor',
    ]}
/>

### Integrations

Both PostHog and Statsig have a range of integrations that enable them to import, export, enhance, and make use of data, but PostHog being open source means you can [create your own integration](/docs/apps/build).

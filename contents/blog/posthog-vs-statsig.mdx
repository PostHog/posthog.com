Statsig better for growth teams. 

PostHog and Statsig both offer A/B testing, feature flags, and product analytics, but they're different in two important ways:

- **Statsig** offers advance experimentation tools, such as multi-armed bandit, holdout testing

It offers advanced experimentation techniques, such as multi-armed bandit experiments and [holdout testing](/tutorials/holdout-testing), making it well suited for growth teams in startups.

has advanced data features, for users with heavy statisfical background. PostHog for most users 

But how are they different? If you remember nothing else, remember these two points:

1. LaunchDarkly only does feature flags and experiments.

2. PostHog is an all-in-one platform that does flags, experiments and a whole bunch more, including analytics, session replays, and user surveys.

In this post, we'll cover these differences in more detail, comparing features, pricing, reporting, integrations, and frequently asked questions about both.

PostHog and GrowthBook both provide open source, self-serve feature flags and experimentation, but they're different in two important ways:

- GrowthBook is a warehouse-native feature flag and experiments platform. It focuses on integrating with the product and data tools you already use.

- PostHog is an all-in-one product and data platform. Beyond [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags) and [experiments](/docs/experiments), it includes [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics), [session replay](/docs/session-replay), [surveys](/docs/surveys), [CDP](/docs/cdp), and more.

In this post, we'll cover these differences in more detail, and answer frequently asked questions about both tools.


## How is PostHog different?

### 1. It is an all-in-one platform

PostHog includes all the tools product teams need to test, release, and measure the success of new features. Beyond the [feature flag](/docs/feature-flags) and [A/B testing](/docs/experiments) tools, this includes product analytics, [session replays](/docs/session-replay), [surveys](/docs/surveys), and more.

![All in one](../images/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly/all.png)

These tools add an extra layer of analysis unavailable in LaunchDarkly. They enable you to make better decisions about features you’ve shipped and what you’re building next. They also enable you to combine data from multiple tools, such as user properties from analytics, for use in flags and experiments.

### 2. We’re transparent (in many ways)

PostHog is open source. Our code, culture, and strategy are public [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) and our [handbook](/handbook). While LaunchDarkly open sourced some code (like SDKs), most is closed source.

We're also self-serve. No need to "talk to sales" or "schedule a demo" unless you want to – we're always [happy to chat](/book-a-demo). You can sign up and try all the features PostHog offers for free.

Our [pricing](/pricing) is also transparent. It is a two-tier usage-based model, which we make easy to predict. This is simpler than LaunchDarkly’s multi-tier combination of charging for seats, monthly context instances, and add-ons. If you worry about overages, you can set up billing limits in PostHog too.

Statsig pricing is also transparent - https://statsig.com/pricing
HIPPA eligilbity (enterprise only)

### 3. Built for startups and engineers

PostHog is built for high-growth startups. This means it's simple for engineers to implement themselves. We have many [SDKs](/docs/libraries), [tutorials](/tutorials), and docs to help you get started quickly with any type of app.

After setting up, PostHog aligns with startups as they scale up, providing tools like advanced product analytics, [CDPs](/docs/cdp), and [data warehousing](/docs/data-warehouse) to combine the tools they need into one. 

LaunchDarkly focuses on enterprise users, managers, and DevOps. This means more focus on governance and integrations. 

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. PostHog is an all-in-one platform

PostHog brings together all the tools engineers need for testing, releasing, and measuring the success of new features. Feature flags and A/B testing are only part of a suite of tools PostHog offers.

![PostHog homepage features](../images/blog/posthog-vs-growthbook/build.png)

PostHog combines usage, performance, and behavioral data with flags and experiments. PostHog’s [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) also enables you to pull in data from external sources.

Having all these product and data tools together enables you to do better analysis of shipped features and make better decisions about what you are building next. 

### 2. PostHog is built for startups and engineers

PostHog is built for high-growth startups. This means it is simple for founders and engineers to implement themselves. There are many [SDKs](/docs/libraries), [tutorials](/tutorials), and [docs](/docs) to help you get started quickly with any type of app.

As startups scale, PostHog also provides the more advanced tools they need to succeed. These include advanced product analytics, [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql), [CDPs](/docs/cdp), and [data warehousing](/docs/data-warehouse).

GrowthBook, on the other hand, focuses only on later-stage, larger companies than PostHog. Many of their features, like their analytical A/B testing suite, are great for data teams which also come at a later stage.

### 3. PostHog is easier to setup

GrowthBook requires more setup than PostHog as it relies heavily on external tools and writing SQL:

1. To get data into GrowthBook, you must integrate a data source. 
2. To track data related to flags and experiments, you connect to an analytics tool.
3. To configure data sources and track events, you write SQL configurations in GrowthBook.
4. To set up goals and analysis, you write more SQL.

PostHog needs none of this. You use the same app and SDKs for managing and evaluating feature flags as tracking usage. There is no extra configuration needed. Creating flags, experiments, and insights doesn’t require writing SQL. This makes PostHog faster to get started and easier to use once set up.



## Comparing PostHog and LaunchDarkly

### Platform

Both PostHog and Statsig provide A/B tests, feature flags and analytics. However, PostHog also offers session replays and surveys, while Statsig offers a configurator.

</ComparisonTable>

### Experimentation

Experimentation is where PostHog and Statsig's functionality diverges. Both enable you to create [A/B/n](/tutorials/abn-testing) and [multivariate](/product-engineers/what-is-multivariate-testing-examples) tests with custom goals and calculate statistical significance, but:

- Statsig provides more potential statistical depth, such as Bayesian and Frequentist engines, and Bonferroni correction. It also offers more advanced testing techniques, like multi-armed bandit, mutually, and holdout tests. This makes it well-suited for teams who are expect to run dozens of experiments on the same surface concurrently.

- PostHog provides a more intuitive user interface and simpler setup process – making it ideal for teams who prefer a more straightforward approach to experimentation.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Statsig">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom goals" description="Customize metrics that a test tracks" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Secondary metrics" description="Monitor impact on unrelated metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Statistical significance calculation" description="Calculate if changes make a statistically significant impact" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Recommended run time" description="Calculate the recommended run time for your experiments" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Bayesian" column2="Bayesian, Frequentist" feature="Statistics engine" description="How the results of an experiment are calculated" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Partial" column2={true} feature="Holdout testing" description="Withhold multiple features to measure cumulative impact">
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Multi-armed bandit" description="Optimize tests automatically by allocating traffic to the best performing variant.">
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Mutually exclusive experiments" description="Isolate user groups for simultaneous, independent experiments">
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Bonferroni correction" description="Includes α correction when tests are being performed simultaneously" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **Holdout testing:** It's possible to run a [holdout test](/tutorials/holdout-testing) across multiple A/B tests in PostHog. However, the process is more manual than Statsig's, which has built-in functionality to do this.
  
### Feature management

Both PostHog and LaunchDarkly offer all the functionality you expect for feature management using feature flags. However, a key difference is that Statsig's feature flags are boolean-based. This means that they primarily support simple on/off toggling of features.

On the other hand, in addition to boolean flags, PostHog offers [multivariate flags with JSON payloads](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags#served-value). This provides greater flexibility in testing and deploying different variations of a feature, making them more suitable for complex rollouts.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Statsig">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Boolean flags" description="Simple flags returning true or flag" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Multivariate flags" description="Flags with multiple customizable values" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Payloads" description="Flags with string, number, or JSON payloads" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Percentage rollouts" description="Target percentages of a group" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom targeting" description="Target users based on user properties, custom contexts" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Scheduling" description="Schedule flags to turn on or off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Partial" column2={true} feature="Environments" description="Manage flags for dev, stage, prod" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Bootstrapping" description="Flags available on frontend application load" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Early access management" description="Manage betas, test features" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Product analytics

Both PostHog and Statsig offer the functionality you expect from product analytics tools, such as dashboards, graphs, and funnels. However:

- PostHog provides deep insights into how users are interacting with your product. It includes features such as lifecycle, stickiness, correlation, and retention analysis.

- Statsig does provide some additional insights, such as retention analysis, but its main focus is to use product analytics to set up metrics to run A/B tests on. 

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Statsig">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual logging" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Combine insights into shareable dashboards" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Graphs and trends" description="Build custom insights and visualizations" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cohorts" description="Combine users based on properties and events for group analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Track metrics at a company level" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Funnels" description="Track users through a sequence of events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Retention analysis" description="Visualize which users stay, for how long" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="User paths" description="Track user flows and where they drop-off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Suggested events and properties that lead to success or failure" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Lifecycle analysis" description="Understand who is dormant, churning, and thriving" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Stickiness insights" description="See how many times users perform an event in a period of time." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Formulas" description="Use custom formulas to calculate unique insights" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Query editor" description="Write your own queries in SQL" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Pricing

Both PostHog and Statsig offer simple, transparent pricing.

Statsig has a free plan for up to 1 million "metered events" (a metered event is any feature flag, A/B testing, or logging request or event). Thereafter, it's $150 per month for up to 5 million metered events, and then $50 per every 1 million events thereafter. 

PostHog’s prices A/B testing and feature flags separately from product analytics:

-  [A/B testing and feature flag pricing](/pricing?product=feature-flags) is: 
   -  free up to 1 million requests. 
   - **$0.000100** per request between 1-2 million requests – i.e., $100 for 1 million requests.
   - **$0.000045** from 2-10 million requests – i.e. $45 for 1 million requests
   - Progressively cheaper beyond 10 million requests.

-  [Product analytics pricing](/pricing?product-analytics) is: 
   -  free up to 1 million events. 
   - **$0.00031** per events between 1-2 million events – i.e., $310 for 1 million events.
   - **$0.00013** from 2-15 million events – i.e. $130 for 1 million events
   - Progressively cheaper beyond 15 million events.

So PostHog and Statsig are similarly priced for A/B testing and feature flags, although PostHog is more expensive for product analytics.

</div>

### Integrations

Both PostHog and Statsig have a range of integrations that enable them to import, export, enhance, and make use of data. However, a key difference is that since PostHog is open source, As an open source software, it's possible to [create your own integration](/docs/apps/build).


Below is a sample comparison of PostHog and Statsig's integrations. Be sure to checkout [PostHog's full list of integrations](/cdp).

## Frequently asked questions

### Who is PostHog useful for?

PostHog is built for startups and their engineers. It provides all the tools startups need to build successful products. The people who find PostHog most useful are founders, [product engineers](/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer), and growth engineers.

Companies that use PostHog feature flags and experiments include [Y Combinator](/customers/ycombinator), [Vendasta](/customers/vendasta), and [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai).

### Who is LaunchDarkly useful for?

LaunchDarkly is built for enterprises wanting to follow software development best practices. This means managing features, de-risking releases, experimenting with changes, and coordinating deploys. The people who find LaunchDarkly most useful are engineering managers, site reliability engineers, and product managers.

Companies that use LaunchDarkly include IBM, Atlassian, Bayer, and HP.

### How much does PostHog cost?

Feature flags and experiments are free for up to 1M requests per month. Beyond that, it costs $0.0001/request (or $1 per 10,000 requests). There are discounts for high-volume users, non-profits, and [startups](/startups). 

Other products, like product analytics and session replay, have separate but similarly structured pricing. 

### How much does LaunchDarkly cost?

LaunchDarkly starts at $10 per seat per month. This includes unlimited flags, server-side monthly active users, and 1,000 client-side monthly active users. More client-side monthly active users, also known as monthly context instances, cost more. 

Their pro plan doubles the cost to $20 per seat per month. It adds API, unlimited projects, and more integrations. Above that, their enterprise plan requires talking to sales. It includes custom roles, SSO, scheduling, workflows, and more.

### Does LaunchDarkly or PostHog offer free trials?

LaunchDarkly offers a 14-day free trial, but beyond that, all access and features are paid.

PostHog lets you use all its features for free. Once you upgrade to paid, you get 1M flag requests, 1M events, and 15,000 recordings for free each month. This means if you stay below this, PostHog remains free. 

### How long does it take to implement PostHog?

Feature flags and experiments are simple. They are a few lines of code in all of your favorite languages. They can even be set up on no-code site builders like [Framer](/tutorials/framer-analytics) or [Webflow](/tutorials/webflow-ab-tests).

The process requires signing up for PostHog, installing the snippet or SDK in your app, creating the flag in PostHog, and implementing the flag evaluation and relevant logic in your app. In many of the SDKs, we handle important aspects like local evaluation and event capture for you. 

Much of the PostHog implementation, like user identification, is reused across products. Because PostHog is an all-in-one platform, analytics capture for targeting and A/B testing doesn’t need set up or connection either.

### How long does it take to implement LaunchDarkly?

Installing LaunchDarkly is relatively simple, depending on your needs and compliance requirements. The most basic form is starting your LaunchDarkly trial, installing their SDK, setting up a client or provider, identifying users or contexts, calling flags, and capturing events. 

The differences with PostHog are needing to import user context data, set up context identification, capture the flag or A/B test usage, and import analytics into the platform.

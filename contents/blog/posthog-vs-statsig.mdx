PostHog and Statsig both offer A/B testing and feature flags, but they're different in two important ways:

- **Statsig** offers advance experimentation tools, such as multi-armed bandit and holdout testing. It's ideal for data scientists, product managers, and growth teams who need to conduct complex A/B testing.

- **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform built to help engineers understand users and create better products. Beyond [feature flags](/feature-flags) and [A/B testing](/ab-testing), it includes [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics), [session replay](/docs/session-replay), [surveys](/docs/surveys), and more.

This post compares their platforms, experimentation features, pricing, and more.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. It is an all-in-one platform

PostHog brings together all the tools engineers need for testing, releasing, and measuring the success of new features. Feature flags and A/B testing are only part of a suite of tools PostHog offers.

![PostHog homepage features](../images/blog/posthog-vs-statsig/all.png)

PostHog combines usage, performance, and behavioral data with flags and experiments. PostHog’s [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) also enables you to pull in data from external sources.

Having all these product and data tools together enables you to do better analysis of shipped features and make better decisions about what you are building next. 

### 2. PostHog is built for engineers

Anyone can use PostHog – just [ask our marketing team](/blog/posthog-marketing) – but PostHog is designed to meet the needs of engineers. Our goal is to help developers [be better at product](/blog/helping-engineers-to-product).

### 3. We’re transparent (in many ways)

PostHog is open source. Our code, culture, and strategy are public [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) and our [handbook](/handbook). While Statsig open sourced some code (like SDKs), most is closed source.

We're also self-serve. No need to "talk to sales" or "schedule a demo" unless you want to – we're always [happy to chat](/book-a-demo). You can sign up and try all the features PostHog offers for free.

</ComparisonTable>

### Experimentation

Experimentation is where PostHog and Statsig's functionality diverges. Both enable you to create [A/B/n](/tutorials/abn-testing) and [multivariate](/product-engineers/what-is-multivariate-testing-examples) tests, set custom goals, and calculate statistical significance, but:

- **Statsig** provides more options for statistical depth, such as Bayesian and Frequentist engines, and Bonferroni correction. It also offers advanced testing techniques, like multi-armed bandit, mutually exclusive, and holdout tests. This makes it well-suited for teams who are expect to run dozens of experiments on the same surface concurrently.

- **PostHog** provides a more intuitive user interface and simpler setup process, making it ideal for teams who prefer a more straightforward approach to experimentation.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Statsig">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom goals" description="Customize metrics that a test tracks" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Secondary metrics" description="Monitor impact on unrelated metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Statistical significance calculation" description="Calculate if changes make a statistically significant impact" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Split testing" description="Split participants into groups" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Multivariate (A/B/n) testing" description="Test multiple variants of a change" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Recommended run time" description="Calculate the recommended run time for your experiments" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Bayesian" column2="Bayesian, Frequentist" feature="Statistics engine" description="How the results of an experiment are calculated" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Partial" column2={true} feature="Holdout testing" description="Withhold multiple features to measure cumulative impact" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Multi-armed bandit" description="Optimize tests automatically by allocating traffic to the best performing variant." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Mutually exclusive experiments" description="Isolate user groups for simultaneous, independent experiments" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Bonferroni correction" description="Includes α correction when tests are being performed simultaneously" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **Holdout testing:** It's possible to run a [holdout test](/tutorials/holdout-testing) across multiple A/B tests in PostHog. However, the process is more manual than Statsig's, which has built-in functionality to do this.
  
### Feature management

Both PostHog and Statsig offer most of the functionality you expect for feature management using flags. However, a key difference is that Statsig's feature flags are boolean-based. This means that they primarily support simple on/off toggling of features.

On the other hand, PostHog offers [multivariate flags with JSON payloads](/docs/feature-flags/creating-feature-flags#served-value) (in addition to boolean flags). This provides greater flexibility in testing and deploying different variations of a feature, making them more suitable for complex rollouts.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Statsig">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Boolean flags" description="Simple flags returning true or flag" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Multivariate flags" description="Flags with multiple customizable values" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Payloads" description="Flags with string, number, or JSON payloads" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Percentage rollouts" description="Target percentages of a group" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom targeting" description="Target users based on user properties, custom contexts" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Scheduling" description="Schedule flags to turn on or off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Partial" column2={true} feature="Environments" description="Manage flags for dev, stage, prod" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Bootstrapping" description="Flags available on frontend application load" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Early access management" description="Manage betas, test features" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Product analytics

Both PostHog and Statsig offer the functionality you expect from product analytics tools, such as dashboards, graphs, and funnels. However:

- **PostHog** provides deep insights into how users are interacting with your product. It includes features such as lifecycle, stickiness, correlation, and retention analysis.

- **Statsig** does provide some additional insights, such as retention analysis, but its main focus is to use product analytics to set up metrics to run A/B tests on. 

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Statsig">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual logging" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Combine insights into shareable dashboards" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Graphs and trends" description="Build custom insights and visualizations" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cohorts" description="Combine users based on properties and events for group analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Track metrics at a company level" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Lifecycle analysis" description="Understand who is dormant, churning, and thriving" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Stickiness insights" description="See how many times users perform an event in a period of time." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Formulas" description="Use custom formulas to calculate unique insights" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Query editor" description="Write your own queries in SQL" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Pricing

Both PostHog and Statsig offer simple, transparent pricing.

**Statsig** has a free plan for up to 1 million *metered events* (a metered event is any feature flag, A/B testing, or logging event). Thereafter, it's $150 per month for up to 5 million metered events, and then $50 per every 1 million events. 

![Statsig pricing](../images/blog/posthog-vs-statsig/statsig-price.png)

**PostHog’s** prices A/B testing and feature flags separately from product analytics:

-  [A/B testing and feature flag pricing](/pricing?product=feature-flags) is: 
   -  free up to 1 million requests. 
   - **$0.000100** per request between 1-2 million requests – i.e., $100 for 1 million requests.
   - **$0.000045** from 2-10 million requests – i.e. $45 for 1 million requests
   - Progressively cheaper beyond 10 million requests.

-  [Product analytics pricing](/pricing?product-analytics) is: 
   -  free up to 1 million events. 
   - **$0.00031** per events between 1-2 million events – i.e., $310 for 1 million events.
   - **$0.00013** from 2-15 million events – i.e. $130 for 1 million events
   - Progressively cheaper beyond 15 million events.

So PostHog and Statsig are similarly priced for A/B testing and feature flags, although PostHog is more expensive for product analytics.

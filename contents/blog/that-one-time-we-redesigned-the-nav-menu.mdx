PostHog is best known for our speed of shipping new products and features. In order to do this, it requires a different approach to product development – one where design isn't a dependency.

When I joined PostHog in 2021 as the sole product designer, I had fully expected to work on the product – but <TeamMember name="James Hawkins" photo showOnlyFirstName /> and <TeamMember name="Tim Glaser" photo showOnlyFirstName /> had other ideas. They envisioned the PostHog website being our primary sales channel, so it led to me spending the majority of my 4+ years here on PostHog.com and brand-related projects... and it was one of the best decisions they've ever made.

Looking back, it's incredible to see how our brand (website, writing, transparency, development speed, support experience) has resonated with so many people. And it's _because_ we have a strong brand that it's given us some affordances in the areas where we traditionally haven't been so strong – one of which being the design of our product.

PostHog has recently experienced a growth spurt. We're now at over 100 team members, the majority being product engineers. This means one thing: the speed at which we're shipping new products and features is only increasing.

More small teams means more products, and we're hitting the point they don't all fit in the nav menu. So as we move beyond 10 products and look toward a future where we have 50+ products, we decided it was time to rethink how we navigate PostHog.

This led us to forming the [Developer Experience Team](/teams/developer-experience) late last year, consisting of <TeamMember name="Marius Andra" photo /> one of our early engineers (who has written his own programming language), our new design-oriented front end developer <TeamMember name="Adam Leith" photo />, and <TeamMember name="Cory Watilo">myself</TeamMember>.

This new team set out to solve two things:

1. Make it easier for engineers to build new products on top of PostHog
2. Make the product more personalized, organized, polished, and easier to navigate

## New navigation menu

Our first step was to rethink how the navigation menu works. We've been focusing on four key areas:

1. A nested folder structure to organize everything you create in PostHog
1. Advanced filtering and search
1. Better accessibility and keyboard navigation
1. An expanded sidebar view

### Folders

Folders let you organize anything you create in PostHog in any way that makes sense to you – like by project or team.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={FoldersLight}
    imageDark={FoldersDark}
    caption="Folders let you organize your content in PostHog"
    padding={false}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Folders"
/>

Let's say you were working on a project called "Search UX". It might require a few different things like:

- Custom events to track
- An experiment
- A feature flag
- A dashboard
- Some insights

Until now, every type of content within PostHog lived in its own section. This means to view a dashboard, you'd first have to visit the _Dashboards_ section.

Now you can create a folder and place any type of content inside of it.

<ProductVideo
    videoLight= "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/video/upload/folders_d5371b4acf.mp4" 
    alt="Organizing content in folders" 
    classes="rounded shadow-xl"
    autoPlay={false}
/>

If you have existing data in PostHog, you'll find everything in an _Unfiled_ folder, with each type of content in its own subfolder. We encourage you to start creating folders and organizing your content in a way that makes sense to you.

### Filtering, search, multiselect

You may have spotted some handy filtering and search capabilities. It's not rocket science, but it's everything you'd expect to find. We currently support:

- `user:` like `user:marius`
- `type:` like `type:insight`
- `name:` like `name:marketing`

It even supports negative keywords so you can exclude items that contain a string, like <code class="text-inherit p-1 rounded bg-accent dark:bg-accent-dark border border-light dark:border-dark !text-[13px] whitespace-nowrap">-this</code>. You can also multi-select items for bulk actions.

    imageLight={Filtering}
    caption="Folders let you organize your content in PostHog"
    padding={false}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Folders"
/>

### Accessibility and keyboard navigation

We're also working toward better accessibility and keyboard navigation across the app. You'll now find it much easier to navigate the menus with tabs, arrows, and enter keys.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={Accessibility}

    padding={false}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Folders"
/>

### Expanded view

Since files are now in a sidebar column, some metadata is hidden by default (like who created an item and when it was created). So we added an expanded view that overlays the sidebar on the page to see more details.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={ExpandedLight}
    imageDark={ExpandedDark}
    caption="Folders let you organize your content in PostHog"
    padding={false}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Folders"
/>

## One more thing... shortcuts coming soon!

Until now, the navigation menu has been static. If you only used a handful of PostHog product, too bad! You still had to look at the entire list of products.

We're about to start rolling out customizable shortcuts which will let you pin just about anything to the main sidebar. This includes products, specific product features, folders, or individual items like insights, dashboards, or experiments. This is a great way to keep tabs on what's important to you right now.

Below you'll see the products menu replaced with shortcuts.

    alt="Organizing content in folders" 
    classes="rounded shadow-xl"
    autoPlay={false}
/>

### Products menu

This means that all PostHog products will now live in a searchable submenu, always available directly from the main navigation.

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight={ProductsLight}
    imageDark={ProductsDark}
    caption="Folders let you organize your content in PostHog"
    padding={false}
    classes="rounded"
    alt="Folders"
/>

This new navigation design will be rolling out over the next couple weeks with shortcuts coming soon after.

We hope you enjoy the new experience and find it easier to navigate PostHog. Oh, and in case you're wondering how we're measuring success, it's if we see a drop in tweets about PostHog that mention "clutter" or "messy".

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an all-in-one platform for session replay, heatmaps, product and web analytics, feature flags, A/B testing, error tracking, and user surveys — everything you need to understand your users. This means it's not just an [alternative to Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar), but also tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/best-mixpanel-alternatives), [Sentry](/blog/best-sentry-alternatives), and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/best-launchdarkly-alternatives).

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of August 2025, PostHog is used on 4,882 (0.49%) of the top 1 million websites. Hotjar is used by [74,141 of the top 1 million websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Hotjar). Typical PostHog users are engineers and product managers at startups, scaleups, and mid-size companies, such as [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs), Raycast, and Airbus (a bit bigger than a mid-size company but 🤷‍♂️).

#### Key features

- 🎥 **Session replays:** Including event timelines, console logs, DOM explorer, network activity. Combine with error tracking to debug issues faster.
- 🔥 **Heatmaps:** Visualize user and rage clicks anywhere on your site, along with scroll depth and clickmaps.
- 📊 **Product analytics:** Analyze funnels, user paths, retention, and trends. Write your own custom queries with SQL.
- ⛳ **Feature flags & A/B testing:** Rollout features safely, run multivariate A/B tests.
- 📝 **Surveys:** Run custom, targeted, multi-step surveys or use our pre-built customer satisfaction, NPS, and PMF ones.

### How does PostHog compare to Hotjar?

Hotjar is great for web session replays and surveys, but users often rely on other tools for analytics and more. For example, according to BuiltWith, 27% of sites using Hotjar also use an analytics tool like Fullstory (21% of sites use Mixpanel). PostHog can replace them all and has a [generous free tier](/pricing) of 5,000 sessions and 1 million analytics events per month.

On top of this, PostHog provides session replays and surveys for iOS, Android (surveys soon), React Native, and Flutter for mobile apps, making it a great option if you need a [Hotjar-style tool for mobile apps](/blog/hotjar-for-mobile-ios-android-react-native-flutter).

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (session replay & surveys), [Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4), [GrowthBook](/blog/posthog-vs-growthbook) (feature flags and A/B testing), and more. This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get an additional $50k in credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, tracking errors, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
>
> PostHog is a broader, more powerful tool than Hotjar. This means more tools and mobile support, but this comes with some extra complexity. The payoff is all your user data in one place and tightly integrated with powerful analytical tools.
>
> It also has a [generous free tier](/pricing) for each of its products including 5,000 replays, 1 million events, and 250 surveys per month.

## 3. Sprig

- **Founded:** 2017
- **Most similar to:** Hotjar
- **Typical users:** Product teams and UX researchers
- **Typical customers:** Medium and large B2C and B2B products

![sprig](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/hotjar-alternatives/sprig.png)

### What is Sprig?

[Sprig](/blog/best-sprig-alternatives) is a user insights tool that combines surveys, session replays, and heatmaps with AI analysis. Sprig works slightly differently than other tools as it links surveys and session replays together in what it calls studies, normally triggered by specific user events. It doesn't do funnel analysis or other basic analytics, focusing solely on in-product user research.

According to [data from BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Sprig) (August 2025), Sprig is used on 538 of the top 1 million websites, though this figure likely doesn't include apps that aren't accessible via the open web. It's used by large, B2C companies such as PayPal, Coinbase, and Robinhood.

#### Key features

- 📝 **Surveys:** Run targeted surveys right in your product and capture real-time insights.
- 🎥 **Session replay:** Capture targeted user journey clips to see what's working.
- 🔥 **Heatmaps:** Get a visual representation of your users' in-product interactions.
- 🤖 **AI analysis:** Surface product issues and opportunities in real time.

### How does Sprig compare to Hotjar?

Sprig is a decent replacement for Hotjar, especially if you find Hotjar's survey tools lacking. Its support for mobile apps (minus Flutter) is a key differentiator.

Unfortunately, Sprig's pricing is opaque and it's unclear what's available for free or how much their paid tiers cost.

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Error tracking" description="Capture errors and exceptions, provide stack traces to debug issues" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Sprig?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/sprig/reviews), customers choose Sprig because:

1. **It gives them real-time feedback:** Sprig makes it easy for product teams to engage with users while they were actively using the product. This real-time feedback helps them make informed decisions, iterate features faster, and improve the overall user experience.

2. **It's easy to use:** Reviewers note how easy Sprig is to set up and use. This means they can go from idea to actionable learnings quickly.

3. **It has pre-built reports and templates:** Users like the comprehensive documentation and the fact there are numerous templates they can immediately apply and adapt to their needs.

> #### Bottom line
> 
> Sprig is a good option for product teams who want to run surveys and do in-depth analysis on user journeys within products, especially compared to other Hotjar alternatives like Mouseflow that are more focused on e-commerce and small business users.
>
> Their lack of pricing transparency is a negative though.

1. **Customer support and feedback:** Users value Pendo as a useful tool for customer support and feedback collection. They use Pendo's feedback features to gather qualitative data and feed that into Pendo's validation and roadmap features.

2. **Improving onboarding:** Combining Pendo's in-app guides and analytics features makes it easy for non-technical users to experiment with new onboarding flows and improve user adoption.

3. **Product planning:** Customers use Pendo's data tools, product validation, and roadmap features to align internal teams and stakeholders on product development.

> #### Bottom line
> [Pendo](/blog/best-pendo-alternatives) isn't a complete replacement for Hotjar due its lack of heatmaps, but the combination of analytics, session replay, and survey tools makes it useful for product managers, especially those who also need in-app product guides.
>
> Unfortunately, its lack of transparent pricing and no free replays are a negative.

### What is Microsoft Clarity?

[Microsoft Clarity](/blog/best-microsoft-clarity-alternatives) is a 100% free session replay tool that supports basic replay features and heatmaps. It also records rage clicks and dead clicks, and integrates with Google Analytics 4, so you can view your GA data in Clarity.

Unsurprisingly, given it's free, Clarity is very popular. [BuiltWith estimates](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Microsoft-Clarity) over 65,688 of the top 1 million websites use Clarity, making it one of the most popular alternatives, but still well below Hotjar's 74,141.

#### Key features

- 🎥 **Session replay:** Watch user sessions with built-in event timelines
- 🔥 **Heatmaps:** See where users click and how they navigate your website
- 📜 **Scrollmaps:** See how far users scroll and where they dwell
- 🤬 **Frustration signals:** Detect rage and dead clicks

### How does Clarity compare to Hotjar?

Clarity provides a great session replay and heatmap tool to the exclusion of all other features. Some Hotjar users might miss the surveys capabilities though.

It's also free, of course, though it only retains data for 30 days.

### Why do companies use Microsoft Clarity?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/microsoft-microsoft-clarity/reviews) and [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/236349/Microsoft-Clarity/), it's because:

1. **It's easy to set up and use:** Setting up Clarity doesn't require much technical knowledge and users mostly like the simple user interface.

2. **It helps uncover how users navigate:** Clarity users are mostly using it to understand how people navigate their websites and identify opportunities for improvement.

3. **It's free:** The short 30-day retention limit and lack of funnel analysis are easy to forgive when it's free.

> #### Bottom line
> Being free forever has made Clarity a very popular alternative to Hotjar. While it has some limitations, it covers most bases for small businesses provided you don't need surveys, feedback, or more advanced analytics features.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Hotjar replacement if:

- You'd like to replace multiple tools with just one.
- You want more powerful analytics than Hotjar can offer.
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing)).

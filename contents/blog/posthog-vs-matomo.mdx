PostHog and Matomo help you understand how your users are using your site and product, but they're very different tools below the surface:

[Matomo](/blog/best-matomo-alternatives) focuses on tracking sessions, making it ideal for running analytics on large content and e-commerce websites. It's designed to look and feel similar to Google Analytics 3, AKA Universal Analytics.

PostHog can also replace Google Analytics, but it offers a wider suite of tools for [product analytics](/product-analytics), [web analytics](/web-analytics), [session replays](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/experiments), [user surveys](/surveys), and much more.

## How is PostHog different from Matomo?

### 1. It's an all-in-one platform

Matomo charges extra for features like funnel analysis, cohorts, path analysis, A/B testing, and session recording. These are also considered add-ons and are not tightly integrated with the main analytics product. In PostHog, all of these tools work together and each comes with a generous free tier.

### 2. It's built for engineers

Rather than focusing on marketers like Matomo, PostHog focuses on the tools engineers need to build better products.

On top of product analytics, this includes A/B testing, feature flags, a complete API, direct SQL access, and more. PostHog also includes a data warehouse so you can import and query data from other sources as well as destinations to send your data to external warehouses or other tools.

### 3. Seamless integrations with the tools you already use

PostHog is built to work with the tools you already use.

That means you can import data and query from sources like Stripe, Hubspot, Zendesk, S3, and more. You can also export data in batches to your data warehouse like Snowflake or BigQuery as well as a range of real time destinations like Google Ads and Slack.

### Product analytics

Product analytics reveals the evolution of both tools. While PostHog has always focused on product analytics, Matomo has expanded its offering from a focus on web analytics.

        'product_analytics.features.custom_events',

### Integrations

A simple way to compare integrations:

-   PostHog has more integrations with dev tools.
-   Matomo has more integrations with e-commerce and CMS platforms.

But this doesn't mean either lacks those types of integrations.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'matomo']}
    rows={[
        'platform.integrations.csv_exports',
        {
            label: 'Warehouse exports',
            description: 'Export data to warehouses like S3 and BigQuery for storage and analysis',
            values: [true, 'BigQuery'],
        },
        'platform.integrations.warehouse_import',
        {
            label: 'Slack',
            description: 'Send events, reports, and anomalies to Slack',
            values: ['Events, reports', 'Reports, anomalies'],
        },
        'platform.integrations.email_reports',
        'platform.integrations.google_search_console',
        'platform.integrations.wordpress',
        'platform.integrations.stripe',
        'platform.integrations.hubspot',
        'platform.integrations.zendesk',
        'platform.integrations.zapier',
        'platform.integrations.sentry',
    ]}
/>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Although PostHog doesn't have dedicated integrations for CMS or ecommerce platforms, our script snippet makes it easy to use PostHog with basically any of these including [Shopify](/docs/libraries/shopify), [WordPress](/docs/libraries/wordpress), and [Webflow](/docs/libraries/webflow).

### Security and compliance

Matomo positions itself as a Google Analytics alternative that protects your data and customer privacy, but PostHog offers all of its privacy and compliance features (and more).

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'matomo']}
    rows={[
        'platform.deployment.self_host',
        'platform.security.bot_blocking',
        'platform.deployment.reverse_proxy',
        'platform.security.hipaa_ready',
        'platform.security.gdpr_ready',
        'platform.security.data_anonymization',
        'platform.security.soc2_certified',
        'platform.security.two_factor_auth',
        'platform.security.saml_sso',
        'platform.security.history_audit_logs',
    ]}
/>

> 💡 **Good to know:**
>
> -   Matomo's on-premise offering can be made HIPAA compliant, but not their cloud offering.
> -   PostHog is self-hostable under a MIT license [without guarantee](/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) or support.

PostHog and Matomo help you understand how your users are using your site and product, but they're very different tools below the surface:

[Matomo](/blog/best-matomo-alternatives) focuses on tracking sessions, making it ideal for running analytics on large content and e-commerce websites. It's designed to look and feel similar to Google Analytics 3, AKA Universal Analytics.

PostHog can also replace Google Analytics, but it offers a wider suite of tools for product analytics, web analytics, session replays, feature flags, A/B testing, user surveys, and much more.

## How is PostHog different from Matomo?

### 1. It's an all-in-one platform

Matomo charges extra for features like funnel analysis, cohorts, path analysis, A/B testing, and session recording. These are also considered add-ons and are not tightly integrated with the main analytics product. In PostHog, all of these tools work together and each comes with a generous free tier.

### 2. It's built for engineers

Rather than focusing on marketers like Matomo, PostHog focuses on the tools engineers need to build better products. 

On top of product analytics, this includes A/B testing, feature flags, a complete API, direct SQL access, and more. PostHog also includes a data warehouse so you can import and query data from other sources as well as destinations to send your data to external warehouses or other tools.

### 3. Seamless integrations with the tools you already use

PostHog is built to work with the tools you already use. 

That means you can import data and query from sources like Stripe, Hubspot, Zendesk, S3, and more. You can also export data in batches to your data warehouse like Snowflake or BigQuery as well as a range of real time destinations like Google Ads and Slack.

## Feature comparison

</ComparisonTable>

### Integrations

A simple way to compare integrations:

- PostHog has more integrations with data and product tools.
- Matomo has more integrations with ecommerce and CMS platforms.

But this doesn't mean either lacks those types of integrations.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Matomo">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="CSV exports" description="Export your data as a CSV" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="BigQuery" feature="Warehouse exports" description="Export data to warehouses like S3 and BigQuery for storage and analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Warehouse import" description="Import and query data from third-party sources like Postgres, S3, and GCS" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Events, reports" column2="Reports, anomalies" feature="Slack" description="Send events, reports, and anomalies to Slack" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Email" description="Send reports to email" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Google Search Console" description="See search queries that sent traffic to your site" />
	<ComparisonRow column1="Script" column2={true} feature="WordPress" description="Capture events from WordPress" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Stripe" description="Import and query charges, customers, invoices, subscriptions, and more" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Hubspot" description="Import and query contacts, companies, deals, and more" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false}feature="Sentry" description="Send and receive error data with Sentry" />
</ComparisonTable>

> ðŸ’¡ **Good to know:** Although PostHog doesn't have dedicated integrations for CMS or ecommerce platforms, our script snippet makes it easy to use PostHog with basically any of these including [Shopify](/docs/libraries/shopify), [WordPress](/docs/libraries/wordpress), and [Webflow](/docs/libraries/webflow).

Matomo positions itself as a Google Analytics alternative that protects your data and customer privacy, but PostHog offers all of its privacy and compliance features (and more).

Instead of a free trial, PostHog offers a free forever tier as long as you stay under the free limits. You don't even need a credit card, but adding one unlocks all the features (we have billing limits you can use too).

### Can PostHog also replace Google Analytics?

Yes. PostHog can replace Google Analytics for many use cases â€“ [our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing), for example. You can integrate PostHog into your website using Google Tag Manager. See our comparison of [PostHog and Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) and [An intro to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog) for more.

### Can I migrate from Matomo to PostHog?

Yes. See our [Matomo to PostHog migration guide](/docs/migrate/matomo) for more.

### Is PostHog hard to install and use?

Although PostHog has many features, it isn't necessarily complicated. Our [web analytics](/web-analytics) dashboard is similar to Matomo's:

<ProductScreenshot
    imageLight = "https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Clean_Shot_2024_10_01_at_11_39_58_2x_5dff6baf53.png"

    classes="rounded"
    alt="PostHog web analytics dashboard"
/>

Our [install snippet](/docs/getting-started/install?tab=snippet) is also only a couple of lines:

```html
<script>
    !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.crossOrigin="anonymous",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="capture identify alias people.set people.set_once set_config register register_once unregister opt_out_capturing has_opted_out_capturing opt_in_capturing reset isFeatureEnabled onFeatureFlags getFeatureFlag getFeatureFlagPayload reloadFeatureFlags group updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment getEarlyAccessFeatures getActiveMatchingSurveys getSurveys getNextSurveyStep onSessionId".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);

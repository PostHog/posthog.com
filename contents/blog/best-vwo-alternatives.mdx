## 5. Heap

- **Founded:** 2013
- **Similar to:** PostHog, FullStory
- **Typical users:** Product and marketing teams
- **Typical customers:** B2C SaaS and ecommerce companies with a user experience focus.

### What is Heap?

[Heap](/blog/posthog-vs-heap) describes itself as a digital insights platform. This means it offers both product analytics and session replay and supports marketing use cases with multi-touch attribution. 

Contentsquare, a marketing and ecommerce analytics firm, acquired Heap in September 2023 and announced plans to integrate the two products. Contentsquare also owns [Hotjar](/blog/best-hotjar-alternatives), another alternative on this list.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Heap), as of April 2024, 4,062 of the top one million websites deploy Heap. This is just under half of VWO's 9,183.

### Key features

- ✅ **Event autocapture:** Product teams don't need to rely on engineers to instrument all events. Heap has a visual editor for teams to tag events directly on-page for analysis.

- 📺 **Session replay:** Get qualitative insights about user behavior by replaying their session – although this lacks the debugging tools typical of most replay tools.

- 🔥 **Heatmaps:** See where people click, what point they scroll to, and the areas that get the most attention.

- 🤖 **Analysis suggestions**: Advanced data science capabilities discover hidden interactions, friction points, and knowledge about key paths.

- 🔁 **Managed ETL:** Connect to data warehouses, so you can combine your analytics with other sources and get a fuller picture of the entire user journey.

### How does Heap compare to VWO?

Similar to Amplitude, Heap focuses on analytics and session replay for product teams. This means it misses out on the experimentation features of VWO.

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Heap?

According to G2 reviews, people enjoy these three areas of Heap:

1. **Autocapture:** Non-technical users love how easy autocapture makes tracking on their site. Along with the element data included, this provides a huge amount of useful analytics data with little setup.

2. **Simple setup:** People find Heap easy to set up. Add a single script to your site and data starts being captured. Heap then makes it easy to visualize that data through user paths, funnels, and session replays.

3. **Streamlining analysis:** By having analytics and session replay data in one place, Heap makes it easy to understand the usage of their app or site. This replaces interviews or user testing and makes the development cycle faster.

> #### Bottom line
> For product teams looking for analytics and session replay, [Heap](/blog/best-heap-alternatives) is a good alternative (it's self-serve). If you are looking to match the experimentation functionality of VWO, you should look elsewhere.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes the necessary tools to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B/n tests, and [gathering feedback](/templates/in-app-feedback-survey) with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> Having all the features of Amplitude (and more) while being free, self-serve, and open source makes PostHog a great alternative. This is especially true for engineering-focused startups and scale-ups as it provides the tools to build a great product.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Amplitude replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want tools to help you understand users in more depth (we added session replay, surveys, and more on top of Amplitude's feature set)
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

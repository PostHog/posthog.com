## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Amplitude replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want tools to help you understand users in more depth (we added session replay, surveys, and more on top of Amplitude's feature set)
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

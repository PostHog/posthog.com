[Amplitude](/posthog-vs-amplitude) is a solid product analytics platform – it's powerful, mature, and trusted by thousands of companies – but it's not the right fit for every team.

Maybe you need [error tracking](/error-tracking) or [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics) that Amplitude doesn't offer. Maybe you're looking for a more developer-friendly platform. Maybe you just want to see what's out there; whatever the case, there are alternatives worth considering.

In this guide, we compare the best Amplitude alternatives across analytics, session replay, experimentation, and more so you can find the right fit for your team and use case.

This means creating funnels to track [conversion](/docs/web-analytics/conversion-goals), watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B/n tests, and [gathering feedback](/templates/in-app-feedback-survey) with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
>
> Having all the features of Amplitude (and more) while being free, self-serve, and open source makes PostHog a great alternative. This is especially true for engineering-focused startups and scale-ups as it provides the tools to build a great product.

- **Metric trees:** Map how specific engagement metrics connect to business outcomes and track impact across your product.

- **Warehouse connectors:** Sync data bidirectionally with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Redshift.

### How does Mixpanel compare to Amplitude?

Mixpanel and Amplitude are the original product analytics platforms and have battled for many years. Both have expanded well beyond core analytics – Mixpanel relaunched experimentation and added feature flags in late 2025, while Amplitude has built out session replay and heatmaps. The two platforms are now more similar than ever.

### What is Statsig?

[Statsig](/blog/best-statsig-alternatives) provides tools like experimentation, feature flags, and analytics to help companies build better products. Teams use it to take the risk out of releases, experiment with new features, and monitor changes.

It also includes a warehouse-native mode to connect directly and utilize your current data warehouse such as Snowflake or BigQuery.

### Key features

- **Experimentation:** Measure the impact of new changes with frequentist and Bayesian analysis engines.
- **Feature flags:** Take the risk out of releases with targeted feature flag rollouts.
- **Analytics:** Provides a single location for your metrics. Enables users to dive deeper into them with trends, bar charts, and retention analysis.
- **Data warehouse:** Use Statsig with your existing data in your own warehouse. Generate insights and calculate impact using existing data.

### How does Statsig compare to Amplitude?

Opposite to many of the alternatives on this list, Statsig focuses on A/B testing and feature flags. It does include basic analytics, but not nearly at the same level as Amplitude.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary>What is Amplitude used for?</summary>

**Amplitude** is a product analytics platform used to track user behavior, analyze conversion funnels, measure retention, and run A/B tests. Product, growth, and marketing teams use it to understand how users interact with their products and make data-driven decisions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why look for an Amplitude alternative?</summary>

Common reasons include: needing features Amplitude doesn't offer (like error tracking or LLM analytics), wanting more transparent usage-based pricing instead of MTU-based contracts, preferring a more developer-friendly or open-source platform, or simply wanting more features in one tool.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the best Amplitude alternative overall?</summary>

For most teams, **PostHog** is the best alternative. It includes everything Amplitude offers (product analytics, session replay, A/B testing, surveys) plus error tracking, LLM analytics, and feature flags – all with transparent pricing and a generous free tier.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Amplitude alternatives are open source?</summary>

**PostHog** is the only major open-source alternative on this list. Visit [this guide](/blog/best-open-source-product-analytics-tools) for additional open source product analytics options.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which alternative has the best free tier?</summary>

**PostHog** offers the most generous free tier: 1 million events, 5,000 session replays, and 1 million feature flag requests per month. Amplitude's free tier includes 10K MTUs and 1,000 session replays. Mixpanel offers 1 million events free but lacks session replay on free plans.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which alternative is best for startups?</summary>

**PostHog** stands out for early-stage companies. Beyond the generous free tier, startups can apply for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) to get $50,000 in additional credits. The usage-based pricing also means you only pay for what you use as you scale, rather than committing to seat-based or MTU contracts upfront.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which alternative is best for engineering teams?</summary>

**PostHog** and **Statsig** are both built with engineers in mind. PostHog offers SQL access for custom queries, a fully documented API, and SDKs for every major platform. Statsig excels at experimentation workflows that integrate into CI/CD pipelines. If your team values being able to dig into the code or wants direct access to the people building the product, PostHog's open-source nature and engineer-focused support model fit well.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which alternative is best for A/B testing and experimentation?</summary>

**Statsig** is the best choice if experimentation is your primary focus – it offers advanced statistical methods like CUPED, sequential testing, and warehouse-native experiment analysis. **PostHog** is ideal if you want experimentation tightly integrated with the rest of your product stack, so you can instantly see how experiments impact funnels, replays, and error rates.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which alternative is best for session replay?</summary>

**PostHog** and **LogRocket** both excel at session replay. PostHog's strength is connecting replays to the broader product context – you can jump from a funnel drop-off directly into a relevant replay, or see which feature flag variant a user was on. LogRocket adds performance monitoring and is particularly strong for debugging frontend issues with detailed network and console data.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Amplitude have error tracking?</summary>

No. Amplitude does not offer error tracking or crash reporting. If you need to monitor exceptions and stack traces alongside your analytics, consider **PostHog** (which ties errors to user sessions and feature flags), **LogRocket** (which connects errors to performance data), or **Smartlook** (which links crash reports to mobile session replays).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Amplitude have LLM analytics?</summary>

No. Amplitude does not offer LLM observability or AI analytics features. **PostHog** is currently the only analytics platform on this list that includes [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics) for tracking AI product usage, monitoring model performance, analyzing token costs, and debugging LLM interactions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use Amplitude with my data warehouse?</summary>

Yes. Amplitude offers warehouse-native analytics that can query data directly from Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks. **Statsig** and **Mixpanel** also offer strong data warehouse integrations. **PostHog** takes [a different approach](/warehouse-native) where we offer an integrated data warehouse and options to ingest data from external sources so that queries run on our compute. This approach is better if you want a single platform for analyzing data and using other features, such as surveys, as you don't need to maintain an external warehouse in addition to other tools. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>What other analytics tools are available?</summary>

We've written comparison guides for many analytics categories. See our takes on the best [Mixpanel alternatives](/blog/best-mixpanel-alternatives), [Heap alternatives](/blog/best-heap-alternatives), [Google Analytics alternatives](/blog/ga4-alternatives), and [open source analytics tools](/blog/best-open-source-product-analytics-tools).

One of the most unexpectedly valuable skills as a founder that I've had is hitting the front page of [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com).

Out of five posts that I hoped would get there, four did. Look mom, lots of traffic:

I don't proclaim to be a well establish writer. Amongst many, many other things, I'm inconsistent with publishing and being British means I wrestle with writing in US English. One thing I do have going for me is that I've spent an embarassingly-large amount of time reading content that engineers find engaging.

This is what I have learned thus far. I've created a framework for those also working at developer-focussed companies, writing for the same audience as me.

Disclaimer: my company doesn't care about appealing (directly) to CTOs. If you work at Top Down Enterprise Technology Corp, just do the opposite of what I say.

## Be human

Personal theory: humans are evolved to care about other humans - it's how we survived as a race through prehistoric times. Companies are just a bunch (mostly) of humans, so if you get that across then people will want to read your writing.

Do:

* Give character to the _humans_ involved in what you write about. Go into unexpected detail. Tell [stories](https://hbr.org/2014/07/how-to-tell-a-great-story). They don't need to be impressive - the goal is to make things real.
* Make it real - real life photos, chat logs, social media posts, social media profiles (well, sort of real). 
* Add humor - be self deprecating. Noone is some perfect corporate being. We make mistakes, and being willing to open up builds trust. 

Do not:

* It's easy to fall into the trap of giving clichéd startup advice. If what you're writing is generic advice that 90% of people are likely to know, and is something that PostHog just followed, then assume this will already be known by the audience. 

## Use as few words as possible

Think about your audience here folks.

The life of a developer involves rapidly finding answers to sometimes-what-feels-like-endless problems. Whilst not universal, my grand theory here is that many have an impatient reading style developed by scanning for relevant information all day... Probably something to do with Googling Stack Overflow a lot.

"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time." - [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal)

Most of your time should be *re*writing.

Do:

* Get to the point in as few words as possible. 
* Keep sentences short, with a little variation every now and again.

Do not:

* "Here are five elements that..."
* "This has brought us many benefits"
* Use longer words than necessary ie "disruption"
* Do not repeat yourself
* Do not tell people what they are about to read or what they just read

## Pick a side

The world is full of information - if you can get them right, it's more valuable to give recommendations distilled from the information available.

It's especially interesting to read well-reasoned contrarian points of view. For example, at PostHog we focussed on engineering instead of sales from very early on - it's therefore interesting to learn why we did this and the impact it had.

Do:

* Be opinionated.
* Provide contrary points of view, if you believe in them.
* Experience even on a small scale matters - give anecdotes.

Do not:

* "Ultimately, it's up to you"
* "This article will help you decide"

## Be engaging

There are 1.8 *billion* websites on the internet, [apparently](https://www.internetlivestats.com/watch/websites/).

[Alex Ohanian](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian) does the best job of summing up what this means for your readers - "they're only a click away from a picture of a funny cat".

Do:

* Get the title right, first. It sets direction. Do not create a title after the piece - if you can't get it right up front, you haven't got a clear enough idea of what you want to write. The end result will be a vague, unopinionated and dull piece of writing. You may need to start writing the piece to get a sense of what the article _should_ be (see ideas on [creative faucets](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1327765347936522240)). If this happens you should smile, throw away most of your previous work and get writing!
* Frequently link to the places that you reference - Wikipedia, Twitter accounts or threads, GitHub issues. This means you can encourage people to explore for themselves... which is fun due to evolutionary reasons, I suspect.

Do *not*:

* Use clickbaity titles. Developers are power internet users and will see through them. "How to make X not suck", "Top 10 ways to X". They _should_ be interesting and engaging but not a cliché.
* Be very careful if you are being dismissive about others. You should _never_ alienate your own audience. Be kind.

## Be precise

Being concise means giving a lot of information clearly and in a few words. It doesn't mean skipping details.

Do:

* If technology is relevant to the point you're making, be specific. Developers are interested in this stuff. Name the database we use for scalability, drop a link to it.
* Add quantities where you can. "We grew a lot because of X" -> "We had our first 100 users from Y"
* Say what things do, use diagrams to explain stuff. Don't use high level language.

Do not:

* "A lot"
* "Soon"
* "Quickly"
* "Better"

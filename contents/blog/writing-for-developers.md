Despite only writing a handful, our blog posts have made the [Hacker News front page](https://news.ycombinator.com) 4 times. See the resulting blog traffic:

We're new at writing, but we've spent an embarassingly-large amount of time reading content that engineers find engaging. We've created a framework for those working at developer-focussed companies, writing for the same audience.

Disclaimer: we don't care about appealing (directly) to CTOs. If you work at Top Down Enterprise Technology Corp, just do the opposite of what we say.

## Be human

Companies are just a bunch of people. Make that clear in your writing.

* Give more character to the _people_ involved in what you write about. Give details that you'd not expect. Tell stories about them - there should be several characters, details on the location, a situation, friction and resolution.
* Add images - real life photos, chat logs, social media posts.
* Add humor - be self deprecating. We're not some perfect corporate being. We make mistakes, and being willing to open up builds trust.

Do *not*

* It's easy to fall into the trap of giving clichÃ©d startup advice. If what you're writing is generic advice that 90% of people are likely to know, and is something that PostHog just followed, then assume this will already be known by the audience. 

## Use as few words as possible

Developers spend a lot of time scanning for answers to questions they have. Whilst not universal, many have an impatient reading style. You should expect to revise your writing multiple times, else you're not trying hard enough. In the words of [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time."

Do:

* Get to the point - a learning, an anecodate - in as few words as possible. 
* Keep sentencies short, with a little variation every now and again.

Do *not*:

* "Here are five elements that..."
* "This has brought us many benefits"
* Use longer words than necessary ie "disruption"
* Do not repeat yourself
* Do not tell people what they are about to read or what they just read

## Pick a side

Where possible, pick a side. Never give neutral advice when you believe there is an argument for one approach over the other.

* Be opinionated.
* Provide contrary points of view, if you believe in them.
 
## Be engaging

Do:

* Get the title right, first. It sets direction. Do not create a title after the piece - if you can't get it right up front, you haven't got a clear enough idea of what you want to write. The end result will be a vague, unopinionated and dull piece of writing.  Bonus point - it's a _lot_ quicker to iterate a title than to iterate a 1,000 word article!
* Link heavily to internal or external places that you reference. Wikipedia, people's Twitter accounts or threads, GitHub issues. This means people will organically spend time playing around in PostHog's world.

Do *not*:

* Use generic clickbaity titles. "How to make X not suck", "Top 10 ways to X".
* Be very careful if you are being dismissive about others. You should _never_ alienate your own audience.

## Be precise

* If technology is relevant to the point you're making, be specific. Developers are interested in this stuff. Name the database we use for scalability, drop a link to it.
* Add quantities where you can. "We grew a lot because of X" -> "We had our first 100 users from Y"
* Say what things do, use diagrams to explain stuff. Don't use high level language.

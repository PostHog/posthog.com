It’s been hard to talk about MCP – [model context protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

It’s just so abstract. Why would you want this? What does it do?

So let’s break it down into actionable terms.

MCP exists because our meat is slow, and machines are fast.

## Are you down with MCP?

In the bad old days of two years ago, using the latest models for writing code meant manually ferrying text between your editor and a browser tab.

It was tedious, sure, but even worse: it was error-prone. The manual interventions were driven by our imprecise brains and fingers, and it was easy to mis-select the text you were trying to move around.

Today, we have apps like Cursor. Instead of a human manually moving code, a tool reads code into the LLM’s context, plans interventions, and executes edits for you. It does this in a tight loop, even detecting and correcting errors as they’re written.

What used to take minutes can happen in seconds. Automation at its finest.

So: copy-paste is the enemy of a good LLM developer experience. The job for developer tools is to make it unnecessary, and MCP exists to support this goal. Get exactly the right data in and out of an agent session, do it fast, don’t make the developer work.

## Saving labor with MCP

First, make it easy to install an MCP server. You can use an [automated tool](/blog/envoy-wizard-llm-agent) to inject the configuration on the developer’s behalf. Check out [this pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/wizard/pull/48) from our wizard for a look at how that works.

Next, let’s understand the protocol’s features.

### Resources

**What they do**: resources dump information into the context. This could be an API key, a JSON body to help write parsing logic, or a list of established values that code must incorporate.

**How they save labor**: imagine implementing [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags/adding-feature-flag-code) in some new code. We *really* don’t want the model to invent new names for this stuff. But we also don’t want the developer to log into their account and start copying and pasting flag names. So instead, we pipe a list directly into the agent session.

### Tools

**What they do**: tools trigger actions on behalf of the user, based on the goals and information already in the context. This means you can automate complex workflows to make sure no steps are skipped, and no transcription errors happen.

**How they save labor**: back to the feature flags example. If you’re in a *brand new app* and there are no feature flag names already established, a tool could save the user lots of clicking and typing. Within seconds, the new configuration can be written to a project, creating, naming and describing all the new flags.

### Prompts

**What they do**: exactly what you expect. They prompt the model. The spookiest thing for me – still! – is that instead of “programming” LLMs, you just kinda tell them what to do. Some instructions produce better results than others, and so consistently using a tested prompt can improve every developer’s session.

**How they save labor**: you can use both the agent session *and* conventional programming to decide *which* prompt to apply. Maybe Next.js 14 wants one prompt, while 15 wants another. Instead of a developer having to figure out the right phrasing, or read documentation to help structure a prompt, your MCP server can pick up the load. Prompts can also work in tandem with tools and resources, guiding the agent session in how to accomplish work.

## The power is yours

That’s the intro to model context prototol I wish we’d all had. It’s a straightforward contract for saving labor, eliminating tedium, and tightly integrating existing products with the emerging universe of LLM agent tools.

We’re [working on one](https://github.com/posthog/mcp), and it runs on Cloudflare, so if you wanted to steal it to get started on your own MCP project, you could!

There’s still plenty to figure out in this domain. You probably don’t want to give an MCP server unfettered access to every API route in your product, for example. You could. But [you should stop to think if you *should*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3j9muCo4o0).

## Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/configuring-posthog/upgrading-posthog).

### [Bar Charts by Graph Series/Value](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3457)

![Bar chart by values](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/bar-value.png)

Before this change, our bar charts would always be time-based, meaning that if you had multiple graph series (values), these would just all be stacked into one bar for each time period.

However, we now support two different types of bar charts! When selecting a chart type, you will see the options 'Time' and 'Value' under 'Bar Chart'. Selecting 'Value' will give you the view from the image above, where each graph series is represented in a separate bar, with the value consisting of the aggregate value for the time period specified.

### [UTM Tags Automatically Set as User Properties](https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/214)

If you use UTM tags to track your marketing campaigns, for example, these will now be automatically set as user properties, so you can filter and create cohorts of users much more easily based on what campaign, source, or medium brought them to your product or landing page.

### [Multiple Value Selector for Equality Filters](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3422)

![Multiple equality selector](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/multiple-selector.png)

When setting equality filters (`equals`, `doesn't equal`), you can now select multiple values instead of just one.

### [Refreshing Dashboards and Updating Time Range for All Panels](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3363)

![Dashboards New UX](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/dashboards-ux.png)

Dashboards just got a set of significant improvements to make your job easier when looking through your key metrics:

- You can now refresh all dashboard panels at once to ensure you're not seeing cached results
- You can change the time range of all dashboard panels to the same range at once
- You are able to see who created a dashboard and when

### [Exposing $set and $set_once on all events](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3363)

![Set properties on any event](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/%24set.png)

The event properties `$set` and `$set_once` can now be used on any event to set properties directly to the user associated with that event.

Previously, this would only work on `$identify` events, making it so that you needed to call multiple methods in order to send an event and set user properties based on the same data. But now, you can do it all in one, as shown in the image above.

### [Event Sequence Timer Plugin](https://posthog.com/plugins/event-sequence-timer-plugin)

![Event Sequence Timer Plugin](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/time-events.png)

Our users requested a way to measure the time passed between certain events, and this is it!

By installing the Event Sequence Timer Plugin, you can specify as many sets of events as you want and the plugin will track the time between them, either using a first touch or last touch mechanism.

It will then add a property to your events that allows you to easily build visualizations in PostHog of the average, minimum, and maximum time between events, as well as all the other mathematical operations we support.

### [Property Flattener Plugin](https://posthog.com/plugins/property-flattener)

![Property Flattener Plugin](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/flattener.png)

The new Property Flattener Plugin allows you to convert event properties contained in a nested structure into a flat structure, allowing you to set filters based on the nested properties.


### [Project API Key Autofill in Docs for Cloud Users](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/998)

![Docs Token Autofill](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/token-autofill.png)

If you're a user of PostHog Cloud, we now autofill your Project API Key and API Host automatically in the Docs for you, meaning you can copy-paste snippets and use them directly with no manual changes!

This key will be based on the last project you used in PostHog, and you can check what project that is by simply hovering your cursor over the highlighted key.

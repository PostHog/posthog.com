PostHog 1.22 is out with awesome new features, usability and performance improvements, and the usual bug squashing.

### Community MVP

The community MVP for PostHog 1.22.0 is [oshura3](https://github.com/oshura3), who did a [thorough review and edit of our website content](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1045) and continues to be active in design and marketing discussions.

Anyone can contribute to PostHog and open source, whether it's code, copy, design or discussion. We're delighted that our community are so passionate that they even [share PostHog with their family](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/1036#issuecomment-788732593) ;)

## Important Announcement for Self-Hosted Users

If you're self hosting PostHog, make sure you have your app server up and running by looking at the color of the middle circle on the top left of the PostHog UI.

If it is running, you'll see a green checkmark, and hovering over it will give the message "All systems operational", like so:

![Plugin server](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/plugin-server.png)

From this release (1.22.0) onwards, if your app server is not running, this circle will turn amber. You can click on the server to verify if your app server is indeed the problem.

**Important:** next release we will move all our event ingestion to the app server, meaning that you **will not be able to ingest events** if your app server isn't running.

## PostHog 1.22.0 Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

### [Bar Charts by Graph Series/Value](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3457)

![Bar chart by values](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/bar-value.png)

Before this release bar charts were time-based, which meant that if you had multiple graph series (values), they would all be stacked into one bar for each time period.

We now support two different types of bar charts! When selecting a chart type, you will see the options 'Time' and 'Value' under 'Bar Chart'. Selecting 'Value' will give you the view from the image above, where each graph series is represented in a separate bar, with the value consisting of the aggregate value for the time period specified.

### [UTM Tags Automatically Set as User Properties](https://github.com/PostHog/plugin-server/pull/214)

![UTM Tags](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/utm-tags.png)

PostHog now automatically sets user properties from [UTM tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters). You can now filter and create cohorts of users much more easily based on what campaign, source, or medium brought them to your product or landing page. This is a big feature for us as it gives our users an automatic way of connecting marketing and product to have a more complete view of your business. We're very excited for our community to start using this feature and extending it through [apps](https://posthog.com/docs/plugins/overview).

### [Multiple Value Selector for Equality Filters](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3422)

![Multiple equality selector](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/multiple-selector.png)

Writing complex filters is now easier than ever before. You can now select multiple values for Equality Filters instead of just one - this will simplify filter creation and debugging and just save people a lot of time!

### [Refreshing Dashboards and Updating Time Range for All Panels](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3363)

![Dashboards New UX](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/dashboards-ux.png)

It's now easier to work through your key metrics in Dashboards:

-   All dashboard panels can be refreshed at the same time to ensure you're not seeing cached results
-   Time ranges for all dashboard panels can be changed at the same time
-   The dashboard author and creation time are displayed below the title

### [A Much Better UI for Person Pages](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3461)

![Persons New UX](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/persons-v2.png)

The UI of our person pages just got a whole lot better! As is often the case with our larger features, this isn't news to all of you. We had this behind a feature flag and have now decided to roll it out for everyone.

Now you can visualize user properties alongside a user's events, and most of the context you need on a person is available to you in a sleek UI without you needing to scroll.

Oh, and the code got much better as a result too...

### [Exposing $set and $set_once on all events](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3363)

![Set properties on any event](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/%24set.png)

The event properties `$set` and `$set_once` can now be used on any event to set properties directly to the user associated with that event.

Previously, this would only work on `$identify` events, making it so that you needed to call multiple methods in order to send an event and set user properties based on the same data. But now, you can do it all in one, as shown in the image above.

### [Event Sequence Timer](https://posthog.com/plugins/event-sequence-timer-plugin)

![Event Sequence Timer](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/time-events.png)

Our users requested a way to measure the time passed between certain events, and this is it!

By installing the Event Sequence Timer, you can specify as many sets of events as you want and the app will track the time between them, either using a first touch or last touch mechanism.

It will then add a property to your events that allows you to easily build visualizations in PostHog of the average, minimum, and maximum time between events, as well as all the other mathematical operations we support.

### [Property Flattener](https://posthog.com/plugins/property-flattener)

![Property Flattener](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/flattener.png)

The new Property Flattener allows you to convert event properties contained in a nested structure into a flat structure, allowing you to set filters based on the nested properties.

### [Project API Key Autofill in Docs for Cloud Users](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/998)

![Docs Token Autofill](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/token-autofill.png)

If you're a user of PostHog Cloud, we now autofill your Project API Key and API Host automatically in the Docs for you, meaning you can copy-paste snippets and use them directly with no manual changes!

This key will be based on the last project you used in PostHog, and you can check what project that is by simply hovering your cursor over the highlighted key.

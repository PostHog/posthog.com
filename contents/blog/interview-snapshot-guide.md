Regularly talking to users is an important habit for any team, but you also need an efficient way to share what you learn. Traditional scientific methods areeffective but too time consuming, especially for a fast-moving startup. This is why, at PostHog, we use interview snapshots to share insights from interviews with the team. 

Championed by Teresa Torres in the book [Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309), interview snapshots are great conversation starters you can create with minimal effort – an 80/20 method that allows us to gather feedback, generate quick insights, build MVPs, measure their success and iterate. 

In this guide, I'll share how we create user interview snapshots at PostHog – including the following template that you can download and fill out, or recreate in Google Docs, Figma or any other tool of your choice.

## Interview snapshots explained

// Annika to create this

### 1. Note high-level information of your user**

To set the scene, add the user’s name at the top of the interview snapshot. For B2B companies, we also recommend adding the job role and company name. It’s also handy to add the date of the interview and a high-level summary what the interview was about. If available, add a picture of the user and the company logo, if the context is B2B. Believe us, this will spur your memory if you revisit the interview in a couple weeks’ time.

### 2. Add any relevant background information**

What information about your user is relevant to your company and product? Their age? Their responsibilities in their job role? How their morning routine looks like? Write this information down in the “quick facts” column. We also recommend writing down any previous experience the user has with your product.

### 3. List the opportunities you’ve identified**

Did the user express any pain points or desires in relation to your product or problem area? Write these down in the “Opportunities” column. During the interview, make sure you really get to the bottom of the user’s needs, and avoid the [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/). Make sure to list problems here, and not feature ideas. 

### 4. Note any other interesting insights**

If the user mentioned anything interesting that doesn’t fit in the “Opportunities” column, you can add it to “Insights”. This can include anything that isn’t a pain point, a need or a desire. Did the user show any uncommon behaviour? Did they share anything about why they chose your product (or not)? If there is anything you want your colleagues to know about without reading the whole interview transcript, this is the place to put it.

### 5. Add 1-2 memorable quotes**

At the top of the template, there is space to add 1-2 memorable quotes from the interview. This is useful for example if the user shared a particular emotion in the interview you want to relay word by word, and you want to create empathy in your team for this particular issue.

### 6. Share the interview snapshot with your team**

Take a screenshot of your completed interview snapshot and share it on Slack (or any other messenger platform you use)! At PostHog, we have a #posthog-feedback channel everyone in the company has access to. Sharing the snapshot in such a way is bound to create a conversation, follow up questions or ideas. This is exactly what you want.

## More tips for successful interviews

- Invite your team members to join for the interview and have a quick debrief after. You will be surprised how the same user feedback is perceived differently by different people.

- Make your full interview notes accessible to everyone in the team. This allows people to get context around the snippets you have added to your interview snapshot.

- If you’ve done a round of interviews around a certain topic, aside from user snapshots, summarise what you’ve learned. This allows you to highlight opportunity areas that have been mentioned several times or are a bigger problem then others, thus guiding your prioritisation.

In short, creating user interview snapshots is a great way of capturing the gist of a user interview and sharing insights in an accessible way. While they won’t replace more scientific qualitative analysis methods, in many cases they are enough to hit the ground running.

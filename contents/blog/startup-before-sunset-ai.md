> Each month, we speak to a team enrolled in [PostHog for Startups](/startups) about the way they work and the challenges they face. This month we spoke to BeforeSunset AI about their approach to launching new products!

[BeforeSunset AI](https://www.beforesunset.ai/) is an AI-powered daily planner that takes care of your schedule and helps ward off the stress of missed deadlines and forgotten tasks. Founded in November 2022 by entrepreneur and software engineer Elif Duran, BeforeSunset has since grown to a team of 15 and is used by hundreds of teams. 

“The first version of BeforeSunset was just an internal time tracking tool I’d built,” explains Elif. “But when we launched as a separate venture we saw that no other productivity tool asks you the questions needed to plan a day properly. We realized that AI could help if it knew what you were doing, how long it would take, and how long you have available.”

After rebuilding the product around this AI-powered vision, the team wanted to relaunch in earnest — and in June 2023 debuted on Product Hunt, going on to win [Product of the Day, Week, and Month](https://www.producthunt.com/products/beforesunset). Here’s how:

### 1. Create a product launch plan in advance

Unsurprisingly for a productivity startup, it all began with a plan.

“We had a clear plan in our minds for the product,” says Elif. “We wanted to complete the core features, such as to-do listing and time blocking, and we also wanted to build in AI features. In total it took about three months before we were ready to launch to users.”

This development time afforded the growth team time to plan, while also giving them the benefit of knowing how the product would come together. Work was hard — to the point that Elif worked several 40-hour days — but came together smoothly. 

“On the marketing side our efforts started six months before the launch,” says Growth Lead Zekiye Nur Kesici. “In addition to on-going activities we began a waitlist for the new version and began growing it. We tried many different channels, including Reddit, Indie Hackers, Hacker News — and we spent a month on competitor analysis to find new channels too.”

### 2. Prioritize community and creativity

Focusing on community engagement is an important part of any launch plan, according to Zekiye — and the earlier you start, the more successful you’ll be. 

“We chose to focus on the Product Hunt community and we knew that would require us to be active on the platform,” she explains. “That means finding ways to add value; ways you can support them whenever you’re in touch so that, in turn, you can benefit from the community.”

Creative assets were also a major focus for BeforeSunset AI. The team created new product screenshots and videos ahead of the launch, and carefully considered how to make the launch page look as on-brand as possible even as the product continued to change and improve internally.

> ### How to find the right community
> Finding the right community or launch channel can be a significant challenge all by itself. BeforeSunset AI uses PostHog to track users and understand their behavior, but also runs regular customer interviews. Understanding who users are, what their pain points are, and where they look for solutions is just as important to selecting a launch channel as experimentation.

### 3. Create an outreach strategy

With Product Hunt, you only have a short amount of time in order to get traction and galvanize the community. Take too long and you’ll fall off the daily page, and into the archives. So, you need a strategy to continue currying favor and votes throughout the day.

“We created a spreadsheet of our users and ran some one-on-one outreach to them,” says Zekiye Nur Kesici. “We even had a competition in the marketing team, offering a prize to whoever could reach out to the most people via LinkedIn. We also ran a webinar, published a blog post, used social media, and leveraged our waitlist to collect votes.”

### 4. If at first you don’t succeed, try again

However, even if you have a solid launch plan things can still go awry. [PostHog’s own Product Hunt launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/posthog), for example, saw us pipped to the top spot by a popular crypto project on the same day. BeforeSunset too had run [a previous Product Hunt launch](https://www.producthunt.com/products/beforesunset#beforesunset) which failed to reach the level of success as more recent launches. 

“It’s always important to bear in mind that success is rarely straightforward and that setbacks are a normal part of being an entrepreneur,” advises Elif. “You must be patient and persistent; have faith in your ability to find answers or make a new path. You have to be strong all the time, and know you are not alone.

“I’m lucky in that I have the most incredible team, and a good team makes everything easier, greater. Product is important, but humans are everything.”

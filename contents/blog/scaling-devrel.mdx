Developer Relations comes in many shapes and sizes. It exists and is executed in different ways at almost every company. We've just begun our [developer relations journey at PostHog](/handbook/growth/developer-relations) and we still don't know exactly what it will look like in the medium term. But we can still assess what our needs are going to look like and formulate a plan for growing a scaling developer relations. This, at the very least, provides a level of clarity that enables us to move forwards as we iterate, learn, and continuously improve.

In this post, I'll share the questions I've posed myself and the answers I've come to when thinking about growing and scaling developer relations at PostHog. I hope others will find the sharing of these questions, how we intend to answer them, and the process we've gone through valuable when planning the growth of their DevRel team.

## Does the company need DevRel?

This one is simple. If a company has one or more products that are used by developers then the answer is "yes" because developer relations exists to serve customers who are developers.

This doesn't instantly mean you need to hire a team, or even have a person in a fulltime DevRel role, but it does mean you at least need somebody to wear a DevRel hat from time-to-time.

### At PostHog...

PostHog is an open-source product analytics platform. We do have end-users of PostHog that aren't developers. But there are plenty of interactions with PostHog from developers. It is [installed](/docs/self-host), maintained, [integrated](/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog), and also [used](/docs/user-guides) by software developers with a product mindset. My current thinking is that a key persona for DevRel at PostHog is someone who would identify themselves as a "Product Engineer".

## What will DevRel do?

Responsibilities that could fall to dedidcated DevRel roles will likely fall to other team members at early stage developer-focused startups. But, as a company grows, there will be a need to have people taking on DevRel in a fulltime capacity.

Devrel is a multi-functional profession:

- **Product vision and definition**: some developer relations teams wholly own parts of the product but this will almost always come hand-in-hand with also being responsible for engineering execution too (see next bullet point). This will include market research, vision setting, and customer interviews to validate ideas or get product feedback. For example, at Nexmo/Vonage DevRel the team was responsible for the API standards and the full life-cycle of the documentation and server SDKS.
- **Engineering execution**: within DevRel this will likely be referred to as "Developer Experience" (DevX/DX). This is unlikely to be anything within a core platform but often encompasses ownership of more peripheral product assets such as documentation, SDKs, sample code, plugins, and integrations. The ownership of a documentation platform and the creation of docs can also fit either here or within product.
- **Customer success**: you sometimes see partner developer advocates or partner engineers within developer relations who work directly with customers to help them deploy, integerate, and customize a product. This is most often the case at developer-centric companies that have a partnership ecosystem of plugins or addons, but can sometimes be the case at pure API companies too. These roles more traditionally sit within Sales as Sale Engineers.
- **Developer-focused marketing**: ranging from customer enablement through tutorials, screencasts, and onboarding emails, to acquisitional or brand awareness marketing. Yes, DevRel does indeed do marketing; occasionally very tradiational marketing such as sponsorship and paid advertisement for brand awareness and acquisition, but should spend the majority of time focused on education. The line can get a little blurred here with developer experience which spans the Product and Engineering points, above.

What activities you'll need your DevRel roles to undertake from the above will depend on:

- Identified gaps in what your existing teams are doing but aren't going to take on.
- What activities should be handed off from other team functions to allow them to focus elsewhere.
- Company stage of growth or strategic shift that introduces the need, increases the need, or identifies an opportunity for DevRel.

### At PostHog...

PostHog has seen significant growth over the past year resulting in a [Series B raise](https://posthog.com/blog/15-million-series-b). Following this, James and Tim, our co-founders, decided it was the right time to introduce dedicated DevRel roles (I'm particularly pleased about this because it means I now get to work here!). Prior to this, all potential DevRel activities were spread across other team members. But, because PostHog is a developer-centric company, operates with [small teams](/handbook/people/team-structure/why-small-teams), and embraces [stepping on toes](/handbook/company/values#step-on-toes), it's important for people to continue to do what's required to ship. There are, however, a number of gaps and opportunities where DevRel can make improvements or begin new activities.

In the near term, our priorities are:

1. **Oversee documentation**: this isn't about dictating how documentation is written or being any sort of gate keeper. It's about encouraging and enabling consistency, having the time to iterate on content that could otherwise become stale, and identifying gaps based on analysis, feedback, or experience. Devrel, much like our [amazing design team](/handbook/people/team-structure/design), can function as a service team with people deployed to the small team that most requires them at that time.
2. **Catalyze our community**: we have a thriving community across [our GitHub repos](https://github.com/posthog) and the [PostHog community Slack](/slack). On GitHub we reward contributions with thanks on our READMEs, a listing on the [Contributors page](/contributors) of our website, and credit for our [merch store](https://merch.posthog.com). But we want to do more to build upon this fantastic foundation because [community is core to our business](/handbook/strategy/business-model#why-would-you-work-on-the-community-edition).
3. **Engage with broader developer communities**: right now the only community we actively engage with is the one we've built. We need to expand our reach and build relationships within communities that will benefit from the PostHog platform.

## What DevRel roles do you need?

The roles you need depend on the focus and activities to be undertaken by people within DevRel roles.

The most frequently found roles within developer relations and the activities they undertake are<sup>†</sup>:

- **Developer Advocate**: A generalist role who likely takes on numerous DevRel activities. This role is also the role you'd expect to see out representing your brand within external communities.
- **[Developer] Community Manager**: Responsibilities will range from defining programs that enable community engagement and growth, to event management.
- **Developer Educator**: A role focused on content and code samples that educates developers. Normally expected to focus on written and video content.
- **Developer Evanglist**: Like the developer advocate this is a generalist role traditionally associated with marketing focused activities.
- **Developer Relations Engineer**: A newer catch-all job title for a code-focused role within DevRel.
- **Developer Experience Engineer**: Focusing on the experience that developers have when using a product. This can cover documentation, API standands and specs, SDKS, code samples, integrations, and various other assets that directly touch the developer customer.

### At PostHog...

We'll hire based on our activities priority list:

1. **Oversee documentation**: a role we're actively hiring for is a [Developer Educator](https://apply.workable.com/posthog/j/F928106DB5/) who will focus on documentation and enabling our existing customer-base and enabling Data Engineers easily integrate with PostHog. We've gone with this role over Technical Writer (omitted from the list, above, because it's a very broad job title) because, although the initial focus is docs, we do want this person to engage with the community and create other types of educational content in the future. I would very much like to hire a Tech Writer in the future to help provide even more structure and standardization to our docs.
2. **Catalyze our community**: the next hire will be a Community Programs Manager.
3. **Engage with broader developer communities**: once we've identified key external communities we'll hire a Developer Advocate with the interests and skills required to authentically engage with those communities.

## How do you start and grow DevRel?

In early stage startups that feel they need developer relations the go-to hire is frequently a Developer Advocate because this person will likely have to do a bit of everything. The company is probably still trying to work out what DevRel will do.

The other roles that are sometimes the first DevRel hires are Technical Writers and Developer Educators because documentation, sample code, and great developer content is fundamental to developer-focused products. It's likely that the Developer Educator role has more of a focus on community engaging activities such as blog post and video creation.

As a company grows there will be more specialization. This isn't specific to DevRel and is common across many functions.

![TODO: DevRel growth by function image]()

You many begin by hiring one or more generalist Developer Advocates who will contribute to docs, update and maintain SDKs, create sample code, and engage with external communities. It's also likely that you'll need to bring a Community Manager onboard to directly engage and facilitate wider engagement with communities.

As the company, and thus DevRel team grows, you're likely going to need roles that specialize and create a Developer Experience team of Technical Writers/Developer Educators and Developer Experience Engineers that focus on documentation, SDKs, and sample code. Developer Advocates will then shift focus to more community engagement activities such as workshops, meetups, speaking, and continuously gathering feedback either directly from developers or though identifying technology trends within communities. It's very possible that you may create a Developer Education team focused on blog and video content because 2020 has clearly demonstrated the value of companies having such dedicated developer content teams.

As this growth-fueled shift takes place it's important to understand that you're changing the definition - or at least the potential breadth - of roles. You may lose people who like being a generalist unless you can continue to allow them to contribute outside of their specialization. For example, Developer Advocates are likely hands-on coders so when shifting ensure they still have opportunities to contribute to docs, SDKs, and sample code.

### At PostHog...

I've been hired as the first person in developer relations and I've spent some time working on docs, engaging with our community on GitHub and Slack, have organized some newsletter sponsorship, and am taking a look and upgrading our swag/merch. I'm the generalist first hire.

The "What DevRel roles do you need?" section outlines our likely short-term hiring plan of Developer Educator, Community Programmes Manager, a Developer Advocate, and ideally a Technical Writer. Beyond that I can see a few opportunities for growth:

- **More Developer Educators**: I clearly see the benefit of more Developer Educators joining the team to ensure that we have content that enables developers to be success in deploying, maintaining, scaling, integrating, and extending (see [plugins](https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/plugins)) the PostHog open source platform. As we grow I can see people in these roles specializing on either existing customer education (activation) or using educational content to reach new developers (acquistion). A rotation schedule<sup>††</sup> could be put in place to ensure there some 
- **Developer Advocates for external communities**: As we identify key external communities there's a definite benefit to having developer advocates focused on those external communities. At Nexmo/Vonage we hired language (JS, Python, Ruby, PHP, C# .NET, Java etc.) developer advocates. At PostHog the advocacy roles are more likely to be focused on general technology trends such as Jamstack Advocate (Next.js, Gatsby, Supabase, Sanity.io, Netlify, Vercel etc.) and Data Cloud Advocate (Snowflake, Data Bricks, Google/BigQuery, Microsoft Azure/SQL Data Warehouse, ETL platforms, etc.).
- Create a startup program: In the same way every company needs to be able to send email to engage with their customers, every company needs to understand and improve how their customers are using their product. I use this analogy because SendGrid spent a lot of time and effort working with startup communities and saw a lot of success. So, working with startup incubators and accelerators to ensure PostHog is the go-to product analytics platform is a no-brainer to me. Beginning this in FinTech may be a good approach since it will align with our focus on companie who have a fundamental need for privacy and data control.

_<sup>††</sup> I can see value in a rotation schedule being across multiple DevRel roles and also into non-DevRel roles_

As things stand I don't believe we're going to form a DevRel team. Instead, DevRel roles will reside within [small teams](/handbook/people/team-structure/why-small-teams) providing DevRel skills to those teams as they need them. If we grow as outlined above I can see teams being formed that consist mainly of DevRel roles with a focus on experience, education and marketing.

Exactly how we grow will change with the company needs but this gives us a few directions we could potentially go in.

## How do you scale DevRel?

There are two parts to this:

1. A team structure empowers and provides focus.
2. A transparent change management process that ensures the team can provide input and feedback.

### An empowering team structure

I've already covered that with growth comes specialization. Specialization represents focus and a team will ultimately be able to deliver more than if they can focus; a team asked to purely focus on developer content creation will deliver more than a team asked for write docs, update SDKS, write sample code, write blog posts, manage and present on Twitch streams, and speak at events. Team structure can be **Functional**, **Multi-Functional**, or **Regional**, but the DevRel roles should be focused.

Examples of **Functional** and focused DevRel teams are:

- **Developer Experience**: API standards, documenation, code samples, SDKs, libraries, other tooling that enables developers.
- **Developer Education**: Developer enabling content covering documentation, blog posts, static video, live video, and other educational materials.
- **Community**: Creating and managing programs for customers, partners, and third-party communities. At some companies this team can also support and enable community within the company.
- **Integrations & Partnerships**: Integrations with third-party technologies that are used by developers, direct integrations with key customers, or helping build an ecosystem with partners such as those seen with Slack apps, Salesforce apps etc.

In a **Multi-Functional** team setup where a team consists of Product Managers, Engineers, DevRel roles, and Marketing roles, the specialization may change from sprint to sprint as a product moves through the product lifecycle; from inception/proof of concept through to a go-to-market phase. This can be a good setup for a generalist developer advocate to apply their broad range of skills but still have time to focus as product development progresses.

For example, the DevRel role's focus may shift:

- **Proof of Concept**: at this stage the person in the DevRel role may be "customer zero" providing feedback and acting as a customer.
- **Development**: Continuing to act as "customer zero" as well as preparing the assets and structure for the beta (or other early access) program.
- **Beta**: Executing on the beta plan, using this stage to raise awareness and excitement with developers, enabling developers with the product, and getting product feedback.
- **Go-to-market**: Ramping up awareness, acquisition, and activation activities.

**Regional** teams are are often multi-functional but, as you'd expect, focus on a specific location. You'll most likely see this as a the number of DevRel roles at a company gets to a point where it's possible to justify having North American, European, and Asian regional teams.

It's always important to be collaborative. But there's also a lot of value in not having to collaborate on absolutely everything to get something done. Therefore, a team should be **empowered** as much as possible to be able to do everything they need to get stuff done. This means equipment, software, skills, authority, budget, and more. If you're leading a DevRel team this most definitely means support. You're role as a leader of a DevRel team - and any empowered team - is to support and enable that team, not tell them what to do. This takes us nicely into the next point.

### Change management

I'll admit this sounds very _enterprisy_, but change management isn't something that should only happen in enterprise organizations. I've experienced change being handled really badly at both startups and enterprises, and it's because I've felt the pain of poorly managed change and managed the fallout it causes that I know it's so important.

The approach **not** to take to this is:

1. Arbitrarily assign a person or team to make a change.
2. That team dictates the change with the support of the company executives without asking for any feedback.

A simple yet much better approach is:

1. Identify that a change should be made.
2. Identify key stakeholders.
3. Assign one or more people as responsible for proposing the change. Ideally include stakeholders within this team.
4. Share the process that is about to be undertaken, when details will be shared, and when opportunities for input and feedback will happen, and that the team responsible for the change will ultimately make a decision.
5. Allow the team to do their work and come up with one or more potential changes.
6. Get feedback and iterate. More iterations means more time.
7. The team thanks everyone for their feedback, shares the decision, and explains why the decision was made.

TODO: why the above approach is the right one.

### At PostHog...

... it's just too early to know if DevRel will need to scale significantly. But I'll ensure we approach it as outlined in this section.

## What function will DevRel be part of?

- Where goals align
- Where the people in the DevRel roles have the best understanding and support from leadership

For the first time _ever_ we are looking to hire 3 interns at PostHog. We very, very rarely hire people with no experience so this is a huge opportunity to join a genuinely world class tech team at a company that is rocketing in growth.

Competition will be fierce, this is how to get a spot.

## Criteria

* You must have less than 1 year of professional experience as a software developer (!)
* You must be based between GMT+2 to GMT-8

## The competition

Between today and the 30th of September, we are looking for the best new product to be built into PostHog.

You can build _whatever_ you want. We have plenty of public info in terms of what we care about.

We are looking for:

* products we could actually ship to real users (our strategy: ["to provide every tool needed to build successful products"](https://posthog.com/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist#provide-every-tool-needed-to-build-successful-products))
* things that have an impressive amount of scope

Go nuts - build a CRM, build a customer support, or something else.

## Rules

* We will offer up to the best 3 submissions a (well paid) internship at PostHog and $25K (USD)
* You need to accept the intership to receive the cash prize. The internship will be well paid.
* If we don't get any good submissions, we may award no one, but think that's very unlikely
* We own your work - we may even choose to ship your prouct for real.
* You must tell us roughly how much work you put into it to the nearest half a day
* You must publish your work as a fork of [PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog).

## The internship

* We will have you do 3 months of paid work with us. We'll pay you in line with a junior role on our public pay calculator.
* We will interview you ahead of accepting you as an intern.
* If you are successful, we will extend a full time offer to you to join as a full stack engineer afterwards.

## Submission

* Please create a PR to the PostHog main repo (github.com/posthog/posthog) with your submission by midnight the 30th of September.
* Please also send us your resumé and/or LinkedIn profile
* You _must_ include a loom video talking us through what you built

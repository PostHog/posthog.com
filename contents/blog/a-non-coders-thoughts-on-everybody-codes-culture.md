One of PostHog’s core values is that everybody codes. That doesn’t mean everyone needs previous experience as a software developer, but we do encourage everyone to learn and practice the basics of shipping, no matter what their role is. 

When we’re hiring developers this isn’t an issue. However it can be intimidating for candidates who don’t have developer experience, even if they are otherwise technically literate. This is because our tools are centralized around GitHub, so even writing this blogpost involves knowing how to submit Pull Requests. 

As someone who recently joined PostHog, there were three things which helped set me up for success when using these tools for the first time. 

## Getting started early
There’s a lot to be done when joining a new company and intimidating tasks can end up deprioritized - especially if they’d normally fall outside your remit. 

One of the best things PostHog’s team did was push against this and get me started with coding as soon as possible. This included sharing videos about GitHub fundamentals before I started and setting up tools such as Visual Studio Code with me. It was clear this needed to be a point of focus. 

As a result, I set out to update the Team page as a test of my abilities. It only required editing a single .md file, but was a way to build confidence and do a first pull request. We’ve since added this task to our onboarding process too, so future team members will have a similar experience.

## Having realistic limits
Part of what can make an ‘everyone codes’ culture intimidating is that it can be hard to know what you are expected to do and when to ask for help.

I experienced this when [my next update](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/1416#issuecomment-849687634) required work in React. I didn’t know it was React because I couldn’t recognise it as such and it’s hard to get help from Google if you don’t know how to ask the right questions. It was a total blocker. 

Thankfully, our Engineering team is amazingly communicative and supportive. They helped me understand the problem and, more importantly, when I should be delegating. Setting realistic limits and building a supportive atmosphere are crucial for a successful coding culture.

## Making mistakes
An additional element of our culture is that w[e always bias for action](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture), but this can be daunting when you’re doing something for the first time. What if you get it wrong? What if you break the website or create a product bug?

This isn’t the way it works, of course. GitHub has reviews built in so that it’s hard to make such big mistakes and easy to roll back if needed. What feels high-risk to a novice isn’t actually risky at all and we can afford to be bullish as a result. 

I’ve made [many minor mistakes](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/1475#issuecomment-860511537) and, each time, someone has stepped in with helpful and timely feedback rather than admonishment. In this way, mistakes reinforce our culture and help everyone to learn faster while continuing to move forward. 

Ultimately, while I was initially nervous about the ‘everyone codes’ culture which PostHog has built, it hasn’t taken me long to start seeing benefits. As a team we can move faster; as individuals we can have greater impact with less bureaucracy - as shown when I made [my first product update](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/4584) in only my second week.

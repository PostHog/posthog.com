- TODO Joe to list highlights

### Plugins are now Apps

TODO: Joe to explain why plugin are now apps and how bright the future is. https://posthog.com/apps

### New: Filtering groups - AND/OR
SCREENSHOT

1 sentence description to be expanded upon by Joe

### New: Multi-dashboard insights

Got an insight you'd like to have on two dashboards at the same time? Previously you had to duplicate it and keep the copies in sync all the time. PostHog 1.36 allows you to simply add an insight to multiple dashboards. No hassle.

### New: Universal Search

Search for _anything_ within the current PostHog project from one place. That's Universal Search – the new power of the familiar "Search" box in the top bar.

<img src={UniversalSearchImage} alt='Universal search box' style={{width: 855 }} />

### New: Full timezone support in Insights

### New: Funnels redesign

We've heard your feedback about Funnels taking up a bit much space and not being easy to read on dashboards. The redesigned interface addresses both points with style, making Funnels more useful than ever.

### Improved: More pleasant and accessible data colors

You'll notice an updated color palette in most Insights (specifically: Trends, Funnels, Retention, and Stickiness). It's more pleasing to the eye, but it's not just about aesthetics – accessibility is equally important to us, and so the new scheme is much more colorblind-friendly at the same time.

### New: Multi-point persons modal

### Improved: Preflight checks

When self-hosting PostHog, it's crucial that all components are up and running, which is why the preflight checks screen is the first thing you see when setting up a fresh instance. Our new version of this screen makes initial setup of your instance all the more pleasant.

### New: Restack joins the PostHog Marketplace

[Restack](https://posthog.com/marketplace/restack) is a platform for deployiong open-source software stacks on Kubernetes and is run by a team of open-source enthusiasts. It's a natural match for [the PostHog Marketplace](https://posthog.com/marketplace/), where we've steadily grown the number of businesses offering services and support over the last few months. 

Restack enables you to deploy and benefit from a self-hosted PostHog instance, but without the maintenance busy work. Best of all, Restack Console can ensure that deployments are [HIPAA](/docs/privacy/hipaa-compliance), FISMA and SOC2 compliant — handy if you deal with a lot of [PII](/blog/what-is-personal-data-pii). Find out more in [the Marketplace, or head to [Restack's store listing for PostHog](https://www.restack.io/store/posthog) to find more great videos like the one above!

### Other improvements & fixes

Version 1.36 also adds hundreds of other fixes and improvements, including...

- **Improved**: Median conversion time is now presented in funnel insights, offering results that are more resistant to being skewed by outliers. The average continues to be available in detailed results.
- **Improved**: The in-app plugin source code editor has been divided into tabs, to make editing `plugin.json` and `index.ts` slightly more intuitive. Additionally, code is now automatically formatted with `prettier` on save.

### Deprecation and removal notices

- The previous update, [PostHog 1.35.0](blog/the-posthog-array-1-35-0), changed SAML from being instance-based to domain-based. This means that SAML configuration takes place in the PostHog UI. You can have multiple SAML providers on the same instance (segment by domain, from the user's email address). Please review our [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.
- If you use SAML on a self-hosted instance and have enabled SAML enforcement (previously `SAML_ENFORCED` environment variable) then this environment configuration has been deprecated too. You will now need to configure SSO enforcement via Authentication domains. Check the [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.
- TODO Slightly different payloads for `onEvent`, `onShapshot` and `onAction` plugin functions (clarification needed from @macobo)

[**Patch 1.36.1**](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/compare/release-1.36.0...release-1.36.1): This update addresses an issue where some deployments, right after upgrading to 1.36.0, required a restart to fully ingest events again. If you're already on 1.36.0, you only need to update if your instance has problems ingesting events.

### Changed: Plugins are now Apps

You may have noticed that we recently changed the name of our plugins, rebranding them to Apps. On the surface this may seem like a simple cosmetic change, but it plays in to the growing capability of ~~plugins~~ apps on PostHog.

We'll have more to share about [what's possible with apps](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/9654#issuecomment-1133222836) in the future. For now you can check out [our refreshed library](/apps) and a handful of new apps for services such as Amazon Kinesis and [Intercom](/apps/intercom). Enjoy!

### New: AND/OR filtering

<img src={AndOrFilteringImage} alt="AND/OR filters" style={{ width: 720 }} />

A frequent request in [feedback calls](https://calendly.com/posthog-feedback) is for more powerful filtering options when creating insights. Specifically, for AND/OR filtering. Finally, we've delivered exactly that.

AND/OR operators can now be used in filters to mix and match conditions into new combinations and identify new sorts of user behaviour. We're still interested in any other requests you may have though, so why not [schedule a feedback call](https://calendly.com/posthog-feedback) and let us know your suggestions?

### New: Multi-dashboard insights

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src={InsightOnMultipleDashboardsImage} alt='"Add insight to dashboards" modal' style={{ width: 502 }} />
</div>

Got an insight you'd like to have on two dashboards at the same time? Previously you had to duplicate it and keep the copies in sync all the time. What a pain!

Now, from PostHog 1.36 onwards, you can add a single insight to multiple dashboards at once. That means you don't need to worry about maintaining multiple insights and keeping all those copies in sync! Check [the dashboard docs](/docs/user-guides/dashboards) for more info.

### New: Universal search

<img src={UniversalSearchImage} alt="Universal search box" style={{ width: 855 }} />

Ever struggled to find an old insight, event or cohort in your PostHog project? We've added universal search to the familiar "Search" box in the top navigation, so now you have one tool you can use to find _anything_ on PostHog.

### New: Timezone support for insights

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src={TimezoneImage} alt='Insight tooltip in Eastern Daylight Time"' style={{ width: 322 }} />
</div>

PostHog projects have included a timezone setting since [version 1.24](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-24-0), enabling you to manually convert dates and times shown in the app. But 1.36 takes it to the next level.

As of 1.36, all insights queries take into account the timezone you've set in your Project Settings, enabling more accurate results for projects using timezones other than UTC. This is especially helpful when grouping data by day, week, or month!

### New: Redesigned Funnels

<img src={NewFunnelVizImage} alt="A three-step funnel in the new UI on the insight page" style={{ width: 970 }} />

Ever thought funnels on PostHog take up a bit too much space? Ever struggled to read longer funnels which are featured on a dashboard? You weren't the only one. That's why we redesigned them!

The new interface addresses the feedback we've heard, making funnels easier to use and clearer than ever. Check [the Funnels docs](/docs/user-guides/funnels) for more information about what's possible with funnels!

### Improved: A more accessible color palette

<img src={DataColorsImage} alt="A funnel with new data colors" style={{ width: 640 }} />

Speaking of design, you may have noticed we've updated the color palette in most Insights (specifically: [Trends](/docs/user-guides/trends), [Funnels](/docs/user-guides/funnels), [Retention](/docs/user-guides/retention), and [Stickiness](/docs/user-guides/stickiness)).

The new color palette is more pleasing to the eye, but the change isn't just aesthetic. It's also much more accessible for colorblind users. We want to continue improving accessibility in PostHog, so if you have specific feedback on this topic then please [let us know](https://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal) or [create an issue](https://github.com/PostHog)!

### Improved: Switch between series in the persons modal

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src={MultiPointPersonsModalImage} alt="Switching between series in the persons modal" style={{ width: 621 }} />
</div>

Thanks to the new series selector, the Persons modal is easier to use with multi-series Trends insights. In fact, you can now switch between series without ever having to close the window, quickly zooming in on particular user segments - just like in the GIF above!

### Improved: Preflight checks

<img src={PreflightImage} alt="New preflight checks screen" style={{ width: 627 }} />

When self-hosting PostHog, it's crucial that all components are up and running, which is why the preflight checks screen is the first thing you see when setting up a fresh instance. Our new version of this screen makes initial setup of your instance all the more pleasant!

### New: Restack joins the PostHog Marketplace

Restack is a platform for deployiong open-source software stacks on Kubernetes and is run by a team of open-source enthusiasts. It's a natural match for the PostHog Marketplace, where we've steadily grown the number of businesses offering services and support over the last few months.

Restack enables you to deploy and benefit from a self-hosted PostHog instance, but without the maintenance busy work. Best of all, Restack Console can ensure deployments are [HIPAA](/docs/privacy/hipaa-compliance), FISMA and SOC2 compliant — handy if you deal with a lot of [PII](/blog/what-is-personal-data-pii). Find out more in [the Marketplace, or head to Restack's store listing for PostHog](https://www.restack.io/store/posthog) to find more great videos like the one above!

### Other improvements & fixes

Version 1.36 also adds hundreds of other improvements and fixes, including...

-   **New**: Median conversion time is now presented in funnel insights, offering results that are more resistant to being skewed by outliers. The average continues to be available in detailed results. [#9810](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9810)
-   **Improved**: The in-app plugin source code editor has been divided into tabs, to make editing `plugin.json` and `index.ts` slightly more intuitive. Additionally, code is now automatically formatted with `prettier` on save. [#9795](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9795)
-   **Improved**: Large numbers are now presented with the comma as the thousands separator in Insights, greatly improving readability. [#9725](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9725) [#9733](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9733)
-   **Improved**: Properties table column sizing has been made smarter, making them scale better for various contents of properties. [#9502](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9502)
-   **Fixed**: User Paths with start/end points containing trailing slashes work now. It's also been made impossible to unselect all event categories for a more intuitive experience. [#9482](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9482)
-   **Fixed**: Trends insight displayed as a table can be sorted independently on dashboards. [#9625](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9625)
-   **Fixed**: Custom series names are included in CSV exports. [#9677](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9677)
-   **Fixed**: Automatic provisioning of PostHog users logging in with SSO has been made more reliable. For instance, users who first logged-in _before_ automatic provisioning was turned on for the organization, will be automatically added to it when they log in again. [#9515](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9515)
-   **Fixed**: The UI again always shows the correct active license. [#9575](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/9575)

### Deprecation and removal notices

-   **For SAML admins:** The previous update, [PostHog 1.35.0](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-35-0), changed SAML from being instance-based to domain-based. This means that SAML configuration takes place in the PostHog UI. You can have multiple SAML providers on the same instance (segment by domain, from the user's email address). Please review our [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.
-   **For SAML admins:** If you use SAML on a self-hosted instance and have enabled SAML enforcement (previously `SAML_ENFORCED` environment variable) then this environment configuration has been deprecated too. You will now need to configure SSO enforcement via Authentication domains. Check the [SSO docs](/sso#authentication-domains) for more details.
-   **For ~~plugin~~ app developers:** `onEvent`, `onShapshot` and `onAction` event payloads have been cleaned up a bit. Specifically, `timestamp`, `$set`, and `$set_once` are always provided now, while `now`, `sent_at`, `site_url`, `offset`, as well as `kafka_offset` are no longer included. All apps available in our [App Store](https://posthog.com/apps) are compatible with this change. `processEvent` is unaffected.

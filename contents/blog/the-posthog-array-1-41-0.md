## 1.41.0 update guide for self-hosted users
Due to changes in this update, it is important check `alias` usage before [upgrading PostHog](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog) to 1.41.0 on a self-hosted instance. Further [information is available in the docs](/docs/integrate/identifying-users#considerations), but for example, assuming `email` is used as the identified user id, then: 

```
identify(email)                     # in the frontend
alias(email, backend_unique_id)     # in the backend - this works
alias(backend_unique_id, email)     # in the backend - THIS WILL NOT WORK
```

> **If you haven't run async migration 0007 before:** Upgrade to 1.41 and then check [ingestion warnings](#new-ingestion-warnings) and solve any outstanding issues. After that run async migration 0007 at `<your-posthog-site>/instance/async_migrations` (if you haven't ran 0005 yet start with that, then 0006 and finally 0007).

> **If you have completed async migration 0007 before:** If you have changed anything regarding `alias` or based on ingestion warnings, you must re-run async migration 0007 on top of 1.41 by [connecting to Postgres](/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting#how-do-i-connect-to-postgres), running `UPDATE posthog_asyncmigration SET status = 0 WHERE name = '0007_persons_and_groups_on_events_backfill' AND status = 2;` and re-running 0007 at `<your-posthog-site>/instance/async_migrations`.

### New: Persons on events on by default

We used to store events in one table and persons in another table. That meant that, once you reached billion event scale, any query which touched person properties would time out. But, no longer! After running [an extensive beta since update 1.39.0](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-39-0#beta-improving-query-performance-by-combining-persons-and-events), we've now added person data onto the events themselves.

You won’t see any UI changes as a result of this change — persons will still have their own Persons & Groups section on the sidebar, for example — but you will notice results are a lot (up to 400%!) faster for any queries involving persons and events. This is a massive change, so be sure to [read the full announcement for more info](/blog/persons-on-events).

> **Note:** As a result of adding persons on events and changing how queries work we now have to be more strict about merging users. Because of that, we recommend double checking your `alias` calls, and following advice above [how to upgrade a self-hosted instance to 1.41.0](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-41-0). 

### New: Count of events per user

![count events per user](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-count-events-per-user.png)

Have you ever asked yourself '*What's the average average number of purchases per user?*' or '*What's the maximum number of forms submitted per user?'* 

Questions like these used to be hard to answer with PostHog, but no more! Use the new "Count per user" aggregation mode available in Trends to analyze _how intensely_ your users use the product and its features. "Count per user" supports common statistical functions for crunching the per-user numbers: average, median, minimum, maximum, 90th/95th/99th percentile.

**Bonus:** While working on this feature, we also took the opportunity to improve our aggregation selector UI: aggregation by property value is now presented with more clarity.

### Improved: Recordings interface

![recordings interface](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-recordings-interface.png)

We've heard feedback recently that session recording was incredibly useful, but didn't spark much joy for those who used it. So, we've overhauled the entire interface for session recordings to make it easier to use and to help you find relevant recordings faster. 

We think session recording feels like an entirely new experience now, so check it out. Now's the perfect time to explore [the console log too](/manual/recordings#console-logs-recording-beta)!

### New: Text cards on dashboards

![text cards on dashboards](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-text-card-on-dashboard.png)

Previously there was no easy way to add context or links to a dashboard, meaning you may have to send long explanations when sharing a dashboard with teammates. That's why we've added the option for users on paid plans to add text cards where they can add any information they want, including metadata, images or gifs!

### New: Ingestion warnings

![ingestion warnings](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-ingestion.png)

We've added a new page to the Data Management section which lists warnings related to data ingestion from the past 30 days. If you still try to merge identified users into others, the Ingestion Warning page is where we'll remind you that the merge got blocked.

> **Note:** Self-hosted users managing kafka separately should create a new topic `clickhouse_ingestion_warnings` manually.

### New: App metrics

![app metrics](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-app-metrics-insight.png)

Curious how well your apps are doing? Previously, you may have had to pour over the AWS logs, but now you can head to the new app metrics page to find out how many events an app has processed, how many retries were attempted and what errors may have occured. Very handy. Want to take a look? Head to the apps page in your instance and click the chart symbol for any installed app.  

App metrics are only available for users on Scale or Enterprise plans. 

> **Note:** Self-hosted users managing kafka separately should create a new topic `clickhouse_app_metrics` manually.

### New: View recordings from anywhere

![view recordings from anywhere1](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-view-recordings-anywhere1.png)

![view recordings from anywhere2](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-view-recordings-anywhere2.png)

You can now view session recordings from lots of different places within PostHog, making it easier to find relevant recordings.

Curious about how a specific person is interacting with your app? Navigate to a person detail page and check out their recordings. Want to see recordings for a specific event or action you've created? Check out the new view recordings button you can find in the event's detail page or from the events table.

### New: Change your own email

![change your password](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-password.png)

Finally, we can release one of our most requested features: the ability to change the email address attached to your account, without contacting support. All you have to do is select your profile picture in the top right and access your account settings. 

### New: Hedgehog mode

![hedgehog mode](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-hedgehog-mode.png)

For a while now, we've been having a hard time explaining to our families what we do for a living. This makes it even harder.

### Improved: Formula mode in Trends

![Trends query editor with the formula mode tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4550621/194917357-81f0f06d-2994-420b-b566-ef67d1e7d010.png)

We've seen that the relationship between Trends series and formula was a bit unintuitive at times. To alleviate this, we've reworked the experience of our formula feature. Instead of an "Add formula" button, click "Enable formula mode" – "Series" then become "Variables", and the formula itself is presented right below them.

### One more thing: Site apps 

![site-apps](../images/blog/array/1-41-0-site-apps.gif)

We're testing a new big (beta) thing: site apps. You need to **manually opt in** to enable this feature by configuring your `posthog-js` initialization to include `opt_in_site_apps: true`. Once you do, PostHog will be able to inject code onto your website through `posthog-js`. We've put together [a tutorial that explains how to make a site app](/tutorials/build-site-app) if you're interested. 

Site apps can be useful for a number of potential tasks, such as displaying feedback forms, posting service update banners, or making it rain pineapples. No, we're not really sure why we made the last one either. 

### Other improvements & fixes

You think that's it? Not by a long shot! Version 1.41 also adds hundreds of other improvements and fixes, including...

- **Improvement:**  You can now [send analytics events from GitHub actions, to PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-github-action)

- **Improvement:**  We have revamped our timezone system! We've squashed various bugs and improved the interval grouping to be more in line with expectations when filtering on dates.

- **Fix:** WAU/MAU aggregation in Trends was quietly always grouped by day, even if a different interval (hour/week/month) was selected. Additionally, those modes showed zero users for periods with no relevant events, even if the real count should have been non-zero due to WAU/MAU being a trailing count. Both issues are now fixed, and we've expanded our test coverage of those aggregation modes to ensure their results are accurate going forward.

- **Fix**: Experiment results will appear immediately after the first exposure to a user

- **Improvement**: The experiments table is now sortable

- **Improvement**: Hold down "shift" when using the toolbar to click on elements below the heatmap.

### New: Count of events per user

PICTURE GOES HERE

*Average number of purchases per user? Maximum number of forms submitted per user?* 
Questions like these used to be hard to answer, but no more! Introducing "count of events per user".

### Improved: Math selector

PICTURE GOES HERE

Work on the previous task had us redo the math selector.

### New: Text cards on dashboards

PICTURE GOES HERE

Would you like to add some metadata or clarifications on your dashboards? Now you can! Hint: gifs are metadata too! 

### Improved: Recordings interface

PICTURE GOES HERE

We've been listening and implementing the most requested features, with a special focus on sparking joy. 
It's like a completely new app now, so check it out! 

### New: Plugin metrics

PICTURE GOES HERE

Curious how well your plugins are doing? You no longer have to read smoke signals in AWS logs - just use the new Plugin Metrics page. 

### New: Persons on events on by default

PICTURE GOES HERE

We used to store events in one table and persons in another. Any query that touched person properties would require 
database level JOINs and time out, once you reached the billion event scale. No longer! By moving person data
onto the events themselves, we eliminated a whole class of performance issues üöÄ.

### New: Alias changes

PICTURE GOES HERE

The above change required us to be strict about who's a identified user and who's not. Because of that, you might
benefit from double checking your `identify` and `alias` calls. The new rule is this: only anonymous users can be
aliased into other users. Once you call `identify` on a user, you can no longer alias this user into another identified
user. 

### New: Ingestion warnings

PICTURE GOES HERE

In case you still try to alias identified events, there's a new Ingestion Warnings page to remind you that it's a bad idea. 

### New: Groups caching chagnes

PICTURE GOES HERE

### Finally: Change your email yourself

PICTURE GOES HERE

One of our most requested features: you can now change your own email address without contacting support ü§©ü§©ü§©

### New: Hedgehog mode

PICTURE GOES HERE

For a while now, we've been having a hard trouble explaining to our spouses what we do for work. This makes it even harder.

### One more thing: Site apps 

PICTURE GOES HERE

We're testing a new big (beta) thing: site apps. You need to **manually opt in** to enable this feature. Once you do, 
PostHog apps will be able to inject code onto your website through posthog-js. For example to display a feedback form,
add a quick "THE APP IS DOWN, NO NEED TO PANIC" banner, or even make it rain pineapples. Again, we're having a really
hard time explaining to people this is what we do for work! üòç

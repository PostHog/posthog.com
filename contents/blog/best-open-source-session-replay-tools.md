Analytics is great when you need hard numbers, but hard numbers don't give you the full picture. What else do you need to do? [Talk to users](/blog/10x-engineers-do-user-interviews)? Sure. Gather feedback? That's useful, too. But, for us, there's nothing better than watching session replays for understanding a user's pain points.

Replays (aka session recordings) are a great way to understand:

- What causes bugs and user frustration.
- Where users are getting stuck on your site.
- Hesitation at different stages of your funnel.
- How your users are interacting with individual elements of your product.

Hotjar and Fullstory are popular session replay products, but they're expensive, inflexible, and primarily designed with marketing teams. In this guide, we're looking at the best free and open-source session replay tools, which often offer the same features (or more) for less.

> **Changelog:**
>
> - **Mar 16, 2023:** Removed SessionStack, added Highlight.io. Updated copy and screenshots.

## 1. PostHog
![PostHog - open source product analytics replay](../images/blog/open-source-hotjar-alternatives/img1_PostHog.png)

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is an all-in-one, Product OS that offers all the tools required to build better products, including but not limited to [session replay](/product/session-recording).

PostHog's session replay tool includes console logs and network activity, so you can identify the causes of bugs or performance problems. There's also a playlist feature, allowing you to save similar replays based on specific events or user properties into one list, and you can save recordings offline for safe keeping.

Other features include product analytics, [feature flags](/product/feature-flags), [funnels](/product/funnels), [heatmaps](/product/heatmaps), [experimentation](/product/experimentation-suite), [trends](/product/trends) and [much more](/product). 

All PostHog’s tools work together natively, offering extensive, actionable user insights beyond what's possible with standalone session replay tools.

### Who is PostHog for?

PostHog is ideal for [product-minded developers](/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer) and product teams. Unlike Hotjar and Fullstory, it's designed for technical users. Its broad range of features means PostHog can replace several tools.

- Export recordings offline
- Fully-featured product analytics suite

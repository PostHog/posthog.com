## #good-reads

[The Racecar Growth Framework](https://www.reforge.com/blog/racecar-growth-framework) by Dan Hockenmaier and Lenny Rachitsky – yes, that Lenny. An essential read that suggests thinking about your business like a race car, featuring:

- **The (Growth) Engine:** Growth loops (e.g. virality, performance marketing, content) that drive most of your growth.

- **Turbo Boosts:** One-off events (e.g. PR, events) that create a temporary spike in growth.

- **Lubricants:** Optimizations to improve the growth engine, such as improved onboarding or conversion rate.

- **Fuel:** The stuff that powers your engine, such as content, new users or capital.

[What Makes Developers Unhappy?](https://abinoda.substack.com/p/unhappiness), a summary of a large-scale study of over 2,000 developers. Takeaways:

- Reducing negative experiences is a more cost-effective way to improve happiness, and productivity, than "maximising positive experiences".

- The top cause of unhappiness among developers was "being stuck in problem solving", but the majority of the top 10 causes were external factors that managers can impact.

- The top external factors were, in order: time pressure, bad code quality / practice, underperforming colleagues, mundane / repetitive tasks, unexplained broken code, bad decision making, and imposed limitations on development.

[What I've learned from users](http://paulgraham.com/users.html) by Paul Graham. For Graham, "users" means founders of YC companies:

- Founders frequently don't listen to the advice of YC partners and live to regret it. Graham posits this is because "so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong."

- "The educational system in most countries trains you to win by hacking the test instead of actually doing whatever it's supposed to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup."

- "Focus is doubly important for early stage startups... If the founders focus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do."

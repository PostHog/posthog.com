LogRocket is a frontend monitoring platform which, like PostHog, combines multiple tools into one platform. In this article we’ll explain some of the biggest similarities and differences between PostHog and LogRocket, but here’s the short version:

- LogRocket focuses on helping frontend developers detect and solve issues. It offers tools such as session recording, analytics, and performance monitoring.

- PostHog is an all-in-one platform that helps teams build better products. It includes many of the same tools as LogRocket, including session recording, analytics and performance monitoring — but also extends to feature flags, A/B testing and more.

In this article, we will:

- Compare PostHog and LogRocket’s core features
- Examine PostHog and LogRocket’s library support
- Discuss what integrations are available with other tools
- Explore other frequently asked questions about PostHog and LogRocket

## How do PostHog and LogRocket differ?

### 1. PostHog does more than frontend monitoring

PostHog goes beyond frontend monitoring by augmenting product analytics and session recording with powerful product and data tools, such as feature flags, A/B testing, and SQL querying. While LogRocket’s focus on the frontend means it offers a few specialist features, PostHog offers greater value and is more widely useful for the majority of teams and organizations

### 2. PostHog is open source and transparent

PostHog is built with transparency at its core. Not only do we work in the open and give full access to [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), we also enable others to [build integrations](/docs/apps/build) or [other services on top of PostHog](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server), open their own PRs, or give feedback on [our roadmap](/roadmap). PostHog's open app framework makes it easy to integrate internal tools, an advantage closed-source products like LogRocket can't offer.

### 3. PostHog constantly ships new features

At PostHog, we ship weirdly fast. We update [our changelog](/blog/posthog-changelog) with a recap of new features every week, and often there’s even more in beta testing. And that’s without counting all the apps and integrations submitted by our community! We work hard to keep PostHog on the cutting edge and we’re transparent about the ways we do that.

## PostHog and LogRocket feature comparison

PostHog offers a much wider selection of tools than LogRocket, including several tools that are helpful to frontend developers — such as feature flags, and experimentation. PostHog is also entirely open source, meaning that it offers far greater transparency than LogRocket. You can even develop your own PostHog apps!

<ComparisonTable column1="LogRocket" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Track events and conversion; analyze user behavior" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users use your product; diagnose bugs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Feature flags" description="Roll out features safely; toggle features for cohorts or individuals" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="User surveys" description="Ask users for qualitative feedback and gather responses" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Experiments" description="Test changes and analyze impact" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Heatmaps" description="Track where users click" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Event pipelines" description="Push and pull data to enrich customer profiles" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Open source" description="Build your own apps and contribute code" />
</ComparisonTable>

-   **Feature flags:** PostHog offers robust, multivariate feature flags which support JSON payloads. This enables you to push real-time changes to your product without needing to redeploy. Visit [our feature flag page](/product/feature-flags) for more information. LogRocket doesn’t have any in-built feature flag functions.

-   **Experiments:** PostHog offers multivariate experimentation, which enables you to test changes and discover statistically relevant insights. Visit [the experimentation page](/product/experimentation-suite) for more information. LogRocket doesn’t have any in-built experimentation features.

-   **Open source:** PostHog is entirely open source, under a permissive MIT license. The biggest advantage for users is the ability to build on top of PostHog and to access the source code directly. [Our team also works in the open](/handbook/company/culture). LogRocket is not an open source company, nor is the product available under an open source license.

### Product analytics

While LogRocket contains some product analytics features, it isn’t primarily intended as an analytics platform and lacks many features that product managers and engineers may require. PostHog is a more capable product analytics platform, offering advanced features such as correlation analysis.

<ComparisonTable column1="LogRocket" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Graphs and trends" description="Build custom insights and visualizations" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Combine insights into shareable dashboards" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Funnels" description="Understand conversion between events, pages" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cohorts" description="Combine users based on properties and events for group analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="User paths" description="Track user flows and where they drop-off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Retention" description="Analyze user and revenue retention" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="UTM tracking" description="Track marketing campaigns with UTM tags" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Suggested events and properties that lead to success or failure" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Understand how organizations use your product" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Formulas" description="Use custom formulas to calculate unique insights" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Query editor" description="Write your own queries in SQL" />
</ComparisonTable>

-   **Correlation analysis:** This feature enables you to [automatically find correlated events or properties](/manual/correlation) which affect the conversion rate of users within a funnel. LogRocket doesn’t offer any such automated correlation discovery, meaning users must search for correlating factors manually and without assistance.

-   **Query editor:** LogRocket doesn’t currently support any way for users to interrogate data directly, either through SQL or other, abstracted query language. PostHog also doesn’t offer SQL queries... but [we’re actively working on it](/manual/hogql).

### Session replays

LogRocket and PostHog both offer robust, full-featured session replay tools that outperform even dedicated tools, such as [Hotjar](/blog/best-open-source-session-replay-tools). LogRocket’s session replay tool offers a handful of extra features, such as mobile recording, though PostHog is actively working on developing these.

<ComparisonTable column1="LogRocket" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web app recordings" description="Capture recordings from single-page apps" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="On the roadmap" feature="Mobile app recordings" description="Capture recordings in iOS and Android apps" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Identity detection" description="Link recordings to user IDs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Console logs" description="Capture extra content from a users’ browser environment" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Playlists" description="Sort recordings into static and dynamic playlists" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Performance monitoring" description="Track network events within a session" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Privacy masking" description="Censor personal information from playback" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Conditional recording" description="Only capture the sessions you want" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Export recordings" description="Take recordings in/out of the platform" />
</ComparisonTable>

-   **Mobile app recordings:** PostHog does not currently offer recordings for mobile apps, but it is something we’re actively working on. Check [our roadmap](/roadmap) for more info!

### Heatmaps and click tracking

LogRocket’s heatmap and click tracking functionality exceeds PostHog’s and enables you to visualize more precisely how users interact with your site at the aggregate level. PostHog’s [toolbar](/manual/toolbar) focuses on visualizing clicks, and enabling users to [quickly track such events within product analytics](/tutorials/toolbar).

<ComparisonTable column1="LogRocket" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Heatmaps" description="Visualize cursor movements on a page" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Clickmaps" description="Visualize where users click on a page" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Scrollmaps" description="Visualize how far down a page users scroll" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Eyetracking" description="Visualize precisely where users are looking on a page" />
</ComparisonTable>

**Toolbar:** PostHog’s heatmap functionality (technically, clickmapping) is accessed via the [toolbar](/manual/toolbar). It enables you to visualize clicks as an overlay on a live page, but also enables you to quickly create events and actions which can be analyzed using PostHog’s analytics features.

## Tracking & SDKs

**Tl;dr:** Both PostHog and LogRocket support a broad range of tracking options and libraries, and manual event instrumentation, as well as autocapture.

<ComparisonTable column1="LogRocket" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Event tracking" description="Track manually instrumented events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Automatically track events without instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Combined events" description="Track related events as a single trackable action or behavior" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Reverse proxy available" description="Send events from your own domain to capture more data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cross-domain tracking" description="Track users across domains and sub-domains" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Server-side tracking" description="Send events from your server" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Capture API" description="Send events through an API" />
</ComparisonTable>

> ### Should you autocapture events?
>
> LogRocket and PostHog both support manual instrumentation, as well as autocapture. Autocapture is much faster to setup, but some argue that it creates too much noise to be useful. We disagree, and it’s why PostHog gives you your first million events for free, every month — so you can capture events freely. [It’s something we feel quite strongly about](/blog/is-autocapture-still-bad).

### Library support

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Android" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Ruby" />
</ComparisonTable>

> ### PostHog library support
>
> PostHog supports a wide range of client and server libraries, but not all features are equally available across all of them. We recommend using PostHog's JavaScript snippet to enjoy all our features. See [our client library documentation](/docs/integrate?tab=snippet) for more information.

## Integrations and extensions

Both PostHog and LogRocket are capable of integrating with third-party tools in a variety of ways. This enables you to accomplish tasks such as exporting data to another platform, importing data for analysis, or enabling two-way communication between the tools.

[PostHog offers more than 50 integrations and apps](/apps), while [LogRocket offers slightly fewer](https://logrocket.com/features/integrations).

Got another question? You can [ask the PostHog team anything you want](/questions)!

### How much does LogRocket cost?

LogRocket has a complex pricing structure which isn’t fully transparent. Although it offers a free trial, this is limited to only 1,000 sessions per month. Beyond this, subsequent product tiers begin at $99 USD per month, depending on usage. This version does not include access to many features, such as product analytics.

More feature-rich product tiers begin at $550 USD per month, but increase depending on how many session are captured — and the per session cost is not clear. Pricing for the full version of LogRocket is not publicly available.

### How much does PostHog cost?

PostHog has transparent pricing based on usage. It’s free to get started and completely free for the first 1 million events and 5,000 sessions captured every month.

After this free monthly allowance you'll pay $0.00031/event and $0.04/recording, and PostHog charges progressively less the more you use. Volume, non-profit and [startup discounts](/startups) are available upon request, and we recommend trying [our pricing calculator](/pricing) to estimate your pricing.

### Do LogRocket and PostHog offer free trials?

LogRocket offers a free version of its basic product, which is limited to only 1,000 session captures per month. 14-day free trials are also available for other product tiers, after which users must pay to continue usage.

With PostHog, it’s free to get started and all users get their first 1 million events and 5,000 sessions for free, every month. Billing limits can be used to keep usage beneath this allowance, enabling you to use PostHog for free indefinitely.

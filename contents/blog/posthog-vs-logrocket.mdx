Want to know how PostHog and LogRocket compare? If you remember nothing else, remember these two things:

1. **LogRocket** is a frontend monitoring tool that helps developers detect and solve issues.

2. **PostHog** goes beyond just frontend monitoring by integrating powerful analytics, session replay, feature management, A/B testing tools into one platform.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. PostHog replaces multiple tools

LogRocket is a narrow tool. It does one thing – and it does it well. PostHog includes many of the same tools, such as session replay, [error tracking](/docs/error-tracking), and console logs, but augments them with powerful product and data tools, such as product analytics, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys. It's everything you need to both squash bugs _and_ understand every aspect of user behavior.

### 2. PostHog is open source and transparent

PostHog is built with transparency at its core. Not only do we work in the open and give full access to [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), we also enable developers to [build their own integrations](/docs/apps/build), open their own PRs, or give feedback on [our roadmap](/roadmap). PostHog's open app framework makes it easy to integrate internal tools, an advantage closed-source products like LogRocket can't offer.

### 3. PostHog constantly ships new features

We ship weirdly fast. We update [our changelog](/changelog) every week and often there’s even more features in beta testing. And that’s without counting all the apps and integrations submitted by our community! We work hard to keep PostHog on the cutting edge and we’re transparent about the ways we do that.

## Comparing PostHog and LogRocket

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'logrocket']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics',
        'web_analytics',
        'session_replay',
        'feature_flags',
        'surveys',
        'experiments',
        'heatmaps',
        'cdp',
        'platform.deployment.open_source',
    ]}
/>

-   **Feature flags:** PostHog offers robust, multivariate feature flags which support JSON payloads. This enables you to push real-time changes to your product without needing to redeploy. Visit [our feature flag page](/feature-flags) for more information. LogRocket doesn’t have any in-built feature flag functions.

-   **Experiments:** PostHog offers multivariate experimentation, which enables you to test changes and discover statistically relevant insights. Visit [the experimentation page](/experiments) for more information. LogRocket doesn’t have any in-built experimentation features.

### Product analytics

While LogRocket offers some product analytics features, it isn’t primarily intended as an analytics platform and lacks many things product managers and engineers require. PostHog is a more capable product analytics platform, offering advanced features such as correlation analysis, custom formulas, and a flexible SQL query editor.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'logrocket']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'dashboards',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'product_analytics.features.cohorts',
        'product_analytics.user_paths',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        { label: 'UTM tracking', description: 'Track marketing campaigns with UTM tags', customValue: true },
        'product_analytics.funnels.features.correlation_analysis',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'product_analytics.insights.features.formula_mode',
        'product_analytics.insights.features.sql_editor',
    ]}
/>

-   **Correlation analysis:** This feature enables you to [automatically find correlated events or properties](/manual/correlation) which affect the conversion rate of users within a funnel. LogRocket doesn’t offer any such automated correlation discovery, meaning users must search for correlating factors manually and without assistance.

### Session replay

LogRocket and PostHog both offer robust, full-featured [session replay tools](/blog/best-open-source-session-replay-tools) that outperform even dedicated tools, such as Hotjar.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'logrocket']}
    rows={[
        'session_replay.platform_support.features.web_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.platform_support.features.mobile_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.identity.features.identity_detection',

        'session_replay.targeting.features.conditional_recording',
        'session_replay.export.features.export_to_json',
    ]}
/>

- **Mobile app recordings:** Session replay for mobile apps is currently under development – see [our GitHub mega issue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/13267) for more.

### Heatmaps and click tracking

        'heatmaps.features.scrollmaps',
    ]}
/>

### Tracking & SDKs

**Tl;dr:** Both support a broad range of tracking options and libraries, and manual event instrumentation, as well as autocapture.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'logrocket']}
    rows={[
        { label: 'Event tracking', description: 'Track manually instrumented events', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Autocapture', description: 'Automatically track events without instrumentation', customValue: true },

        { label: 'Capture API', description: 'Send events through an API', customValue: true },
    ]}
/>

### Library support

PostHog supports a wide range of client and server libraries, but not all features are equally available across all of them. We recommend using PostHog's JavaScript snippet to enjoy all our features. See [our client library documentation](/docs/getting-started/install?tab=snippet) for more information.

### Data pipelines

[PostHog offers more than 50 integrations and apps](/cdp), while [LogRocket offers slightly fewer](https://logrocket.com/features/integrations). As an open-source application, PostHog welcomes contributions from the community. If an integration you need isn’t available, [it’s possible to create it](/docs/apps/build)!

## Frequently asked questions

Got another question? You can [ask the PostHog team anything you want](/questions)!

### How much does PostHog cost?

PostHog has transparent pricing based on usage with a generous free tier:

|                       | **Free usage per month** 
|-----------------------|--------------------------
| **Product analytics** | 1 million events        
| **Session replay**    | 5,000 recordings         
| **Feature flags**     | 1 million API requests
| **A/B testing**       | 1 million API requests  
| **Surveys**           | 1500 responses

We charge progressively less the more you use once you exceed your monthly free allowance. Volume, non-profit and [startup discounts](/startups) are also available. 

### How can I estimate my usage?

The easiest way is to [sign up to PostHog](https://us.posthog.com/signup), integrate our snippet, then check the projection on your billing page after a few days. Alternatively, you can guesstimate by multiplying your current monthly active users by an estimate of events generated per user – 50 to 100 per user is a good starting point. See [Estimating usage & costs](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) in our docs for more.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default).

### What about ad blockers?

We recommend all users deploy a reverse proxy, which enables you to send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain. Events sent from your own domain and are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers, ensuring you capture the best data possible. We have [reverse proxy setup guides](/docs/advanced/proxy) for AWS Cloudfront, Caddy, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, and more, in our docs.

### Can I use PostHog with a CDP? (Segment, Rudderstack, etc.)

Yes. See [Using PostHog with a CDP](/docs/advanced/cdp) in our docs.

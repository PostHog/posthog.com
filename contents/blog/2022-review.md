2022 was an exceptionally good year for PostHog. Here's my short review.

## How it went

### We grew very fast _and_ are much more durable

- Revenue grew nearly 6 times, without any outbound sales team
- We hit a 2 month [CAC payback period](https://www.thesaascfo.com/cac-payback-period/), salaries included. Around [12 months](https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/cac-payback-period/#:~:text=The%20general%20benchmark%20for%20startups,have%20greater%20access%20to%20capital.) is seen as exceptional.
- We are comfortably default alive and will likely be profitable in 2023

We still have work to do. We're working on gross margin - we've done close to zero cost optimization on our hosting so far, and we want to hit a higher absolute level of revenue (around $10M ARR) before we fundraise again.

## We let people go when we needed to 

We remained disciplined and let people go when we needed to. This helps us retain an ambitious and performance-oriented culture. Whilst these moments are painful, we received positive feedback from our team when we explained why we made these decisions, transparently. We are compassionate but reasonable (4 months notice - our attitude is letting people go earlier is better for everyone, a big payout for them is kinder in return, so having the the latter, means the former condition is met).

### Tim and I held each other accountable, and solved issues with our roles

At one point, I was getting the little things done, but not the big ones. Tim suggested I hire Kendal (Exec Assistant). She helped solve this.

At another stage, Tim and I realised we were managing the wrong teams because the game had changed. I was good at early sales, but he's the right person to help us scale things there. Likewise in product, we want to go from good to great and that'll take more design skill which I can help with. We swapped a bunch of priorities around with each other, and - so far - it feels much better!

### A crappy family situation got much better

My (then) 1 year old daughter got diagnosed with bilateral retinoblastoma (a type of cancer) in 2021. She lost an eye as a result, has her vision permanently damaged in the other, and had to go through chemo. We were delighted to wrap up treatment in the Spring 2022. We were lucky that it went perfectly... she was cured, and now we're in regular monitoring mode. When she got diagnosed, I chose to focus on revenue over fundraising (instead of trying to both whilst taking care of her), and now a year and a half on, I'm very glad that's what we picked.

### We are shipping stuff

We made too many improvements to list on user facing functionality, and infra / ingestion based functionality. It feels like we can make new things appear, although Q1 will be a big test - it'll be one of our most ambitious quarters.

Other teams also get their work out the door quickly, unimpeded by bureaucracy / excessive planning. We've had a ton of marketing content appearing, a smooth time with our People and Ops team, and a growth team that can't stop producing winning variants!

### I'm really glad we're not doing outbound / went for a growth team instead

It is always tempting to hire an outbound sales team. After all, we can sell the product and retain users, to a tightly defined audience.

However, it just feels like it'd be very hard to do outbound sales to developers. I can't think of a worse group to target this way (this is coming from a place of experience - I've run outbound sales teams before).

Instead, we set up a growth team. We've had dramatic results from doing this - such as 25% improvements in our activation flow from single experiments. Yep, one experiment has led to a 25% increase in our monthly growth, forever. That's why we have such a low CAC payback period...

If we _had_ hired a sales team, I guarantee we'd be focussing on how to send more cold emails more effectively versus the more leveraged work of improving our onboarding, activation and billing flows.

### We can take pride in not focussing on number of staff / investors

Lots of companies raised very hyped funding rounds in 2021 - we didn't. We are confident we made the right call not to do this, but we felt that we were going against the grain. It was really cool to talk about this stuff openly with our team, and to see how quickly we started taking pride in building a real company.

### Doing more of what works in many parts of the company has been great

In Go To Market, it's always tempting to explore new channels. However, in 2022, we really benefited from understanding where our growth was _actually_ coming from, and doing more of those things. This meant content marketing and word of mouth growth.

### Staying on top of i/c work as a cofounder with 40 people is hard

Tim and I have both felt this at different times. We think it's very important we both do individual work - simply, it's more fun to work _alongside_ someone, and that's only the case if we do some actual work. Longer term, we want a culture that values individual contribution, so we should do this ourselves.

However, it is tough pulling this off whilst making sure the entire company runs in a manner that we're proud of - we've both felt frustrated when we see our individual work slip as a result. That's no reason not to do it though.

## Things to watch

* looking after hobbyist users as our revenue is accelerating. Most users of PostHog pay us nothing, and they're often the ones talking about us as part of our word of mouth growth. This can conflict with short run revenue goals at times, but is fundamentally in line with long term targets (if we have a big fanbase, then that'll bring more fans both free _and_ paid) - and that's ultimately more important (since we're default alive)
* our margins! It'll be the first year we put real effort into hosting costs specifically. Alongside increasing our overall revenue figure, which will happen naturally with time, this is the other metric that'll make a series C easier to raise if we improve it (all the others we need are already in a great place).
* we build a real machine around certain things that are working - like content and customer success, so we can get more done and/or to a higher standard without more people.
* we've a PostHog 3000 project to pull off. It'll affect multiple teams, so managing to do that without a coordination mess happening will prevent us from being slow at shipping features.
* keeping on top of our infra/ingestion. We have a ridiculous number of events coming in, we must stay up and reliable. We've hired a lot here so far, but we've a huge surface area to manage.

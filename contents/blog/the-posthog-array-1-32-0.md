<b>IMPORTANT!</b> Do not upgrade to this version if you have deployed PostHog using Postgres. PostHog no longer supports Postgres as of <code>v1.31.0</code> (last version supported is <code>1.30.0</code>) and you must <a href="/docs/self-host/migrate-from-postgres-to-clickhouse" target="_blank">upgrade to ClickHouse</a> first.

## PostHog 1.32.0 release notes

> Don't see the new features on your self-hosted deployment? Remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog).

**Release highlights:**
- [Feature one](#feature-one)

### Redesigned Persons & Groups pages

We've redesigned how the Persons & Groups pages look to make it easier to find what you're looking for. You'll now be able to easily see which groups (if any) the user belongs to, and better manage the user's properties.

### Feature two

### Other improvements & fixes

- Set friendly names to your groups (from [Group Analytics](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics)). Now instead of seeing `org` (as you may call it in your code), you can rename it to see "Organization" in PostHog's UI. Further, you can now set the plurar version as well to improve readability. [PR](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/7974).
- Significant performance improvements to the Actions page. When viewing an action, we'll now show you the most recent events (~6 months ago) without constant polling. This should make it easy and faster to debug actions.
- Lifecycle query just got faster! We've also clarified how each of the groups (new, returning, resurrecting and dormant) in lifecycle are defined. [Read more](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/8021) on this.
- To improve query performance, the "All time" filter will now only consider events from 2015 onwards. We realized some instances had events with incorrect timestamps (frequently UNIX epoch [Jan 1, 1970]), which would lead to performance issues and hard to parse graphs.
- Plus 330+ improvements & fixes.

### Deprecation & removal notices

1. Since the previous version (1.31.0), we no longer supports a Postgres-only deployment of PostHog. Read [our migration guide](/docs/self-host/migrate-from-postgres-to-clickhouse) for instructions on moving over to a ClickHouse version. ClickHouse provides faster queries and is optimized for very large volumes of data, and you will also get a new lot of features.
2. We're removing support for insights with "Minute" intervals. From user feedback, these insights were hard to parse and could lead to significant performance issues in self-hosted instances. Please [reach out](/support) if you have any feedback on this. More details on the [PR](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/7847).

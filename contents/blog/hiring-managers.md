One thing PostHog I've found hard is hiring external managers into the company.

As we've grown, we've had some strong successes and failures. This is what we've learned. It is a little skewed towards engineering as we've not got many managers outside of that.

## Managers must be great individual contributors

We believe the most inspiring managers are exceptionally strong individual contributors (both from a skills and culture perspective) who are happy coaching those around them.

Some people may ask for career development or more management to make people happier, but we think instead of trying to make people happier by hiring professional managers that only focus on people topics, the root cause of most issues that we can control is the actual work itself being fun. An individual contributor manager, that loves building stuff or helping teams build stuff, is going to be a lot of fun to work with. Creating a culture of spectacular work, not one of a heavy HR vibe, feels ironically like the place that needs less HR in the first place. 

So, managers that can get entire teams to love focusing on the work, and taking pride in that, lead to the best outcomes for everyone.

We are, of course, biased - PostHog is small. We're around 42 people at the moment. We are split in small teams, each of which often owns an entire product. That means each small team has so few people, than every individual has a huge influence over each product's success. Therefore, instead of creating an arbitrary list of boxes to check as a career path, the way to progress is to get your product to be more successful. Larger businesses put in place checkboxes, which creates a culture of individuals acting in a self-interested way. We don't think that's right for us - hopefully it never will be.

## How we find people

The best source of leads for managers is those people already working within the company. There are a bunch of advantages:

* We know they get the details
* We'll have seen them collaborating with others already
* We know they're a culture fit
* This gives us another experience we can offer our team, to help avoid churn
* It's easier to teach a great individual contributor the basics of management (again, we're small - maybe it's easier for us) than the other way around
* This is a two way door - whereas if we hire an external manager in, it means if things go wrong, it's more likely we'll have to part ways

## The manager shouldn't fill too large a gap

Imagine the team without its manager, it needs to have the right group of people to get things prioritized and shipped fairly well.

Whilst the manager needs to have a lot of individual contributor skill, if the team cannot function without them, the team itself needs to be considered (since it's likely the manager will really struggle in this case). For example, maybe we should have two hires, we should create more clarity over the team's scope, move people around to increase the seniority of engineers in the team, or the scope itself should be reduced by changing ownership between multiple teams.

## How to hire a manager

If we are hiring someone internal, it'll be a matter of talking to the person and the team around them to get a sense of if we can change their role - from a skills and desire perspective.

If we are hiring externally - we should aim to hire lots of potential managers into individual contributor roles at first, and get them to work on challenging technical projects. In general, we aim to have lots of people like this all the time so it's easy to add more teams as we build more products. Often this is ex CTOs or technical founders who have lead teams but just love to code.

## Don't treat managers as superior

We do not pay people more money because they manage others (although, we _tend_ to have managers who are more experienced engineers and that may cause them to be getting paid more anyway). A very strong individual contributor may earn more than their manager - since management is quite narrowly scoped at PostHog, and they _may_ have more impact since there is a lot of autonomy. You could argue this is unfair - don't managers have _more_ responsibility so should get paid more?

They have _different_ responsibility. A manager could use their role to generate better performance, just as an individual could do the same through deep focus on an engineering breakthrough. Rather than choosing to pay managers more, we'd rather pay not be a significant motivating factor when someone moves into this type of role.

We've had some funny anecdotes because of this, that demonstrate organizational health. We've had team leads and team members tell us they want to swap roles before. But, my favorite - we were considering hiring a VP Engineering. One of the team leads, particularly keen on late nights coding, got wind of this and just straight up said "No, I'm too old for this shit".

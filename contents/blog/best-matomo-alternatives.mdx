### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an open-source platform combining web and product analytics, session replay, A/B testing, feature flags, user surveys and more into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to [Matomo](/blog/posthog-vs-matomo) but also tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly).

### Key features

- 📊 **Web analytics:** Monitor your web traffic by automatically capturing and calculating metrics like visitors, pageviews, session duration, and bounce rate. See the sources, entry and exit paths, channels, and more.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Matomo?

Both PostHog and Matomo are multi-product platforms. The big difference between them is that Matomo focuses on websites and content, while PostHog focuses on apps and products.

Another big difference is pricing. Matomo is only free to self-host. On top of this, features like session replays, heatmaps, and A/B testing are only available as paid add-ons in Matomo, but are free to use in PostHog.

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us üëã) is an open-source platform combining web and product analytics, session replay, A/B testing, feature flags, user surveys and more into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to [Matomo](/blog/posthog-vs-matomo) but also tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly).

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of October 2024, 5,330 of the top 1 million websites deploy PostHog. This is roughly a quarter of the 20,816 who use Matomo.

#### Key features

- üìä **Web analytics:** Monitor your [web traffic](/docs/web-analytics) by automatically capturing and calculating metrics like visitors, pageviews, session duration, and bounce rate. See the sources, entry and exit paths, [channels](/docs/data/channel-type), and more.

- üìà **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- üì∫ **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- üß™ **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- üí¨ **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Matomo?

Both PostHog and Matomo are multi-product platforms. The big difference between them is that Matomo focuses on websites and content, while PostHog focuses on apps and products.

Another big difference is pricing. Matomo is only free to self-host. On top of this, features like session replays, heatmaps, and A/B testing are only available as paid add-ons in Matomo, but are free to use in PostHog.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Matomo">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Free tier" description="Free forever option, no credit card required" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web analytics" description="Pre-built dashboard of aggregate traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="EU hosting" description="Store your data in the EU for compliance" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Matomo (web and product analytics), [Fullstory](/blog/posthog-vs-fullstory) (session replay), and [GrowthBook](/blog/posthog-vs-growthbook) (feature flags and A/B testing). This simplifies workflows and ensures product data is all in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever. Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> Because PostHog has a significant amount of overlap with Matomo and a generous free tier, it makes a great alternative. This is especially true for product and engineering focused teams.

## 3. Plausible

- **Founded:** 2019
- **Similar to:** Google Analytics, Matomo
- **Typical users:** Small SaaS companies
- **Typical customers:** Privacy-focused indiehackers and founders

![Plausible](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Clean_Shot_2024_10_03_at_10_03_23_2x_9ee8616ddf.png)

### What is Plausible?

### What is Umami?

Umami is an open source, easy-to-use Google Analytics alternatives. Like other similar tools, it is privacy friendly. This means data is anonymized, no personal data is saved, you don't need a cookie banner, and comply with GDPR. 

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Umami), as of October 2024, 1,077 of the top 1 million websites deploy Umami. Nearly 20x more (20,816) use Matomo.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Matomo replacement if:

- You want all the tools to help you build a better product (like product analytics and A/B testing).
- You value transparency. We're open source and open core.
- You want to try before you buy. We're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing).

Our primary goals for this release were to iron out bugs and improve the user experience of our Beta features.

As a result, we fixed **a whole lot of stuff**. We merged dozens of PRs with session recording fixes and improvements, and a dozen more with updates to our apps functionality. We also improved things like event ingestion, the UX for feature flags, and our settings for both organizations and projects. You can read through the entire list of fixes [later in this post](#bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements), but beware: it's quite long.

Finally, thank you to everyone who helped us out with feedback and contributions during this release cycle, you help us make PostHog better every day.

## Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience with nicer features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

### [New Event Selection Box](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/2394)

![Events Box Screenshot](../images/blog/array/events-box.png)

We upgraded our event selection box to include actions and events in one, as well as provide smarter recommendations of events and actions you might want to use of based frequently used in queries by you or your team.

### [Improvements to posthog-js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js)

A new version of `posthog-js` is available and we recommend you to update if you've installed it via `npm`. Snippet users have access to the latest version by default.

The new version includes a lot of bugfixes that improve our session recording feature, as well as is significantly lighter, having had [a lot of legacy code removed](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/128). 

R.I.P. to the hundreds of lines of JavaScript that were removed - you will not be missed.

### [Apps are now available on Kubernetes deployments](https://github.com/PostHog/charts/pull/24)

Following feedback from a user, we have now added support for [PostHog Apps](/docs/plugins/overview) to our Helm chart. 

If you're using the chart to deploy PostHog, upgrading to the latest version will give you access to the new app server (Beta).

### [Session Recording Improvements](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+session)

Out of the many improvements to session recording, there are some worth mentioning specifically:

- Keyboard shortcuts for the session recording player (`spacebar` to pause/play, `f` to open player in full screen)
- Ability to jump back/forward 8 seconds with the keyboard arrows (or player button)
- Full-screen support for the session recording player without losing the controls bar
- Pause/Play recording when clicking on the video
- Skipping inactivity made clearer with an overlay over the player
- The session recording player is now responsive to the client's screen size
- Incomplete session recordings (i.e. "blank screens") are now hidden from the list 

### [Honorary Mention: Requiring Curly Brackets](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/2505)

Our codebase now disallows bracket-less control structures, enforcing curly brackets on `if` statements for unbeatable readability. 

As described by Michael, one of our engineers:

_"They don't do anything, yet we thank them for their existence."_

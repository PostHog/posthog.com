## tl;dr

* We have cut our pricing by X for everyone using our product analytics - this is our biggest ever price decrease!
* We are now _by far_ the cheapest product analytics tool on the internet, with by far the broadest selection of features available of everyone, in our lowest pricing tier. We are 5-10x cheaper than the nearest competitor.
* We are going to continue making price cuts, this is the start.
* We have done this by creating a new lower tier for non-identified events - you can read the docs for how to set yourself up here.

## Pricing to value isn't the winning long term strategy

Pricing to value isn't in your customers' interests. Our mission is to help engineers build better products - if we charge based on how much we can get away with, instead of a lower "cost + X % margin" where X is fairly small, we are taking money out of their pockets. That means we're detracting from our mission. Charging huge margins creates opportunity for competition too.

We want to get engineers access to any tool that can help them. There are 30+ of these products in the world. Unfortunately, their incentives don't each align well with what is best for users.

## Why point soutions are expensive aka why does "every" piece of software become expensive and shitty

A typical lifecycle for a Venture Capital (VC) backed software company selling to other businesses looks like this depressing spiral:

* You solve a small problem in a business area like sales/marketing/engineering etc
  * You are better at solving a simple problem than a wide complex one with lots of functionality needed, since you are small
* You get some traction!
* You raise funding from Venture Capitalists!
* You increase your spending with the money
* You have to grow your revenue fast to keep raising to be able to make and expand payroll further
* To accelerate revenue, you add more and more go to market people into your company
* You start going upmarket, as you can get bigger order values. You charge more
* Eventually you have a handful of big customers that you have to please, and relatively few engineers compaered to salespeople, so shipping slows
* Worse, you may wind up making layoffs if you have poor unit economics from growing faster than you could cope with, and this demotivates your team and slows everything down even more since people quit
* The founder sells the company and moves on, the company stops innovating. Their soul is gone but they are rich.
* The product is now expensive and shitty

## How are we doing this differently 

* By having many products, people tend to buy several - so over time, we get high order values from each customer
* We don't do outbound sales. 1,200 companies _a week_ install our software, at minimal marketing/sales cost to us. This means we can save a ton of money, that we can use to focus on cutting prices and shipping more products. It also means we're doing business with people that want to work with us, which just saves us shipping features "to close a deal", that never closes. That saves more time and distraction.
* We won't copy but we don't ship products that don't have product market fit already. We're liberating lots of tools sold to non engineers, that we think should just be given directly to engineers to use - like analytics, session replay, etc.
* We don't rely on venture capital - we are running default alive / nearly profitably. This means we don't need to care about our revenue growth rate - we want fast growth, but it's more important we are able to be profitable at any time so our business is robust. Those relying on venture capital _must_ hit certain growth rates to keep raising, which forces them to up their prices.

## If you're the cheapest, won't your products be crappy?

Because of our greater efficiency, we can be better and cheaper:

* Better because you can integrate all the products together in one place (we are pretty deep with shockingly few people working in each team, processing 10s of billions of events each month)
* Cheaper because it is cheaper

## The more we give away, the more we make

Lower prices will drive higher retention and more sign ups. Being more generous means more people turn up and stick around. That is likely to outweigh a drop in the amount we get from each user.

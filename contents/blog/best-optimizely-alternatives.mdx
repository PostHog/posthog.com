![PostHog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1712355555/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/best-optimizely-alternatives/posthog-optimizely.png)

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us ðŸ‘‹) is an open-source platform that includes A/B testing, feature flags, product analytics, session replay, and user surveys. This means it's also an alternative to tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) (product analytics) and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (session replay and surveys).

Typical PostHog users are engineers and product managers at startups and mid-size companies. Customers include [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai), [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs), [Hasura](/customers/hasura), and Airbus.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of April 2024, 5,610 (0.5%) of the top 1 million websites use PostHog. This is slightly more than Optimizely's 5,353.

#### Key features

- **Feature flags:** Safely rollout features with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- **A/B tests:** Up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- **Product analytics:** Funnels, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Also supports [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

- **Session replays:** Including event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

### How does PostHog compare to Optimizely?

The core of feature flags and experimentation are similar between the two. The big difference is that PostHog is free, open-source, and has analytics built in, while Optimizely has a range of enterprise content, commerce, and collaboration tools.

</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace [Optimizely](/blog/posthog-vs-optimizely) (feature flags and A/B testing), [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) (analytics), and [Pendo](/blog/best-pendo-alternatives) (feedback and session replays). This simplifies workflows and ensures all your product data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever. Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> Being free, self-serve, and sharing many of the same features, PostHog is a great alternative to Optimizely. This is especially true for startups and scale-ups looking for product and data tools, though marketing teams may prefer Optimizely for experiments due to its visual editor.

## 3. LaunchDarkly

- **Founded:** 2014
- **Similar to:** PostHog, Kameleoon
- **Typical users:** Enterprise engineering teams
- **Typical customers:** Massive engineering-focused enterprises

### What is LaunchDarkly?

[LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) is a feature flag and A/B testing platform helping developers de-risk releases, target experiences, and optimize their product. It provides automation and governance features to ensure enterprises are following engineering best practices.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/LaunchDarkly), 1,019 of the top 1 million sites use LaunchDarkly. This is nearly 5x less than Optimizely's 5,353 but may undercount mobile and backend usage. Google Trends confirms that [Optimizely is better known](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=optimizely,launchdarkly,launch%20darkly) than LaunchDarkly, but not by a large margin.

#### Key features

- **Feature flags:** Control and target the release of features using multi-variate flags with real-time updates.

- **Experimentations:** Run A/B/n tests against metric groups and release winning variants.

- **Automation:** Automate and schedule progressive rollouts, trigger workflows.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Optimizely replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source)
- You focus more on improving your product than optimizing your content (we have a full suite of product analytics, session replays, and surveys).
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

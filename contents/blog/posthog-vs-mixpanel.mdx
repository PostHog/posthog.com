Want to know how PostHog and Mixpanel comapare? If you remember nothing else, remember these two points:

1. Mixpanel is a product analytics tool only.

2. PostHog is an all-in-one platform that _includes_ product analytics **and** a whole bunch more.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. It's more than product analytics

PostHog is the only product analytics platform built to natively work with session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys. This means you get all the tools you need to deploy new features, test their performance, observe and analyze how users interact with them, and gather feedback. Everything you need to truly understand user behavior, perfectly integrated.

### 2. It's built for engineers

We want engineers to engineer their products, not their data. PostHog autocaptures data, so you don't need to waste energy instrumenting basic events – we also offer robust tools for defining custom events. You can choose between light and dark mode themes and we cater to power users with a custom SQL query builder, keyboard shortcuts, and a command pallette. Our [customer success team]((/contact-sales)) is always available to answer your questions, but you setup PostHog and start paying us without ever speaking to a sales rep.

### 3. We're open source and transparent

PostHog is [built on transparency](/blog/how-to-run-a-transparent-company). Our product is open source and released under an MIT License. You can read [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), raise issues and PRs, and build your own integrations. Anyone can read or comment on our [public roadmap](/roadmap). Got a question? Ask it in our [community forum](/questions).

> #### Good to know
>
> - Qualatative insights from session replays and surveys are a great way to understand user paint points in a way raw data often can't, which is why we've baked them into our platform.
> 
> - Entering a credit card unlocks almost all our features and you **only pay for what you use**. You get a [generous free allowance](#pricing) _every_ month and you can set billing limits to prevent surprise bills.
>
> - All our products work via our JavaScript snippet, so one small piece of code unlocks a huge range of functionality with no addition integration work required.

### Product analytics

</ComparisonTable>

#### Good to know
>
> - **Autocapture** support means PostHog is much easier to implement than Mixpanel. You can signup and start ingesting events within minutes. Both tools support custom event tracking, but you need a comprehensive tracking plan before Mixpanel is useful. Read [Is autocapture 'still' bad?](/blog/is-autocapture-still-bad) for more on the benefits of autocapture.
>
> - [Correlation analysis](/docs/product-analytics/correlation) automatically suggests events and properties that correlate to success or failure – e.g. "users who converted were 10x more likely to use iOS".

> #### Good to know
>
> - **Local evaluation** enables you to massively reduce the number of API requests you make, improving performance and reducing costs at the same time. See our [local evaluation documentation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) for more information.

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="n/a" feature="Record via feature flag" description="Only record sessions for users that have the flag enabled" />
</ComparisonTable>

> #### Good to know
>
> - You get 5,000 recordings for free every month, so you'll pay nothing if you remain below this limit. You can use sampling and feature flags to limit the number of recordings you use. After 5,000 recordings, we charge $0.04 per recording and you'll pay less for each recording the more you use.
>
> - Session replays are _not_ video recordings of users. We reconstuct sessions by capturing Document Object Model (DOM) mutations. All private and personal data is masked.

> #### Good to know
> - Surveys are great for tracking customer satisfaction scores like Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer satisfaction (CSAT), and customer effort score (CES). We include survey templates for all these and more – read our [guide comparing NPS, CSAT and CES](/product-engineers/nps-vs-csat-vs-ces) to see which survey type you should use and when.

### How long does it take to deploy PostHog?

Deploying PostHog Cloud takes mere minutes. All you need to do is include a tracking snippet in your product or website and (thanks to autocapture) you're immediately capturing events. Once up and running, you can enable session recording via your project settings. 

See our guide to [getting started on PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud) for more info.

### How long does it take to deploy Mixpanel?

Integrating Mixpanel is simple enough – you can embed its snippet within `<head>` or install via package manager – but the lack of autocapture means you need to invest time and resources to instrument events manually before you can start creating insights.

### Does PostHog use cookies?

Yes, PostHog (like Mixpanel) uses cookies. Cookies are necessary to enable common use cases, such as cross-domain tracking and tracking returning visitors.

It is possible, however, to configure PostHog to track users without requiring [without cookie banners](/tutorials/cookieless-tracking) by storing cookies in `memory` so it doesn't persist beyond an individual session.

Both Mixpanel and PostHog also support anonymizing data, while the PostHog [Property Filter app](/apps/property-filter) allows you to limit the types of information collected to protect user privacy.

### How much does PostHog cost?

We believe in transparent pricing, which is why [our pricing page](/pricing) includes an easy-to-understand pricing calculator.

PostHog Cloud includes a generous 1 million events and 15,000 session replays per month for **free, every month** with **no feature limitations**.

A typical, medium-size B2B product with 10,000 monthly active users, who generate: 

- 100 events each per month
- 5 sessions each per month

Would use:

- 1 million events per month
- 50,000 session replays

Discounts for annual contracts are available on application.

### How much does Mixpanel cost?

Mixpanel prices based on "Monthly Track Users" (MTUs) and applies a limit of 1,000 events per MTU. A company with 10,000 MTUs would pay $190 per month, or £133 per month if you pay annually.

Mixpanel also offers a free tier with a 100k MTU limit, however it applies numerous feature limits – e.g. you can create but **not save** cohorts.

### How do PostHog and Mixpanel compare to Amplitude?

Amplitude is closer to Mixpanel than PostHog – it doesn't support features session replays or feature flagging, and doesn't offer autocapture. Read our [PostHog vs Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) comparison for information.

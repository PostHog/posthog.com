Want to know how PostHog and Mixpanel comapare? If you remember nothing else, remember these two points:

1. Mixpanel is a product analytics tool only.

2. PostHog is an all-in-one platform that _includes_ product analytics **and** a whole bunch more.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. It's more than product analytics

PostHog is the only product analytics platform built to natively work with session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys. This means you get all the tools you need to deploy new features, test their performance, observe and analyze how users interact with them, and gather feedback. Everything you need to truly understand user behavior, perfectly integrated.

### 2. It's built for engineers

We want engineers to engineer their products, not their data. PostHog autocaptures data, so you don't need to waste energy instrumenting basic events – we also offer robust tools for defining custom events. You can choose between light and dark mode themes and we cater to power users with a custom SQL query builder, keyboard shortcuts, and a command pallette. Our [customer success team](/contact-sales) is always available to answer your questions, but you can setup PostHog and start paying us without ever speaking to a sales rep.

### 3. We're open source and transparent

PostHog is [built on transparency](/blog/how-to-run-a-transparent-company). Our product is open source and released under an MIT License. You can read [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), raise issues and PRs, and build your own integrations. Anyone can read or comment on our [public roadmap](/roadmap). Got a question? Ask it in our [community forum](/questions).

## Comparison PostHog and Mixpanel

### Platform

Entering a credit card unlocks almost all our features and you **only pay for what you use**. You get a [generous free allowance](#pricing) _every_ month and you can set billing limits to prevent surprise bills.

</ComparisonTable>

### Product analytics

**Autocapture** support means PostHog is much easier to implement than Mixpanel. You can signup and start ingesting events within minutes. Both tools support custom event tracking, but you need a comprehensive tracking plan before Mixpanel is useful. Read [Is autocapture 'still' bad?](/blog/is-autocapture-still-bad) for more on the benefits of autocapture.

Anyone can use PostHog, but we built a SQL-based query builder specifically for power users, which enables them to generate custom data analyses using PostHog event data. In future, our query builder will work with non-event data sources, enabling you to analyze data as you would in a Business Intelligence tool, like Metabase – see our [HogQL docs](/docs/hogql) for more on this feature.

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Suggested events and properties that lead to success or failure" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Feature flags

Feature flags make it easy to roll out features to specific users or groups, and [safely test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production). Our feature flags are also tightly integrated with other tools, meaning you can target session replays, surveys and other features using existing feature flags. See [benefits of feature flags](/product-engineers/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) for more.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Mixpanel">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="n/a" feature="Boolean flags" description="Simple flags returning true or flag" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="n/a" feature="Multivariate flags" description="Flags with multiple customizable values" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="n/a" feature="Early access" description="Manage betas, test features" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Experimentation

PostHog's testing features are free when you enter card details. You get a generous 1 million API requests every month, so you'll pay nothing if you remain below this limit.

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="n/a" feature="Custom goals" description="Customize metrics that a test tracks" />

  <ComparisonRow column1="Bayesian" column2="n/a" feature="Statistics engine" description="How the results of an experiment are calculated" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Session replay

Replays enable you watch how users experience your app, diagnose issues, improve support, and understand real user behavior in a way raw data can't. You get 5,000 recordings for free every month, so you'll pay nothing if you remain below this limit, and you can use sampling and feature flags to limit the number of recordings you use.

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="n/a" feature="Record via feature flag" description="Only record sessions for users that have the flag enabled" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Surveys

- Surveys are great for tracking customer satisfaction scores like Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer satisfaction (CSAT), and customer effort score (CES). We include survey templates for all these and more – read our [guide comparing NPS, CSAT and CES](/product-engineers/nps-vs-csat-vs-ces) to see which survey type you should use and when.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can PostHog also replace Google Analytics?

Yes. PostHog can replace Google Analytics for many use cases – [our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing), for example. You can integrate PostHog into your website using Google Tag Manager. See our comparison of [PostHog and Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) and [An intro to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog) for more.

### Is PostHog easy to deploy?

Yes. Just paste our JS snippet within the `<head>` tags your product or website and you're good to go in just a few minutes. See our [installation documentation](/docs/getting-started/install) for more options. We support dozens of client-side and server-side SDKs.

### How much does PostHog cost?

You **only pay for what you use** and every PostHog users gets a generous amount of free usage each month:

|                       | **Free usage per month** 
|-----------------------|--------------------------
| **Product analytics** | 1 million events        
| **Session replay**    | 5,000 recordings         
| **Feature flags**     | 1 million API requests
| **A/B testing**       | 1 million API requests  
| **Surveys**           | 250 responses

You'll never pay anything if you stay within these limits and you can set billing limits to avoid surprise bills.

We charge progressively less the more you use – e.g. we charge $0.000100 per event up to 2 million events, but all events after 10 million a month only cost 
$0.000025, 75% less per event.

You can find a full breakdown on [our pricing page](/pricing).

### How can I estimate my usage?

The easiest way is to [sign up to PostHog](https://us.posthog.com/signup), integrate our snippet, then check the projection on your billing page after a few days. Alternatively, you can guesstimate by multiplying your current monthly active users by an estimate of events generated per user – 50 to 100 per user is a good starting point. See [Estimating usage & costs](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) in our docs for more.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default).

### Can I use PostHog with a CDP? (Segment, Rudderstack, etc.)

Yes. See [Using PostHog with a CDP](/docs/advanced/cdp) in our docs.

### What about ad blockers?

We recommend all users deploy a reverse proxy, which enables you send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain. Events sent from your own domain and are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers, ensuring you capure the best data possible. We have [reverse proxy setup guides](/docs/advanced/proxy) for AWS Cloudfront, Caddy, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, and more, in our docs.

### How do PostHog and Mixpanel compare to Amplitude?

Amplitude is closer to Mixpanel than PostHog – it doesn't support features session replays or surveys, and doesn't offer autocapture, but it does offer feature flaggs and A/B testing on some paid tiers. Read our [PostHog vs Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) comparison for information.

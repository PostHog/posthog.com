Want to know how PostHog and Mixpanel are different? If you remember nothing else, remember these two points:

1. Mixpanel is a product analytics tool.

2. PostHog is an all-in-one Product OS that _includes_ product analytics **and** a whole bunch more.

## How is PostHog different to Mixpanel?

### 1. PostHog does more than product analytics

Product analytics is a core part of our platform, but it's just one cog in a suite of vital tools for product and data teams. When you adopt PostHog you also get session recording (with console logs), feature flagging, A/B and multivariate testing, and customizable data pipelines – all seamlessly integrated.

### 2. It's built for engineers

Anyone can use PostHog – just [ask our marketing team](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) – but it's designed for engineers first. We believe engineering-led companies are the future of tech and that requires tools that let [engineers](https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer) flex their product muscles. 

### 3. We're an open book

PostHog is [built on transparency](/blog/how-to-run-a-transparent-company). Our product is open source and released under an MIT License. You can read [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog), raise your own issues and PRs, and [build apps atop PostHog](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server) to support custom data flows. Anyone can read or comment on our [public roadmap](/roadmap).

> This guide compares Mixpanel's self-serve Growth plan with PostHog Cloud. Features available on other plans are marked as such.

## Feature comparison

### Platform

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users use your product; diagnose bugs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Feature flags" description="Roll out features safely; toggle features for cohorts or individuals" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Enterprise" column2={true} feature="Experiments" description="Test changes and analyze their impact" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="User surveys" description="Ask users for qualitative feedback and gather responses" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Heatmaps" description="Track where users click and why" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Event pipelines" description="Push and pull data to enrich customer profiles" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Open source" description="Build your own apps and contribute code" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **Experiments:** Mixpanel offers an experiments feature in its Enterprise plan, but it's limited to running simple A/B tests. PostHog's experimentation suite supports A/B and multivariate tests using our integrated feature flagging. Visit our [experimentation product page](/product/experimentation-suite) for more info.

- **Feature flagging:** Mixpanel doesn't have any built-in feature flag functionality. PostHog Cloud includes unlimited flags for free. Visit [our feature flag page](/product/feature-flags) for more information.

- **Session replays:** PostHog offers 5,000 session replays (with console logs) per month for free. Visit our [session replays page](/product/session-recording) for more information.

### Product analytics

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Graphs and trends" description="Build custom insights and visualizations" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Combine insights into shareable dashboards" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Funnels" description="Understand conversion between events, pages" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cohorts" description="Combine users based on properties and events for group analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="User paths" description="Track user flows and where they drop-off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Retention" description="Analyze user and revenue retention" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="UTM tracking" description="Track marketing campaigns with UTM tags" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Suggested events and properties that lead to success or failure" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Understand how organizations use your product" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Formulas" description="Use custom formulas to calculate unique insights" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Query editor" description="Write your own queries in SQL" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **Correlation analysis:** When viewing a funnel in PostHog, [correlation analysis](/product/correlation-analysis) automatically suggests events and properties that correlate to success or failure. We use transparent, testable statistical models – no phony "AI" here.

- **Query editor:** Mixpanel doesn't support SQL queries, instead opting for its own query language, JQL (JavaScript Query Language). PostHog's SQL query editor is [currently in development](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/12352).

## Tracking & SDKs

PostHog and Mixpanel both support a broad range of tracking options and libraries, and manual event instrumentation. But PostHog also supports event autocapture, so you don't have to manually instrument all your events to track them,

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Event tracking" description="Track manually instrumented events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Automatically track events without instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Combined events" description="Track related events as a single trackable action or behavior" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Reverse proxy available" description="Send events from your own domain to capture more data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cross-domain tracking" description="Track users across domains and sub-domains" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Server-side tracking" description="Send events from your server" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Capture API" description="Send events through an API" />
</ComparisonTable>

> ### Why autocapture?
>
>Mixpanel, like Amplitude, forces you to manually instrument every event you want to track. That means you can only create queries based on events you've chosen to track in advance. Every time you think of something new to track, you then need to wait for the data. 
>
>Autocapture eliminates this tedious process. Just deploy our snippet and we'll do the hard work. In doing so, you're creating a powerful dataset you can call upon whenever you need it. Autocapture is ideal for fast moving teams who want to ship code product improvements quickly. 
>
> Some would have you believe that autocapture generates "too much data" that's hard to deal with. Our answer?

> To quote Tony Stark: “An intelligence agency which fears intelligence is, historically, not awesome.”

### Client libraries

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="JavaScript" description="Recommended for full PostHog functionality" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="React Native" description="Session recording not available" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Flutter" description="Event tracking and user identification only" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="iOS (Swift)" description="Autocapture and session replays not available" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="iOS (Objective-C)" description="Autocapture and session replays not available" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Android" description="Event tracking and user identification only" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Unity" description="" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **JavaScript snippet:** All client libraries support event tracking and user identification for product analytics, but we recommend using PostHog's JavaScript snippet to enjoy all our features. See our [client library documentation](/docs/getting-started/install?tab=snippet) for more information.

- **Mobile app session replays:** We don't currently support session recording in mobile apps, but it's currently under consideration as a project for our team. See our [public roadmap](/roadmap) for more info.

- **Unity:** We don't have a Unity SDK yet but, as we're open-source, anyone can create one. See our [contribution guidelines](/docs/contribute) for more info.

### Server libraries

Some PostHog features, such as session replays and autocapture, are only available via our client-side libraries.

## Integrations

Mixpanel claims over 50 official integrations covering a wide-range of use cases. Given its focus on product analytics alone, many of these integrations connect to third-party tools for A/B testing, feature flag, and marketing use cases.

The [PostHog App Store](/apps) has over 50 apps as well, though not all of these are integrations with external tools. Some are apps that modify data flows or add components to your frontend. PostHog doesn't natively connect with A/B testing or feature flag tools as these features are built into PostHog itself.

- [Data Export](#data-export) 
- [Data Import](#data-import)
- [Dev Tools & Support](#dev-tools--support)

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Census" description="Reverse ETL data to multiple platforms" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Dev tools & support

As an open source platform designed for technical teams, PostHog integrates with numerous developer tools and platforms. This isn't an area of strong support for Mixpanel.

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="BitBucket Release Tracker" description="Track impact of releases in analytics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="GitHub Release Tracker" description="Track impact of releases in analytics" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Zendesk" description="Track tickets as events, add context to tickets" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Marketing & sales

Both platforms integrate with a wide-range of sales and marketing tools to support automation flows and user data synchronization. 

Mixpanel has a specific advantage in connecting to Google and Facebook's advertising platforms directly, enabling in-product tracking of campaign ROI. 

It's easy to track marketing conversions in PostHog, but you can't currently connect that directly to campaign spending data.

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Customer.io" description="Sync data and trigger workflows in Customer.io" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Hubspot" description="Sync customer data to and from Hubspot" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Engage" description="Automate onboarding and retention messaging" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Salesforce" description="Sync customer data to and from Salesforce" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Sendgrid" description="Automate email workflows" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Twitter" description="Track Twitter follower growth" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Variance" description="Define PQLs with real analytics data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Facebook Ads" description="Track Facebook ad ROI" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Mailchimp" description="Automate marketing emails" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Intercom" description="Automate your product comms" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Alerts & automation

Mixpanel and PostHog both support popular messaging apps and automation platforms, though PostHog also supports Discord and the open-source Zapier alternative, n8n.

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Slack" description="Send alerts and reports to Slack" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Discord" description="Send alerts and reports to Discord" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Microsoft Teams" description="Send alerts and reports to Teams" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="n8n" description="Open source workflow automation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Twilio" description="Automate SMS alerts on events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Zapier" description="Automate workflows on events" />
</ComparisonTable>

## Privacy, admin & security

### Privacy compliance

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="GDPR compliant" description="EU hosting or data residency available" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="Self-host only" feature="HIPAA compliant" description="Business Associate Agreement available" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Data anonymization" description="Remove personally identifiable information" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Self-hosting option" description="Self-host and keep complete control of your data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Cookieless tracking option" description="Use analytics without cookie consent banners" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **Self-hosting:** While we recommend most customers use PostHog Cloud, PostHog can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure so you keep control of all your data. This is useful for businesses that handle highly sensitive information, such as defense or health data, but it is more expensive than using PostHog Cloud. See: [Who should self-host PostHog?](#who-should-selfhost-posthog)

- **HIPAA compliance:** Mixpanel will sign a Business Associate Agreement if you require HIPAA compliance. At PostHog, we recommend self-hosting PostHog if you require [HIPAA compliance](/docs/privacy/hipaa-compliance). This ensures all sensitive data never leaves your infrastructure, giving you complete control and simplifying compliance processes.

- **Cookie-less tracking:** If you'd rather not serve annoying cookie banners to your users, PostHog can be configured to store data in memory so it doesn't persist beyond a single session. See: [How to use PostHog without cookie banners](/tutorials/cookieless-tracking). Note: some types of user analysis aren't possible with this method.

### Admin & security

<ComparisonTable column1="Mixpanel" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="SOC 2 certification" description="Externally audited security" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Enterprise" column2="Enterprise" feature="SAML/SSO" description="Organization single sign-on" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Access levels" description="Assign access levels to team members" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Multiple organizations" description="Create orgs for all your internal teams" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Multiple projects" description="Track multiple products and domains" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2="Enterprise" feature="Private projects" description="Create hidden projects with user permissions" />
</ComparisonTable>

- **PostHog Enterprise:** Our [Enterprise tier](/enterprise) includes single sign-on, private projects, and a dedicated Slack support channel.

## Frequently asked questions

- [How long does it take to deploy PostHog?](#how-long-does-it-take-to-deploy-posthog)
- [How long does it take to deploy Mixpanel](#how-long-does-it-take-to-deploy-mixpanel)
- [Does PostHog user cookies?](#does-posthog-use-cookies)
- [How much does PostHog cost?](#how-much-does-posthog-cost)
- [How much does Mixpanel cost?](#how-much-does-mixpanel-cost)
- [How do PostHog and Mixpanel compare to Amplitude?](#how-do-posthog-and-mixpanel-compare-to-amplitude)

### How long does it take to deploy PostHog?

Deploying PostHog Cloud takes mere minutes. All you need to do is include a tracking snippet in your product or website and (thanks to autocapture) you're immediately capturing events. Once up and running, you can enable session recording via your project settings. 

See our guide to [getting started on PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud) for more info.

### How long does it take to deploy Mixpanel?

Integrating Mixpanel is simple enough – you can embed its snippet within `<head>` or install via package manager – but the lack of autocapture means you need to invest time and resources to instrument events manually before you can start creating insights.

### Does PostHog use cookies?

Yes, PostHog (like Mixpanel) uses cookies. Cookies are necessary to enable common use cases, such as cross-domain tracking and tracking returning visitors.

It is possible, however, to configure PostHog to track users without requiring [without cookie banners](/tutorials/cookieless-tracking) by storing cookies in `memory` so it doesn't persist beyond an individual session.

Both Mixpanel and PostHog also support anonymizing data, while the PostHog [Property Filter app](/apps/property-filter) allows you to limit the types of information collected to protect user privacy.

### How much does PostHog cost?

We believe in transparent pricing, which is why [our pricing page](/pricing) includes an easy-to-understand pricing calculator.

PostHog Cloud includes a generous 1 million events and 5,000 session replays per month for **free, every month** with **no feature limitations**.

A typical, medium-size B2B product with 10,000 monthly active users, who generate: 

- 100 events each per month
- 5 sessions each per month

Would use:

- 1 million events per month
- 50,000 session replays

Discounts for annual contracts are available on application.

### How much does Mixpanel cost?

Mixpanel prices based on "Monthly Track Users" (MTUs) and applies a limit of 1,000 events per MTU. A company with 10,000 MTUs would pay $190 per month, or £133 per month if you pay annually.

Mixpanel also offers a free tier with a 100k MTU limit, however it applies numerous feature limits – e.g. you can create but **not save** cohorts.

### How do PostHog and Mixpanel compare to Amplitude?

Amplitude is closer to Mixpanel than PostHog – it doesn't support features session replays or feature flagging, and doesn't offer autocapture. Read our [PostHog vs Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) comparison for information.

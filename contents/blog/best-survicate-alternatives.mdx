3. **It has pre-built reports and templates:** Users like the comprehensive documentation and the fact there are numerous templates they can immediately apply and adapt to their needs.

But, while Survicate goes slightly deeper on survey features, PostHog integrates entire tools Survicate doesn't, such as [session replays](/session-replay), [product analytics](/product-analytics), and [A/B testing](/experiments). This makes it easier to connect survey data to real users, and real sessions.

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It's many tools in one:** PostHog can replace Survicate (surveys), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (analytics), and [Statsig](/blog/posthog-vs-statsig) (A/B testing and feature flags). This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and build better products.

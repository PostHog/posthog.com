### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an open-source, all-in-one platform for feature management, A/B testing, product analytics, session replay, and user surveys. It's also building a [data warehouse for startups](/docs/data-warehouse) and a customer data platform (CDP), though both are currently in closed beta.

By combining all these tools into one platform, it eliminates the need for stitching together integrations between third-party tools, and makes it easier for engineers to work with data. PostHog is popular with engineering-led companies, like AI startup [ElevanLabs](/customers/elevenlabs) and [carVertical](/feature-flags), which use PostHog for both feature flags and analytics.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), PostHog's used by 4,661 (0.47%) of the top 1 million websites, compared to Statsig's 706 (0.07%). This difference is [confirmed by Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=posthog,statsig), which indicates PostHog is considerably more popular.

#### Key features

- ðŸ§ª **A/B tests:** Experiment in your app with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Auto-calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- ðŸš© **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- ðŸ“º **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- ðŸ’¬ **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies pick PostHog because:

1. **It's many tools in one:** PostHog can replace Split (feature flags and A/B testing), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (analytics), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate PostHog's affordability and that pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to build better products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> PostHog makes for a great alternative to Split as it includes all the key feature flag and experimentation features along with being free, self-serve, and open source. For product-led startups and scaleups, it is an especially good choice as its got a full suite of tools built for them.

## 1. PostHog

- **Founded:** 2020
- **Similar to:** Statsig, Amplitude
- **Typical users:** Engineers and product teams

![PostHog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/feature-flags.png)

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an open-source, all-in-one platform for feature management, A/B testing, product analytics, session replay, and user surveys. It's also building a [data warehouse for startups](/docs/data-warehouse) and a customer data platform (CDP), though both are currently in closed beta.

By combining all these tools into one platform, it eliminates the need for stitching together integrations between third-party tools, and makes it easier for engineers to work with data. PostHog is popular with engineering-led companies, like AI startup [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs) and [carVertical](/customers/carvertical), which use PostHog for both feature flags and analytics.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), PostHog is used by 4,661 (0.47%) of the top 1 million websites, compared to Statsig's 706 (0.07%). This difference is [confirmed by Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=posthog,statsig) data.

#### Key features

- üß™ **A/B tests:** Experiment in your app with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Auto-calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- üö© **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- üìà **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- üì∫ **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- üí¨ **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Statsig?

Statsig and PostHog are similar in some ways, but have different strengths. 

PostHog offers more powerful product analytics and session replay features, including support for [event autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), writing [custom SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql), and [session replay on Android apps](/docs/session-replay/mobile). It also supports a handful of feature flag features not available with Statsig, and offers user surveys.

Statsig, as its name suggests, is an A/B testing tool first and foremost. While both tools support core testing features, like secondary metrics and multivariate tests, PostHog doesn't offer multi-armed bandit, or mutually exclusive experiments.

</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It's many tools in one:** PostHog can replace Statsig (feature flags and A/B testing), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (analytics), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and build better products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

3. **It's easy to get started:** Many users love how PostHog's event autocapture means they can go from implementing its tracking code to ingesting events in just a few minutes. Enabling session replay is equally straightforward, so you can instantly start seeing how people are navigating your app or website.

> #### Bottom line
> 
> PostHog is an ideal Statsig alternative if you're looking for a more powerful analytics tool that can also serve your A/B testing and feature management needs. It also offers a dedicated EU-hosted cloud at no extra cost.

## 3. Amplitude

- **Founded:** 2012
- **Most similar to:** PostHog, Statsig
- **Typical users:** Product managers, data analysts, marketing teams

![amplitude](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/amplitude-website.png)

### What is Amplitude?

[Amplitude](/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives) was one of the original product analytics tools. Many large enterprise customers, like Ford, NBCUniversal, and Walmart rely on it. In recent years, it‚Äôs also added A/B testing, feature flags, session replays, and a customer data platform, making it an obvious alternative to Statsig.

Unsurprisingly, given it was founded in 2012, it's much more widely used. According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Amplitude), as of April 2024, 9,760 of the top million sites use Amplitude, compared to Statsig's 706.

### Why do companies use Kameleoon?

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/kameleoon/reviews), users are big fans of the following aspects of Kameleoon:

1. **Statistical tools:** Reviewers are more confident about the results of their experiments thanks to Kameleoon's different statistical engines and AI copilot.

2. **Editors:** The combination of the graphics and widget editors makes it easy to set up A/B tests and personalizations.

3. **Integrations:** Reviewers like how Kameleoon integrates with all the tools they already use, like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, and Mixpanel.

> #### Bottom line
> For companies looking for a developer-focused optimization platform, Kameleoon is a good alternative. Though it not being self-serve is a major downside.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Statsig replacement if:

- You value transparency. We're open source and open core.
- You want more than just A/B testing and feature flags. We have a full suite of product analytics, session replays, and surveys.
- You want to try before you buy. We're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing).

Check out [our product pages](/feature-flags) and [read our docs](/docs) to learn more.

*Hi, my name is Bob, and I'm 10 days sober from GA4.*

Welcome. Grab a chair.

This is a [safe space for developers who set up web analytics](newsletter/misconceptions-about-analytics), still don't trust the numbers, and have rage-closed at least one dashboard this year.

If you’re anything like Bob, you’re not alone. Most web analytics tools were built for marketers, not developers — and finding one that actually fits a modern dev workflow isn’t always straightforward.

![Uno GA4](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Screenshot_2026_01_13_at_5_08_32_PM_e9584ccfa3.png)

In this guide, we compare the best web analytics tools for developers, so you can understand users, debug faster, and actually trust your data.

## What features do you need in a web analytics tool?

At a minimum, a web analytics tool should tell you what's happening on your site:

- Pageviews, sessions, and unique visitors
- Traffic sources and referrers
- UTM and campaign tracking
- Conversion or goal tracking
- Real-time or near real-time reporting

The best web analytics tools go further by giving you:

- **Event-based tracking**, so you can track meaningful actions
- **Funnels, paths, and retention**, to understand how users move through your site and where they drop off.
- **Session replay and heatmaps**, to see what users actually did
- **Error tracking and performance context**, so you can connect broken experiences to user impact
- **Raw data access** via SQL or APIs/exports for programmatic data retrieval and custom integrations
- **Privacy-first design** so you can skip cookie banners and stay GDPR/CCPA compliant
- **Transparent pricing** so a traffic spike doesn't lead to a finance incident.

Here's how some of the most popular web analytics tools compare:

## What's the best web analytics tool for developers?

### 1. PostHog

PostHog is an all-in-one developer platform that combines [web analytics](/web-analytics) with [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [experiments](/experiments), [error tracking](/error-tracking), and [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics) in one place.

Unlike standalone web analytics tools, PostHog lets you follow a visitor's journey from their first pageview through to product usage; you still get the fundamentals, but they're directly connected to how users actually behave in your product. 

Every pageview can be tied to events, users, recordings, flag variants, errors, and more. You can see which channels bring high-value users, [combine analytics and replays to understand drop-offs](how-to-find-and-fix-onboarding-drop-off), and run experiments to optimize conversion – all without switching tools.

PostHog also uses simple [usage-based pricing](/pricing) with a generous free tier that includes 1 million events per month, which is enough for most early-stage teams to get real value before paying anything.

### 2. Plausible

[Plausible](/blog/posthog-vs-plausible) is a lightweight, privacy-first analytics tool that positions itself as an ethical alternative to Google Analytics. Adding Plausible to your stack is painless: setup takes minutes, the script is tiny, and the UI is refreshingly easy to understand. It doesn't require cookies and is fully GDPR compliant out of the box.

The dashboard is intentionally simple: a single page with the essential metrics. You get traffic, sources, pages, locations, and devices – nothing more, nothing less. Plausible deliberately trades analytical depth for simplicity and strong privacy guarantees.

Because [Plausible](/blog/best-plausible-alternatives) avoids deep user tracking by design, there's no session replay, no detailed funnels, no user-level timelines, and no product analytics.

Plans start at $9/month for a single site with 3 years of data retention, and scale to $14/month and $19/month as you add more sites, team members, and features like funnels, custom properties, revenue attribution, and API access. An Enterprise plan is available for larger setups, with SSO, higher API limits, raw data exports, and priority support.

**Strengths:**

- Extremely lightweight (~1KB script)
- No cookies, fully GDPR/CCPA compliant
- Excellent reliability, with 99.99% uptime over the last 30 days
- Open source and self-hostable
- Google Search Console integration

**Community:**

- Open source under the AGPL license at https://github.com/plausible/analytics
- 24k+ stars on GitHub with active community contributions

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="Plausible is best for" type="fyi">

Privacy-conscious developers who want simple, essential website metrics without the bloat, heavy instrumentation, or privacy concerns of traditional analytics tools.

</CalloutBox>

### 3. Fathom

Speaking of privacy, [Fathom](/blog/posthog-vs-fathom) is a minimalist, privacy-focused web analytics tool built for teams that want to minimize overhead. Like Plausible, it's designed to be easy to install, easy to understand, and respectful of user privacy by default.

The script is lightweight (~2KB), works without cookies, and offers permanent data retention so you never lose historical analytics. There's no invasive tracking and no need for cookie banners.

[Fathom](/blog/best-fathom-alternatives) integrates cleanly with almost any stack; their script can be added to virtually any CMS, framework, or site setup (from WordPress and Webflow to modern frameworks like Next.js and Vue). There's no complex setup, no special build steps, and no lock-in to a specific platform.

Pricing is straightforward and traffic-based. Plans start at $15/month for up to 100,000 pageviews and scale predictably as traffic grows, reaching $200/month for up to 10 million pageviews. Annual billing offers a 17% discount (roughly two months free), with higher tiers available for very high-traffic sites.

**Strengths:**

- Extremely simple setup with a lightweight (~2 KB) script
- Clean integrations across common tools and platforms
- Forever data retention included
- Easy-to-use, powerful API 
- Built-in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR

**Community:**

- Fathom Lite is open source at https://github.com/usefathom/fathom
- The main product is closed-source but actively developed
- Strong community of privacy advocates

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="Fathom is best for" type="fyi">

Developers who want privacy-friendly website analytics that integrate effortlessly with their existing stack and provide clean, reliable metrics without complexity.

</CalloutBox>

### 4. Matomo

[Matomo](/blog/posthog-vs-matomo) is one of the most established [open-source web analytics platforms](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools), used by over one million websites, including government agencies, universities, and large enterprises.

Matomo's interface will ring a bell to anyone who's used Universal Analytics [(which many still prefer over GA4 – RIP)](/blog/ga4-alternatives). It offers a comparable feature set, but with full data ownership.

Matomo is built for teams that want depth and flexibility, not minimalism. With great power comes great complexity. Setup, configuration, and ongoing maintenance can take more time, especially if you're self-hosting or enabling multiple plugins.

The on-premise version is free and gives you complete control over your data. The cloud version includes premium features like heatmaps, session recordings, and A/B testing as paid add-ons; it starts at €22/month (excl. tax) for up to 50,000 hits, with discounts for annual billing.

**Strengths:**

- Complete data ownership with self-hosting
- GDPR compliant with configurable privacy settings
- Google Analytics data import
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Broad feature set, including funnels, heatmaps, session recording, and ecommerce analytics

**Community:**

- Open source under GPL v3 at https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo
- 21k+ stars with 400+ contributors
- One of the oldest and most established open-source analytics projects

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="Matomo is best for" type="fyi">

Developers that need full-featured, self-hosted analytics with complete data ownership – and are comfortable managing the added complexity.

</CalloutBox>

### 5. Mixpanel

[Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) is primarily a product analytics platform, but it now includes dedicated web analytics features that make it worth considering for certain use cases.

Unlike traditional web analytics tools that focus on pageviews and traffic, Mixpanel is built around events and users. You track actions like sign-ups, button clicks, feature usage, and conversions, then analyze them using funnels, retention, cohorts, and breakdowns.

This makes Mixpanel powerful for understanding how users interact with a web app after they arrive; it shines when your "website" behaves more like a product than a marketing site. The tradeoff is that it's less useful for content-heavy sites or teams focused on traffic sources, SEO performance, or page-level reporting.

Mixpanel offers a free plan that includes 1 million events per month, with paid plans scaling based on event volume as usage grows.

**Strengths:**

- Powerful funnels, retention, and cohort analysis
- Real-time querying and fast dashboards
- Strong support for product-led growth use cases
- Mature ecosystem and integrations

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="Mixpanel is best for" type="fyi">

Product-led web applications where understanding user actions, activation, and retention matters more than traditional traffic metrics like pageviews and referrers.

</CalloutBox>

### 6. Cloudflare Web Analytics

Cloudflare Web Analytics is a free, privacy-first analytics tool from Cloudflare. 

You can deploy it either via a JavaScript snippet (like other analytics tools) or directly from Cloudflare's edge if your site already uses their CDN – no client-side code required.

Cloudflare Web Analytics is intentionally basic: no funnels, no custom events, no user-level tracking, no session replay. Data retention is limited, and high-traffic sites may experience sampling.

It's best thought of as a lightweight complement to other tools rather than a full analytics solution.

If you're already using Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, or security, adding Web Analytics takes about 30 seconds. For everyone else, it's still a quick JavaScript snippet away.

**Strengths:**

- Completely free with no traffic limits
- No cookies, fully privacy-compliant
- Edge-based tracking option (no JavaScript required for Cloudflare users)
- Lightweight and fast
- Simple, clean dashboard

**Community:**

- Closed-source commercial product (part of Cloudflare's free tier)
- Active development as part of Cloudflare's broader analytics suite

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="Cloudflare Web Analytics is best for" type="fyi">

Developers already using Cloudflare who want free, privacy-first website metrics with zero setup – or anyone who needs a simple, no-cost baseline for traffic monitoring.

</CalloutBox>

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What is web analytics, really?</summary>

Web analytics is the art and science of understanding how people find your site, what they do on it, and what happens next. At its simplest, that means tracking pageviews and referrers. At its most useful, it means understanding behavior, friction, and outcomes.

Good web analytics answers questions like: Why did users bounce? Where did they drop off? What landing page worked?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What metrics matter most in web analytics?</summary>

Most teams should start with: traffic sources (where users come from), landing pages (where sessions start), bounce rate or engagement (whether users do anything meaningful), and conversions (sign-ups, purchases, or key actions).

As your site becomes more product-like, event-based metrics (clicks, actions, feature usage) become more important than raw pageviews.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are pageviews still useful?</summary>

Yes, but they're rarely sufficient.

Pageviews are good for understanding reach and interest, especially for content sites. They're much less useful for explaining why users behaved a certain way or whether something broke.

That's why many modern tools pair pageviews with events, funnels, or session replay.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between cookieless and cookie-based analytics?</summary>

Cookie-based analytics track users across sessions using identifiers stored in the browser. Cookieless analytics avoid this and rely on aggregated or anonymous signals instead.

[Cookieless tools are easier to make privacy-compliant and less invasive for users](/blog/best-gdpr-compliant-analytics-tools). The tradeoff is less granular user-level tracking. For many sites, that's a feature, not a bug.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is web analytics affected by ad blockers?</summary>

Yes, especially tools that rely entirely on client-side JavaScript. Privacy-first tools, server-side collection, or edge-based analytics (like Cloudflare's) tend to be more resilient, but no analytics setup is 100% immune. This is another reason to focus on trends and patterns, not exact counts.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to display a cookie consent banner?</summary>

It depends on the tool and your jurisdiction. **Plausible**, **Fathom**, and **Cloudflare Web Analytics** don't use cookies and generally don't require consent banners. **Google Analytics 4** uses cookies by default and typically requires consent in the EU. **Matomo** and **PostHog** can be configured to run cookieless, but you'll need to verify your setup meets local requirements.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between web analytics and product analytics?</summary>

Web analytics focuses on traffic and pages (who visited, where they came from, what they viewed). [Product analytics](/blog/what-is-product-analytics) focuses on behavior and users (what actions users took, how they activate, retain, or churn).

Tools like **PostHog** combine both, so you can see how traffic turns into real [product usage](/product-analytics).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What should I look for in analytics pricing?</summary>

Watch for how tools measure usage. Some charge by pageviews, others by events, others by monthly tracked users. A site with 100k pageviews and 10k users will cost very different amounts depending on the model. Also check what's included: some tools charge extra for features like funnels, session replay, or data exports.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much data retention do I actually need?</summary>

6–12 months is enough for short-term optimization. 2–3 years is useful for trend analysis and seasonality. Forever retention sounds nice, but it only matters if you actually revisit historical data. Many teams don't.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need session replay with web analytics?</summary>

Not always — but it's extremely useful when debugging issues or understanding drop-offs. Tools like PostHog link analytics directly to [session replay](/blog/best-session-replay-tools), so you can see exactly what users did instead of guessing from charts.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I self-host my web analytics?</summary>

Yes. Matomo, for example, offers a fully self-hosted option with complete data ownership. Some teams choose this for compliance, residency, or regulatory reasons, with the tradeoff of higher operational complexity.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Which web analytics tool is best for content sites or blogs?</summary>

For blogs, documentation, and marketing sites: **Plausible** and **Fathom** are ideal for clean dashboards and privacy-friendly metrics. **Cloudflare Web Analytics** works well for high-level traffic visibility with zero setup.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Which web analytics tool is best for product-led web apps?</summary>

If your website behaves like a product: **[PostHog](/web-analytics)** is best if you want analytics plus [replay](/session-replay), [flags](/feature-flags), [experiments](/experiments), and debugging. **Mixpanel** is a good choice if you care primarily about events, funnels, and retention — not pageviews.

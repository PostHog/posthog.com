## Does the company have product market fit?

"Do you ever question if you have product market fit?"
"When did you reach product market fit? How did you know?"
"What do you need to do to get to product market fit?"
"What's your revenue? What was it a year ago?"
"How many daily active users do you have?"

It's ok if these answers show you the founder doesn't have product market fit. In this case, figure out if they will get to a yes.

Early stage founders are desperately keen to have product market fit - it's all that really matters. The ones that will succeed are those that are honest about this (or those that have it already) and are prioritizing it top. I'd be very wary of low user/revenue numbers, or vague answers above, and a claim to have product market fit - good traction will usually follow almost immediately.

Avoid:

* founders who don't talk and sell to users pre product market fit
* companies where you don't understand the product or its benefits (if it can't be explained to you, others will struggle)
* solutions looking for a problem

If there is no product market fit, but you think the team could find it, it's very important the company has lots of runway (it'll be hard to raise more money without product market fit, so time to find it is crucial) and that the startup doesn't have a huge team (it's harder to make rapid changes in direction with a lot of people).

## How much runway does the company have? Does their spending look within reason?

"What's your monthly burn?"

This is how much money the company is losing each month. For example, if you had $50K in revenue but spent $100K on salaries, marketing and everything else, your burn would be $50K"

"What's your runway?"

If a company doesn't have product market fit, spending should be minimal.

If a company has strong product market fit _and_ has a ton of traction, a shorter runway is ok.

"Are you default alive"

This is best case scenario. The company whilst not profitable, is growing . There are exceptions, if I grew from $1 in revenue to $10 in revenue, extrapolating this will look pretty decent but 


## What's the culture like?

"What are the company values, and why?"
"Who decides what to build?"
"What do you look for when you hire?"

## How strong is the team?

"Tell me about the team I'd be working with most closely"
"How do you compensate the team?"

You are trying to understand if they view engineering as a cost center or not. Great answers to optimize for your learning (and I'd argue long term company success) are opinionated around fewer, stronger people versus throwing as many people at each problem as possible.

## What's in store in the future?

"Do you plan to sell the company?"
"Do you believe in secondaries? Would you offer these to your team, if possible?"

## What's the strategy?

## Do the founders get on?

"How do you handle disagreement between founders?"

One of the most common ways for an early stage company to die is that the founders break up.

## Miscellaneous

"What keeps you up at night?"

## Do I want to work here?

"How long does setting up the dev environment take?"

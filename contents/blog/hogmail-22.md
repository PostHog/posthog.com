I have good news and bad news. The bad news... this is the last ever HogMail. 😢

The good news? We're launching a brand new newsletter that's very similar HogMail, but [more muscular](https://twitter.com/posthog/status/1628432250575458309)?! 💪

They'll be no gap in service, but your next newsletter will look a little different.

## Why do companies over-hire?

Josephine Conneely [makes a strong case](https://waysofworkingcollection.substack.com/p/why-do-companies-over-hire) for the power of small teams. Some takeaways:

- If hiring to drive growth ask yourself: "what would the leanest version of hiring look like? It may be possible to achieve most of your growth goals with a smaller team."
 
- Low performance and/or blame cultures encourage over-hiring. It "reduces what any one individual can be accountable for" and "ensures there are enough scapegoats in place to deflect blame to".
 
- "Too many generalists can lead companies to over-hiring as they lack the expertise to execute effectively. Too many specialists can lead to over-hiring as roles are broken down into niche subsets."

## How you work together > how you socialize

Here's a [great read on async working](https://async.twist.com/remote-team-culture/) by Chase Warrington, Head of Remote at chat app Twist. It can be summed up by this graphic:

The post includes three useful tips for fostering the social bonds in an async team:

1. Make attendance truly optional
2. Treat social activities as part of the workday, not extracurricular
3. Remember what truly unites us: our work.

## Tips for challenging the status quo

Dissent fuels innovation, but a "challenge everything" culture can "quickly metastasize into a culture of assholes," [says Hebba Youseff](https://workweek.com/2022/11/28/challenging-the-status-quo-at-work/). How do you find the balance? When challenging ideas, consider:

- "What is your internal dialogue telling you about how you are showing up in this discussion? Are there outside factors that could be impacting you?" (e.g. your emotional state / personal feelings)
 
- "Do you have all the context? You should understand the situation fully before suggesting a different solution."
 
- "Do not speak for others or assume their motivations. It can be easy to project on others but that can be insulting for anyone else in the room."

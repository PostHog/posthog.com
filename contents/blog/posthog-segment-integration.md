Today, we're announcing that PostHog is available as a destination on Segment.
Segment allows you to integrate event tracking in your app once, and then send those events to a wide variety of sources.

PostHog is the only product analytics platform that's completely open source and gives you full control over your data.

To get started, see the [Segment - PostHog integration docs](/docs/integrations/segment-integration)

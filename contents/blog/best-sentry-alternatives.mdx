-   📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

-   🚩 **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

-   🧪 **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

-   💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Sentry replacement if:

-   You value transparency. We're open source and open core.
-   You want all the tools to help you build a better product (like product analytics, session replays, and A/B testing).
-   You want to try before you buy. We're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing).

Check out [error tracking install guide](/docs/error-tracking/installation) and [read our docs](/docs) to learn more.

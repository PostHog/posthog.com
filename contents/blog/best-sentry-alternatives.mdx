[Sentry](/blog/posthog-vs-sentry) is one of the most widely-used error tracking tools on the market, and for good reason. It's mature, reliable, and most developers have used it at some point.

But Sentry isn't the only option. Whether you're looking for deeper product context, a more generous free tier, or a tool that combines error tracking with analytics and session replay, there are [strong alternatives worth considering](/blog/best-error-tracking-tools).

In this guide, we compare the best Sentry alternatives, including tools that go beyond traditional error monitoring to help you understand *who* is affected and *why* it matters – not just what broke.

## 1. PostHog

- **Founded:** 2020
- **Similar to:** Sentry, LogRocket
- **Typical users:** Engineers and product teams

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an all-in-one platform combining [error tracking](/error-tracking), [session replays](/session-replay), [product analytics](/product-analytics), [web analytics](/web-analytics), [A/B testing](/experiments), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [user surveys](/surveys), [LLM observability](/llm-analytics), and more into one product. 

This means it's not only an alternative to [Sentry](/blog/posthog-vs-sentry) but also tools like [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly).

#### Key features

- **Error tracking:** [Capture errors and exceptions](/docs/error-tracking/installation). Provide stack traces to debug issues. Correlate with product usage data.

- **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

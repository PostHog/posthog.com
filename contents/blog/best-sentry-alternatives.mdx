### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an open-source platform combining error tracking, session replays, product analytics, A/B testing, feature flags, user surveys, and more into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to [Sentry](/blog/posthog-vs-sentry) but also tools like [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly).

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of February 2025, 3,753 of the top 1 million websites deploy PostHog, far fewer than the 73,723 that use Sentry.

#### Key features

- 🚨 **Error tracking:** [Capture errors and exceptions](/docs/error-tracking/installation). Provide stack traces to debug issues. Correlate with product usage data.

- 📺 **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 🚩 **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### Why do companies use AppSignal?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/appsignal/reviews), AppSignal is praised for:

1. **Language-focus**: Reviewers appreciate AppSignal's support for their favorite languages, like Ruby and Elixir. They say it makes it easier to integrate AppSignal into their existing product.

2. **Ease-of-use**: AppSignal is easy to set up and use. It has a bunch of pre-built metrics and visualizations for monitoring their app.

> #### Bottom line
> For developers using one of the languages AppSignal supports, it's a great alternative to Sentry. Although their lack of a free tier might be a dealbreaker for some.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Sentry replacement if:

- You value transparency. We're open source and open core.
- You want all the tools to help you build a better product (like product analytics, session replays, and A/B testing).
- You want to try before you buy. We're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing).

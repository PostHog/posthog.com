[How Intercom Grows](https://www.howtheygrow.co/p/how-intercom-grows) explores how Intercom grew from $1m to $100m ARR in just five years. Some takeaways:

- Growth really exploded when they unbundled their product and embraced a [Jobs To Be Done](https://medium.com/make-us-proud/jobs-to-be-done-framework-748c761797a8) model to marketing their product.

- Avoid inflexible pricing models. Intercom employs different pricing strategies to address different ends of the market – self-service for small and mid-market companies, and complex sales for high-value enterprises.

- An effective content strategy + paid retargeting is a great way to keep potential customers warm and convince them to try your product.

[How to communicate effectively as a developer](https://www.karlsutt.com/articles/communicating-effectively-as-a-developer/) by Karl Sutt provides some useful tactical advice for developers:

- Slack et al. can drive people toward what Karl calls "low-resolution writing" – i.e. messages like "this [thing] isn't working" that don't communicate context. Even in Slack, it's worth taking time to craft useful messages with proper context.

- Good communication starts from taking an "unselfish perspective" – do what's easy for the reader, not for you, and don't expect readers to put up with your quirks.

- Bad writing compounds – all readers have to expend energy to digest and understand it, leading to frustration and inaction.

[Traits You Can Change, and Traits You Can't](https://staysaasy.com/leadership/2022/11/06/traits-you-can-change-and-traits-you-cant.html) via StaySaaSy:

- It's important to understand what traits can be coached and which can't when hiring or developing talent. Not doing so leads to missed opportunities or wasted time investing in the wrong people.

- **Traits you can change:** seeing the big picture; industry and technical knowledge; confidence; cultural norms; working with leadership. **Traits you can't change:** raw intelligence; emotional reactivity / intelligence; natural working speed.

- "Inexperienced but sharp team members who have all of the raw skills that you can’t coach can make great leaders. Don’t let them leave your company."

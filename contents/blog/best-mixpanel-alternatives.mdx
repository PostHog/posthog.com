[Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) has been a go-to product analytics platform for over a decade, and it's evolved significantly – adding session replay, heatmaps, A/B testing, and feature flags in recent years.

But Mixpanel isn't the only option. Whether you're looking for an all-in-one platform that includes error tracking and LLM analytics, transparent usage-based pricing, or a tool built specifically for engineering teams, there are alternatives worth considering.

In this guide, we compare the best Mixpanel alternatives – whether you need a focused analytics tool or an all-in-one platform for building better products.

## 1. PostHog

![posthog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/hogflix-dashboard.png)

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an open-source developer platform that combines [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/experiments), [user surveys](/surveys), [error tracking](/error-tracking), and more into one platform. This means it's not just an alternative to Mixpanel, but also [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar), [Optimizely](/blog/posthog-vs-optimizely), and [Split](/blog/best-split-alternatives)

### Key features

- **Product analytics**, including funnels, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Power users can create custom insights using SQL.

- **Web analytics** for tracking your marketing website – pageviews, bounce rate, traffic sources, UTM campaigns, and web vitals in a simple dashboard.

- **Session replays** with event timelines, console logs, network activity, DOM explorer, and performance metrics. 90-day retention with the ability to save individual replays offline indefinitely.

- **Heatmaps** showing clicks, scroll depth, and mouse movement overlaid on your actual site – viewable directly via the PostHog toolbar.

- **A/B tests** with up to 10 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculates recommended duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- **Surveys**, including open text, link with custom CTA, ratings (for [NPS, CSAT, and CES surveys](/product-engineers/nps-vs-csat-vs-ces)), single and multiple choice. Target users based on person properties, URL, or using existing feature flags.

- **Error tracking** to monitor exceptions, stack traces, and crashes – connected directly to session replays, user behavior, and feature flag changes.

- **Data warehouse** to import and query data from external sources like Stripe, Zendesk, Hubspot, or your existing warehouse – analyze business and product data together.

### Who uses PostHog?

Typical PostHog users are:

-   Product-minded engineering teams
-   Data-savvy product managers
-   Startups and mid-size enterprises

Customers include [Supabase](/customers/supabase), [Lovable](/customers/lovable), [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs), and [more](/customers).

/>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Main differences between PostHog and Mixpanel</summary>

- PostHog includes [error tracking](/error-tracking), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), and [surveys](/surveys) natively; Mixpanel doesn't offer these at all.
- PostHog charges up to 80% less for anonymous events; Mixpanel charges the same, higher rate for all events regardless.
- PostHog has a built-in [data warehouse](/data-stack) for importing external data (Stripe, Zendesk, etc.); Mixpanel relies on warehouse connectors and requires you to get data into a third-party warehouse first.
- Mixpanel's Experiments report is an Enterprise-only add-on; PostHog includes experiments on all plans with usage-based pricing.
- PostHog offers SQL access for custom queries; Mixpanel doesn't have a native SQL editor, requiring you to export your data instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Main similarities between PostHog and Mixpanel</summary>

- Both offer core product analytics: funnels, retention, cohorts, user paths, and trends.
- Both include A/B testing, feature flags, and session replay with web and mobile SDK support (iOS, Android, React Native).
- Both have AI-powered insight builders for natural language queries.
- Both are SOC 2 certified and GDPR-ready with EU data residency options.
- Both integrate with CDPs like Segment and Rudderstack, and data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery.

</details>

PostHog is the best choice if you like the idea of consolidating around one platform. Mixpanel offers third-party integrations for features it doesn't have, but this creates a messy workflow for teams.

PostHog also supports [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture). This means you don't have to manually instrument events. Instead, PostHog starts collecting data from the moment you implement its tracking snippet.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Mixpanel (product analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (session replay and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
>
> PostHog is the best Mixpanel alternative for startups and mid-size companies. It replaces Mixpanel and numerous other tools, saving money and time. Power user features, like an SQL insight builder and session replay logs, make it a good choice for engineering-led teams, too.

## 2. Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

![GA4](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/GA4.png)

### What is Google Analytics 4?

[Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) is a marketing and product analytics tool that's tightly integrated with other Google products, such as Ads, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Firebase.

Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics (GA3), it's event-based. It also introduces new report types, such as conversion funnels and retention tables. This makes it more useful to product teams than before.

### Key features

- **Web and app analytics** with event-based tracking, conversion funnels, retention tables, and user paths across websites and mobile apps.

- **Advertising analytics** with native Google Ads integration, campaign attribution, and ROI tracking across paid channels.

- **Predictive insights** powered by Google's machine learning – alerts you to trends, anomalies, and predicts churn and purchase probability.

- **Google ecosystem integration** with BigQuery for raw data access, Looker Studio for dashboards, Firebase for mobile, and Google Ads for attribution.

- **Natural language search** lets you ask specific questions like "MoM growth in users on iOS" rather than building reports manually.

### Who uses GA4?

Typical GA4 users are:

-   Marketing and content teams
-   Large news and content publishers
-   Enterprises who also use BigQuery

Google's huge scale means GA4 is used by both the biggest global corporations to SMBs of every kind. It is ubiquitous.

### How does GA4 compare to Mixpanel?

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['ga4', 'mixpanel']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics',
        'web_analytics',
        'product_analytics.features.advertising_analytics',
        'platform.tools.notebooks',

        'platform.pricing.transparent_pricing',
    ]}
/>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Main differences between GA4 and Mixpanel</summary>

- GA4 is optimized for marketing analytics and campaign attribution; Mixpanel is built for product analytics and user behavior.
- GA4 has native Google Ads integration for tracking ad spend and ROI; Mixpanel requires third-party connectors for advertising data.
- Mixpanel supports group analytics for B2B account-level tracking; GA4 doesn't have native group analytics.
- GA4 is free for most businesses (up to 10M events/month); Mixpanel's free tier is 1M events with paid plans scaling from there.
- Mixpanel now includes session replay, heatmaps, A/B testing, and feature flags; GA4 doesn't offer any of these.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Main similarities between GA4 and Mixpanel</summary>

- Both are event-based analytics platforms with funnels, retention, and cohort analysis.
- Both integrate with major data warehouses like BigQuery and Snowflake.
- Both provide custom dashboards and reporting capabilities.
- Both support mobile app analytics via Firebase (GA4) and native SDKs (Mixpanel).
- Both are used by large enterprises with significant compliance and scale requirements.

</details>

GA4 and Mixpanel are only superficially similar. They cover the same basics, but GA4 is better-suited to content and marketing teams, while Mixpanel is designed for product teams.

Note, GA4 doesn't support group analytics. This makes it easy to track aggregated usage at an account level, rather than at a user level – useful for tracking behavior in B2B products.

### Why do companies use GA4?

1. **Because it's Google:** It's not an original reason, but it holds true. Using Google Analytics makes a lot of sense for teams who rely on other Google platforms, like Google Ads and BigQuery.

2. **It's powerful and free:** Likewise, Google's scale means [GA4 is completely free](/blog/google-analytics-cost) to most small and medium-sized businesses. This, combined with strong analytical tools and the large ecosystem of GA experts to call upon, makes it a safe choice.

3. **To track marketing ROI:** GA4 is predominantly used by marketing and e-commerce teams to track campaign ROI. It's also popular among large content publishers for its scalability.

> #### Bottom line
>
> GA4 is the best Mixpanel alternative for marketing teams who want to track ROI on campaigns, and a good option for B2C and e-commerce platforms. Product teams, especially those working on B2B products, should look elsewhere.

## 3. Amplitude

![amplitude](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/ammplitude.png)

### What is Amplitude?

[Amplitude](/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives) is an analytics and testing tool with a particular focus on large enterprise customers, like Zoom, NBCUniversal, and Walmart.

### Key features

- **Product analytics** with funnel and retention analysis, user paths, behavioral cohorts, custom dashboards, and SQL access for power users.

- **Session replay** to watch real user sessions and understand behavior qualitatively – includes heatmaps on Growth/Enterprise plans.

- **A/B testing** with support for JSON payloads, primary, secondary, and guardrail metrics. Web Experimentation includes a visual editor.

- **Feature flags** for controlled rollouts and targeting specific user segments based on behavioral cohorts.

- **Warehouse-native analytics** that queries data directly from Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks without moving it.

- **AI insight builder** that generates insights based on natural language requests, like "What is my purchase conversion rate?".

- **Customer data platform** that combines analytics data with third-party tools for data governance, identity resolution, and audience syncing.

### Who uses Amplitude?

Typical Amplitude users are:

-   Non-technical product managers
-   Data teams at large enterprises
-   Growth engineering and marketing teams
-   Companies with stringent compliance needs

While it offers a limited free tier for startups, high prices are a barrier. As one reviewer [points out](https://www.g2.com/products/amplitude-analytics/reviews/amplitude-analytics-review-7933567): "The high price tag poses a challenge for small businesses, early-stage, and even medium-sized startups."

### How does Amplitude compare to Mixpanel?

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['amplitude', 'mixpanel']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics',
        'web_analytics',
        'experiments',
        'platform.tools.notebooks',
        'product_analytics.insights.ai_insight_builder',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'platform.security.role_based_access_control',
    ]}
/>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Main differences between Amplitude and Mixpanel</summary>

- Amplitude offers warehouse-native analytics that queries data directly in your warehouse; Mixpanel syncs data bidirectionally but doesn't sit on top of your warehouse.
- Amplitude's session replay launched earlier with deeper analytics integration; Mixpanel's is newer but includes mobile support and AI summaries.
- Amplitude includes Guides & Surveys as a paid add-on; Mixpanel doesn't offer native survey functionality.
- Amplitude targets larger enterprises with more complex compliance needs; Mixpanel is more accessible to mid-market companies.
- Mixpanel's feature flags and experiments are newer (late 2025); Amplitude has had experimentation longer.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Main similarities between Amplitude and Mixpanel</summary>

- Both are established product analytics platforms with 10+ years in market.
- Both now offer session replay, heatmaps, A/B testing, and feature flags.
- Both provide AI-powered natural language querying for building insights.
- Both support group analytics for B2B account-level tracking.
- Both integrate with CDPs like Segment and data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery.
- Both are SOC 2 certified and GDPR-ready with EU data residency options.
- Both serve large enterprise customers with complex data governance requirements.

</details>

On paper, Amplitude and Mixpanel are very similar, but they differ in focus and approach. While both products serve large enterprise customers, Amplitude is more focused on these users. 

### Why do companies use Amplitude?

1. **Reducing load on data teams:** Amplitude is designed to enable non-technical to self-serve analytics. Amplitude [cites](https://amplitude.com/case-studies/nbc) NBCUniversal as a company that's benefited from its data team spending less time responding to requests for analysis.

2. **Large-scale experimentation:** Unlike Mixpanel, Amplitude offers a built-in experimentation add-on. This enables companies to run experiments on users using existing cohorts created in Amplitude.

3. **Resolving data quality problems:** Companies that use Amplitude, particularly large ones, often migrate from outdated, or self-built, tools that generate poor quality data. Amplitude helps them fix that, while also making analytics more accessible.

> #### Bottom line
>
> Amplitude is the best Mixpanel alternative for large enterprise companies who want to reduce the load on expensive, overworked data science teams. Startups and mid-size companies might find there are better-value alternatives

## 4. Heap

![heap](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/heap.png)

### What is Heap?

Heap describes itself as a Digital Insights Platform. Unpacking that a bit, it means Heap offers both product analytics and session replay, and supports marketing use cases with multitouch attribution.

Heap was [acquired in September 2023](https://contentsquare.com/heap/) by [Contentsquare](/blog/best-contentsquare-alternatives), a marketing and e-commerce analytics firm, and announced plans to integrate the two products.

### Key features

> #### Bottom line
>
> Heap is basically Mixpanel with autocapture. This makes it a decent choice for non-technical product teams, but it's not radically different.

<details>
<summary>Honorable mentions</summary>

This guide focuses on the most popular Mixpanel alternatives, but these aren't the only ones. Here are some other tools worth considering:

- **[Pendo](/blog/best-pendo-alternatives)** describes itself as a product experience platform. It combines analytics with in-app guides, user feedback widgets, roadmap planning, and product discovery tools. Best for product teams who want onboarding and adoption tools alongside analytics.

- **Kissmetrics** is more focused on marketing and e-commerce use cases than Mixpanel. It's worth considering if you want to focus on channel attribution and revenue tracking, but don't want to use GA4.

- **Snowplow** is a powerful, open-source behavioral data platform. It can replace tools like Mixpanel, but requires significant data engineering resources to set up and maintain. Best for large enterprises with well-staffed data teams who want full control over their data pipeline.

- **Countly** is an open-source analytics platform with strong mobile app support, push notifications, and crash analytics. It offers both self-hosted and cloud options, making it a good choice for teams who need data sovereignty.

- **[Plausible](/blog/best-plausible-alternatives)** and **[Fathom](/blog/best-fathom-alternatives)** are privacy-first, lightweight analytics tools. They're not direct Mixpanel replacements – they focus on simple website metrics rather than product analytics – but they're worth considering if GDPR compliance and minimal data collection are priorities.

For more options, see our guide to the [best open-source product analytics tools](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools).

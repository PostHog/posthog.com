### New: Feature Flag Persistence across authentication steps

For posthog-js only for now, but you can ensure that users get a consistent experience with feature flags across login steps. This is great for experiments where you'd want the same user to be shown the same variant throughout, no matter how their userID changes. [Read more](https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/feature-flags#persisting-feature-flags-across-authentication-steps)

### Improved: Funnel Breakdown Attribution

You can now choose which specific funnel step a breakdown property should come from, and if the same value should be copied over to other funnel steps or not for analysis. [Read more here](https://posthog.com/docs/user-guides/funnels#choosing-breakdown-property-behaviour)

### New: Four new apps released

The community has been busy building many new apps for the PostHog app store and we're excited to announce the following apps have been released for users on PostHog Cloud...

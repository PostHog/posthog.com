## 1. PostHog

- **Founded:** 2020
- **Similar to:** Fullstory, LogRocket
- **Typical users:** Engineers and product teams

![PostHog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/best-pendo-alternatives/posthog.png)

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an open-source platform that combines [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [A/B testing](/experiments), and [feature flags](/feature-flags). It also has a [data warehouse for startups](/docs/data-warehouse) and a [customer data platform (CDP)](/docs/cdp). This means it's not only an alternative to UXCam, but also tools like [Statsig](/blog/posthog-vs-statsig) and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly).

By combining all these tools into one platform, it eliminates the need for stitching together integrations between third-party tools, and makes it easier for engineers to work with data. PostHog is popular with engineering-led companies, like AI startup [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs) and [carVertical](/feature-flags), which use PostHog for both session replays and analytics.

#### Key features

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your app. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Experiment in your app with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Auto-calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 🚩 **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- 🏠 **Data warehouse:** Combine data from all your different sources for easy analysis and comprehensive insights.

### How does PostHog compare to UXCam?

UXCam is solely focused on mobile apps. PostHog, however, supports both mobile and web apps, with SDKs for all popular web and mobile frameworks, including React Native.

This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and build better products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, and testing solutions with A/B tests.

3. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

> #### Bottom line

Want to know how PostHog and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) compare? If you remember nothing else, remember these two things:

1. **Google Analytics** is primarily designed for marketers who want to analyze landing pages, compare marketing channels, and return on ad spend.

2. **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform built to help engineers understand users and create better products. It includes analytics and a whole bunch more.

## How is PostHog different to Google Analytics?

### 1. PostHog does more than analytics

[Analytics](/product-analytics) is a core part of our platform, but it's just one component in a set of important tools for product teams. PostHog enables you to collect feedback with [surveys](/docs/surveys), understand user behavior with [session replays](/session-replay), test changes with [A/B tests](/ab-testing), and deploy changes with [feature flags](/feature-flags).

### 2. PostHog is built for engineers

We support all popular (and some unpopular) [SDKs](/docs/libraries), have [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), and a [powerful SQL query builder](/docs/hogql), so you can analyze data how you want. We make it easy to [test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production), conduct [phased rollouts](/tutorials/phased-rollout), run [beta programs](/tutorials/public-beta-program), and so much more.

### 3. PostHog is open source and transparent

PostHog is built with transparency at its core. We work in the open and give full access to our [source code](https://github.com/PostHog), and enable you to [build integrations](/docs/apps/build) and [other services](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server) on top of the product. You can even give feedback on [our public roadmap](/roadmap).

## Core features

PostHog offers a wider selection of features than GA4, which focuses solely on analytics. This makes PostHog better suited for teams who are building products.

## Analytics features

Both GA4 and PostHog offer analytics, but _what_ they offer is drastically different. 

GA4 has better features for calculating monetization and ROI on Google Ads and other marketing campaigns. This is particularly helpful for e-commerce websites. 

PostHog, on the other hand, focuses on providing insights on product and feature usage. The biggest difference is [group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics), which enable you to track metrics at an account or company level – a feature which GA4 lacks. This makes PostHog especially useful for building B2B SaaS products.

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Toolbar" description="View insights on your live website or app with an overlay" />
</ComparisonTable>

## Apps and integrations

Because PostHog is built to be your single source of truth for viewing data, it's very simple to import data from other sources. 

In contrast, it's hard to import data into GA4 because:

1. The data type and format you're allowed to [import into GA4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10071301) is restrictive. 
2. You either need to constantly upload CSV files manually, or set up an SFTP server to automatically do this for you.

However, GA4 is well integrated into the Google ecosystem, making it easy to transfer data between it and other Google products.

Below is a comparison of some of the most popular apps. For a full list of PostHog’s available integrations, [check our app directory](/cdp).

> One unique advantage of PostHog is that, because it is open source, it’s easy to [create your own apps and integrations](/tutorials/build-your-own-posthog-app). This is useful if you’re, for example, using niche software in your stack that hasn’t been widely adopted, or if you require a direct integration between PostHog and your product. 

## Privacy, compliance, and security

PostHog makes GDPR compliance easy by letting you choose where your data is hosted: EU or US. PostHog also offers cookie-less tracking, and a variety of security options to keep your data secure. 

GA4 also offers various [privacy controls](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9019185), but you can't choose where your data is stored.

## Frequently asked questions 

### Does PostHog have reports, dimensions, and other GA4 features?

Yes, PostHog has much of the same functionality as Google Analytics, but much of it is named differently. Here’s a quick comparison of the two:

> Familiar with Google Analytics and want more information on how to use PostHog? We've written a [guide to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog).

### How much do PostHog and Google Analytics cost?

GA4 has a free tier which should be sufficient for most startups and scale-ups. Larger enterprises with higher data collection and export requirements will need to upgrade to GA360, which starts at $50,000 per year. 

A good rule of thumb is that if you're exporting more than 1 million events per day, or querying data with more than 10 million events, you'll need to upgrade to GA360 (see a full breakdown on [their website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11202874)). 

PostHog has transparent pricing based on the usage. It’s free to get started and completely free for the first 1 million analytics events. After this free monthly allowance, you'll pay $0.00031/event, and PostHog charges progressively less the more you use. We recommend trying [our pricing calculator](/pricing) and reading our [guide for estimating your usage](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs).

### Does PostHog offer a free trial?

With PostHog, you don’t need a free trial — it’s free to get started, with a generous monthly allowance of events, replays, and feature flag requests. If you’re within this allowance, PostHog is free to use forever.

### Are there discounts for nonprofits and startups?

Yes, PostHog offers both. Nonprofit organizations can contact our team and are usually eligible for a 50% discount, while startups can sign up for $50,000 of free credit (and a host of other perks) in the [PostHog for Startups program](/startups).

Want to know how PostHog and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) compare? If you remember nothing else, remember these two things:

1. **Google Analytics** is designed for marketers who want to analyze landing pages, compare marketing channels, and return on ad spend.

2. **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform built to help engineers understand users and create better products. It includes analytics and a whole bunch more.

## How is PostHog different to Google Analytics?

### 1. PostHog does more than analytics

[Analytics](/product-analytics) is a core part of our platform, but it's just one component in a set of important tools for product teams. PostHog enables you to collect feedback with [surveys](/docs/surveys), understand user behavior with [session replays](/session-replay), test changes with [A/B tests](/ab-testing), and deploy changes with [feature flags](/feature-flags).

### 2. PostHog is built for engineers

We support all popular (and some unpopular) [SDKs](/docs/libraries), have [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), and a [powerful SQL query builder](/docs/hogql), so you can analyze data how you want. We make it easy to [test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production), conduct [phased rollouts](/tutorials/phased-rollout), run [beta programs](/tutorials/public-beta-program), and so much more.

### 3. PostHog is open source and transparent

PostHog is built with transparency at its core. We work in the open and give full access to our [source code](https://github.com/PostHog), and enable you to [build integrations](/docs/apps/build) and [other services](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server) on top of the product. You can even give feedback on [our public roadmap](/roadmap).

## Comparing PostHog and Google Analytics

PostHog offers a wider selection of features than GA4, which focuses solely on analytics. This makes PostHog better suited for teams who are building products.

### Analytics

Both GA4 and PostHog offer analytics, but _what_ they offer is drastically different: 

- **Google Analytics** makes it easier to calculate monetization and ROI on Google Ads and other marketing campaigns. 

- **PostHog focuses** makes it easier to understand how people use web and mobile apps. The biggest difference is [group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics), which enable you to track metrics at an account or company level – a feature which GA4 lacks. This makes PostHog especially useful for building B2B SaaS products.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Google Analytics">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Group analytics" description="Track metrics at account or company level" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Traffic breakdown" description="Gain insights into where your visitors and conversions are coming from" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="User paths" description="Track user flows and where they drop-off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Retention" description="Analyze user and revenue retention" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Monetization analytics" description="Track purchase value, LTV, and other revenue metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Advertising analytics" description="Track ROI on Google Ads and other marketing campaigns" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Real-time reporting" description="Monitor activity on your site or app as it happens." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Predictive insights" description="AI-powered alerts when metrics change" />
</ComparisonTable>

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Automatically highlight factors affecting funnel conversion rates" />

</ComparisonTable>

### Integrations

Because PostHog is built to be your single source of truth for viewing data, it's very simple to import data from other sources. 

In contrast, it's hard to import data into GA4 because:

1. The data type and format you're allowed to [import into GA4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10071301) is restrictive. 
2. You either need to constantly upload CSV files manually, or set up an SFTP server to automatically do this for you.

However, Google Analytics is well integrated into the Google ecosystem, making it easy to transfer data between it and other Google products.

Below is a comparison of some of the most popular apps. For a full list of PostHog’s available integrations, [check our app directory](/cdp).

</ComparisonTable>

> One unique advantage of PostHog is that, because it is open source, it’s easy to [create your own apps and integrations](/tutorials/build-your-own-posthog-app). This is useful if you’re, for example, using niche software in your stack that hasn’t been widely adopted, or if you require a direct integration between PostHog and your product. 

### Security and compliance

PostHog makes GDPR compliance easy by letting you choose where your data is hosted: EU or US. PostHog also offers cookie-less tracking, and a variety of security options to keep your data secure. Google also offers various [privacy controls](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9019185), but you can't choose where your data is stored.

> Familiar with Google Analytics and want more information on how to use PostHog? We've written a [guide to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog).

### How much do PostHog and Google Analytics cost?

GA4 has a free tier which should be sufficient for most startups and scale-ups. Larger enterprises with higher data collection and export requirements will need to upgrade to GA360, which starts at $50,000 per year. 

A good rule of thumb is that if you're exporting more than 1 million events per day, or querying data with more than 10 million events, you'll need to upgrade to GA360 (see a full breakdown on [their website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11202874)). 

PostHog has transparent pricing based on the usage. It’s free to get started and completely free for the first 1 million analytics events. After this free monthly allowance, you'll pay $0.00031/event, and PostHog charges progressively less the more you use. We recommend trying [our pricing calculator](/pricing) and reading our [guide for estimating your usage](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs).

### Does PostHog offer a free trial?

With PostHog, you don’t need a free trial — it’s free to get started, with a generous monthly allowance of events, replays, and feature flag requests. If you’re within this allowance, PostHog is free to use forever.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default).

### What about ad blockers?

We recommend all users deploy a reverse proxy, which enables you send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain. Events sent from your own domain and are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers, ensuring you capture the best data possible. We have [reverse proxy setup guides](/docs/advanced/proxy) for AWS Cloudfront, Caddy, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, and more, in our docs.

### Are there discounts for nonprofits and startups?

Yes, PostHog offers both. Nonprofit organizations can contact our team and are usually eligible for a 50% discount, while startups can sign up for $50,000 of free credit (and a host of other perks) in the [PostHog for Startups program](/startups).

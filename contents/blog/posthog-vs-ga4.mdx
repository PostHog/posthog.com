## How is PostHog different?

### 1. It's an all-in-one platform

PostHog combines product and [web analytics](/web-analytics) with other useful tools, such as [session replay](/session-replay), [A/B testing](/ab-testing), and [surveys](/surveys), to give you a complete toolset for undertstanding user behavior. They're all tightly integrated, so you don't have to waste time importing and exporting data between different products.

### 2. We're open source and transparent

This means you can inspect [our source code](https://github.com/PostHog), [build your own integrations](/docs/cdp/build), and even vote on what we should build via [our public roadmap](/roadmap). We do everything out in the open, including sharing all our internal processes in [our public handbook](/handbook). 

### 3. We build for developers first

This means we offer powerful features for developers, such as [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), so you can pull data into your app and update metadata programmatically. Our [SQL query builder](/docs/hogql) lets you analyze data how you want, and feature flags make it easy to [test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production), conduct [phased rollouts](/tutorials/phased-rollout), run [beta programs](/tutorials/public-beta-program), and so much more.

## Comparison

### Analytics

In a nutshell:

- **Google Analytics** makes it easy to calculate monetization and ROI on Google Ads and other marketing campaigns. This is the main reason most companies use it.

- **PostHog** makes it easy to understand how people use web and mobile apps using features like [group analytics](/docs/product-analytics/group-analytics), which enable you to track metrics at an account or company level. This makes PostHog especially useful for building B2B SaaS products.

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Dark mode" description="Choose between light and dark UI" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Integrations

It's hard to import data into Google Analytics because:

1. The data type and format you're allowed to [import](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10071301) is restrictive. 
2. You either need to constantly upload CSV files manually, or set up an SFTP server to automatically do this for you.

In contrast, PostHog is built to be your single source of truth, so it's simple to import data from other sources using our [built-in data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse), or send PostHog data to other tools. You can even [create your own integrations](/docs/cdp/build). 

Below is a comparison of some of the most popular apps – see our [data pipeline](/docs/cdp/airbyte-export) and [warehouse docs](/docs/data-warehouse/setup) for a complete list of integrations.

### Security and compliance

PostHog makes GDPR compliance easy by letting you choose where your data is hosted: EU or US. PostHog also offers cookie-less tracking, and a variety of security options to keep your data secure. Google also offers various [privacy controls](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9019185), but you can't choose where your data is stored.

### How much do PostHog and Google Analytics cost?

Google Analytics has a free tier which should be sufficient for most startups and scale-ups. Larger enterprises with higher data collection and export requirements will need to upgrade to GA360, which _starts_ at $50,000 per year. 

A good rule of thumb is that if you're exporting more than 1 million events per day, or querying data with more than 10 million events, you'll need to upgrade to GA360 (see a full breakdown on [their website](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11202874)). 

PostHog has transparent pricing based on the usage. It's free to get started and completely free for the first 1 million analytics events. After this free monthly allowance you're charged based on usage – we charge progressively less per event the more you use. 

We recommend trying [our pricing calculator](/pricing) to estimate your costs.

### Does PostHog offer a free trial?

With PostHog, you don't need a free trial — it's free to get started, with a generous monthly allowance of events, replays, and feature flag requests. If you’re within this allowance, PostHog is free to use forever.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default).

### What about ad blockers?

We recommend all users deploy a reverse proxy, which enables you send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain. 

Events sent from your own domain and are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers, ensuring you capture the best data possible. We have [reverse proxy setup guides](/docs/advanced/proxy) for AWS Cloudfront, Caddy, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, and more, in our docs.

### Are there discounts for non-profits and startups?

Yes, PostHog offers both. Non-profit organizations can contact our team and are usually eligible for a 50% discount, while startups can sign up for $50,000 of free credit (and a host of other perks) in the [PostHog for Startups program](/startups).

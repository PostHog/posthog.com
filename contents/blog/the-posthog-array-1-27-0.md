### Community MVP üèÜ

Thanks to all our community members for helping move PostHog forward! This release cycle's Community MVP goes to... [DimitrisMazarakis](https://github.com/DimitrisMazarakis)!

Dimitris added an option to automatically refresh dashboards every couple of minutes. You can now have your PostHog dashboards in separate monitors or your conference room TV always in sync! Thanks for driving this forward, Dimitris!

## PostHog 1.27.0 Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

**In this release:**

- [Brand-new funnels experience](#new-funnels-experience).
- [Significant revamp on the legend table & tooltips on insights](#revamp-of-legend-table--insight-tooltips).
- [New action, event, cohorts & properties selector](#new-filter-experience).
- [ClickHouse is now free to use](#clickhouse-is-now-free-to-use).
### New Funnels Experience

Funnels have a new bar-chart visualization and show more comprehensive metrics. You can now choose whether to display conversion rates for the full funnel or from each step to the next.

![Funnel steps](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/funnel-steps.png)

Breakdowns are now supported on funnels! This allows you to identify how user and event properties (for instance, browser or referral source) affect your conversions.

![Funnel breakdowns](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/funnel-breakdowns.png)

Clicking on a funnel step will reveal a list of persons who have continued or dropped off at that step. From there, you can easily view their sessions (provided you have Session Recording enabled) to find unknown problems or opportunities that would otherwise be hidden in the data.

Going beyond averages, the new **Time to Convert** view shows a distribution of time spent between steps or for the whole funnel.

### Revamp of legend table & insight tooltips

The legend table for Insights has received a major styling revamp, including nicer formatting for dates and numbers and clearer identification of breakdown values.

New tooltips allow you to scan and compare multiple values at a glance.

### New filter experience

It's now easier than ever to find the event, user, or cohort definitions you're looking for when adding a filter to a query. This change also causes Insights to load significantly faster.

### ClickHouse is now free to use!

A few months after PostHog we started hitting limitations on some operations running on Postgres. We then decided to develop full support for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse</a> backend. ClickHouse is a very powerful OLAP database that works specially well at computing analytics for huge volumes of data. At first this ClickHouse backend was launched as a premium feature requiring an Enterprise license. Some weeks ago we decided to offer a free version with a restriction of 3 team members to serve as trial for the feature.

Since then, we have ironed out all the details and have now decided to make this feature **fully free** now, no longer requiring a license nor having any additional restrictions. This comes from our commitment to supporting teams and companies of any size, so you can continue using PostHog for free even if your event volume increases significantly.

ClickHouse is deployed a bit differently than our [traditional deployment options](/docs/self-host/overview#deploy), you can find full deployment instructions here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PostHog/charts-clickhouse/">https://github.com/PostHog/charts-clickhouse/</a>

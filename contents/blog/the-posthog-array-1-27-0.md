### Community MVP üèÜ

Thanks to all our community members for helping move PostHog forward! This release cycle's Community MVP goes to...

[DimitrisMazarakis](https://github.com/DimitrisMazarakis)!

Dimitris added an option to automatically refresh dashboards every couple of minutes. You can now have your PostHog dashboards in separate monitors or your conference room TV always in sync! Thanks for driving this forward Dimitris!

Open source has several key advantages of traditional Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) business models. We think most companies building software will launch this way in the future.

## It's far easier to build something useful

### More people will try it out

In the early days, startups are *ravenous* for feedback. It's the easiest way to build something that people want. It's very, very unlikely you'll hit the nail on the head with the first thing that you launch - it'll invariably need iteration or a complete pivot.

You know those [generic looking launches](https://www.google.com/search?q=startup+one+page+template&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB833GB833&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiT8a_yk6LrAhVZShUIHYpwAMcQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw&biw=1745&bih=1832)? E8ven if the product looks awesome, the thought of security issues with how your data is handled, or the service disappearing in a few months scare off many technical users.

If your software is hosted only, then users have to be willing to give up some of their time *and* somewhere from a little to a lot of their data in exchange for feedback, as a minimum. The less stuff you have to ask for, the easier it is to get a yes. Open source means your users can self host if they want to, so now it's just a time thing.

More usage means more feedback, especially when places like GitHub are *designed* for people to raise issues / feature requests. The vast majority of open source users already have a GitHub account and can just raise an issue. SaaS product feedback in the early days usually involves emails/phone calls/Slack groups. Open source has all of this available *and* their community of users are already used to leaving feedback in the repo.

Just look at the YCombinator launches for open source to get a sense of what gets a good reception from the HackerNews community:

*INSERT SOME DATA BASED ON LAUNCH HNS*

###Â Your work is public

Goodbye hardcoding stuff. It's easier to take pride in your work when it's completely visible. This can make shipping a little slower, but we've found this is outweighed by new developers finding the codebase much easier to get started with - let alone the value in proper documentation.

## Building a better team

Open source attracts more developers.

Open source carries a sense of purpose automatically - it's pretty nifty being able to say anyone in the world is welcome to use or modify what you're working on, even if they've no money to spend. It's gratifying to be offering something for free that lots of people can find useful.

I mean, people just want to work on something that will be [placed in a vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) in the Arctic, to last the next 1,000 years.

## Big companies can use it

If you've ever tried to sell software to huge organizations, it's typical to spend 1 to 12 months going through information security processes. Often these are due to concerns with sending data to your infrastructure.

Open source means they can inspect the entire codebase and they can self deploy. Within weeks of starting to write the project we had some of the world's largest organizations using us.

## Your users are nicer to you

Open source software encourages trust with its users. After all, you can see exactly what the code is doing.

We've found that developers are really willing to put up with bugs or problems with your codebase - as they are able to fix or fill in the gaps that you may have. If your SaaS only company has lots of bugs, users have to wait for you to fix stuff.

Open source has a wonderful culture of developers filing bugs so they can alert you to problems you may not have found yourself, and as a project grows in popularity, many users will start fixing issues in a cool hive-mind like way!

## There's one proviso

If this makes you think "heck, we better open source our thing", great. However, the advantages above won't all apply if it's something that developers don't care about. If it's a system that would only have interactions (whether day to day use or implementation) with non technical users, then you're out of luck.

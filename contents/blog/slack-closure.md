One of the great things about being open source is that we’ve grown a vibrant community around the project. Since launch we’ve accepted code from over 500 contributors and swapped ideas with thousands of users in our public Slack group. 

Now though, we’ve decided to close our public Slack group in order to create a better, stronger, and more helpful PostHog community elsewhere. In this post I’ll explain why we’re doing this, and what comes next. 

> **Tl;dr:** We’re closing the Slack group on XX/XX/XX and inviting members to join us in the thriving [PostHog Community](/questions) instead, where XX users have already asked XX questions in the last six months. This decision only impacts the public Slack group, not the private Slack channels for users spending over $2,000 per month.

## Why we're changing the way we do community

PostHog has grown incredibly fast but over the last four years the public Slack group has remained the central hub of our community. It's been a place where we can chat to users, discuss feature requests, answer questions, and solicit feedback. 

However, with over 5,000 members now posting regularly, it's become hard to keep up with the conversations before they disappear into the ether of Slack's message history.

We've explored a few things to fix this, including paid plans (the cheapest of which is $7.25 per user, per month) or [building our own AI bot](/blog/aruba-hackathon#maxai-our-friendly-posthog-support-ai), but it's only in the last six months we feel we've found a solution.

## Introducing the PostHog community

The PostHog community platform has technically been available for several months now, but we're finally ready to make it official. We're confident that the PostHog community platform will give you a better experience than Slack. 

You can already post questions and answers directly to the site, select preferred solutions, filter by topic, create profiles, comment on articles, and search thoroughly to find the information you need. We also bring all of your interactions into one place, so that you can see everything an individual has posted from their profile page. 

Best of all, everything is indexed by search engines and stays online permanently - meaning every post can help other users for years to come. 

All of this is just for starters, however. In the future we plan to add even more features, including the ability to vote on questions to give them more (or less!) visibility, and the ability for individuals to post in other sections of the site. If you have ideas for how else we can improve the community, we'd love to hear them!

You can, of course, continue to use the in-app options for reporting bugs, giving feedback, or asking for support. We’ll also continue to operate the dedicated Slack channels for users who spend over $2,000 per month. However, by creating our own platform for the PostHog community we're able to ensure it keeps scaling in line with everything else and that we can give you the best possible experience. It's already a far better place to have discussions than Slack, so we recommend signing up for an account today!

## What happens next?

On XX/XX/XX we will archive all channels in the public PostHog chat, so that no new discussion or replies can be posted. This will allow everyone chance to move their on-going conversations to a new location, such as the PostHog community, without losing anything. 

A week later, on XX/XX/XX, we will close the Slack group permanently and delete all existing content. 

Private Slack channels for paying users will continue to function as normal via Slack Connect, and we’ll continue to handle the majority of customer support via the in-app help. Obviously the GitHub repos will also continue to function, so you can chat with our team and make code contributions there too. 

We’d like to thank everyone who participated in the Slack group over the last four years, whose support and encouragement has helped us immensely. We’ve deeply enjoyed speaking to many of you and the feedback you’ve given us has been invaluable — we very much hope that all of you will join us in the new community and continue to follow our progress there!

When developing software, there's no shortage of work: building new features, fixing bugs, maintaining infrastructure,
launching new systems, phasing out deprecated solutions, ensuring security, keeping track of dependencies…
Whew. And that is just the pure code part, product and people considerations aside.

Some of the above work requires a human brain every single time – software is all 1s and 0s, but (un)fortunately
in the end it serves human purposes. Until a massive breakthrough in artificial intelligence occurs, figuring out
features that compile AND suit human needs programmatically remains a pipe dream.

What about… all these tedious tasks though? Running tests, publishing releases, deploying services,
keeping the repository clean. Plain chores – boring and following the same pattern every time.
All still important though!  
We don't need any sort of AI for that. All we need is to define jobs that need to be done, and have those jobs run
based on certain triggers. Non-AI software can do this.  
And if our jobs software is integrated with version control? Things become just so easy.

## Automation 101

This is where GitHub Actions come in. With Actions you can define per-repository **workflows** which run
on robust **runner** virtual machines. They run every time a specific type of event happens – say, push to `main`,
pull request commit, addition of an issue label, or manual workflow dispatch. A workflow consists of any number
of **jobs**, each job being a series of **steps** that run a shell script _or_ a standalone action.
Standalone actions can be ran directly if written in TypeScript, or with the overhead of a Docker container
for ultimate flexibility, and a multitude of them is freely available on
the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)

This sounds pretty powerful already. But let's see where all this can truly take us with some concrete examples
[right out of PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog).

Mind you, similar things can be achieved with competing solutions such as GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins. GitHub Actions
do have a seriously robust ecosystem though, despite being a relative newcomer, and at PostHog we've been avid users
of GitHub since before the dotcom bubble – hence the focus of this article.

### Unit testing

Unit tests are crucial for ensuring reliability of software. Don't skip writing them if you're building anything
for real! But after that make sure that you don't skip also _running_ them. The latter you can do that by just running
them _on each PR_ as it's being worked on. This used to be called ["extreme programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), but today it's a standard practice.

Here's a relevant basic workflow for Django: it checks whether a migration is missing, then runs test.

Note how by defining a **matrix** we make this happen for three specified Python versions in parallel! This way
we guarantee support of a range of versions.

```YAML
on:
    - pull_request

jobs:
    django-tests:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        strategy:
            fail-fast: false
            matrix:
                python-version: ['3.7.8', '3.8.5', '3.9.0']
        steps:
            - name: Check out the repository
            ses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Set up Python
              uses: actions/setup-python@v2
              with:
                  python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

            - name: Install pip dependencies
              run: |
                  python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

            - name: Check if a migration is missing
              run: python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run

            - name: Run unit tests
              run: python manage.py test
```

### End-to-end testing

Some tests should cover not just the building blocks, but the assembled machine that your users expect
to work as expected, well, end-to-end. We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for that, and while not perfect,
[it's been a boon for us](/blog/cypress-end-to-end-tests). Here's the essence of our Cypress CI workflow:

```YAML
on:
    - pull_request

jobs:
    e2e-tests:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Check out the repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Setup Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
                node-version: 14

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: yarn

          - name: Build and start application
            run: echo "This is where you boot your application for testing"

          - name: Run end-to-end Cypress tests
            uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2

          - name: Archive test screenshots
            if: failure()
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
            with:
                name: screenshots
                path: cypress/screenshots
```

### Linting and formatting

We've covered functionality tests. Unit and end-to-end tests verify that things _work_ as expected. But code should not
only work, it should also be _written_ in a sensible way, so that we don't end up with messy spaghetti after adding
new features. Tools to ensure that exist, and they are:
- linters, for making sure that best practices are used in the code and nothing funky is slipping through
- formatters, for standardizing the look of our code and making it readable.

As with tests, it's great to run this on every PR to ensure that the code that lands in master is high quality.

```YAML
on:
    - pull_request

jobs:
    code-quality:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Check out the repository 
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Set up Node
              uses: actions/setup-node@v1
              with:
                  node-version: 14

            - name: Install package.json dependencies with Yarn
              run: yarn

            - name: Check formatting with prettier
              run: yarn prettier .

            - name: Lint with ESLint
              run: yarn eslint .
```

### Deploying continuously

We utilize [continuous deployment](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-deployment)
for PostHog Cloud and we've been very happy with the results – our Amazon ECS-based stack is deployed automatically
on each push to `master` (that is a PR being merged), and it'

```YAML
on:
    push:
        branches:
            - master

jobs:
    build-and-deploy-production:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Configure AWS credentials
              uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1

                  aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

            - name: Log into Amazon ECR
              id: login-ecr

            - name: Fetch posthog-cloud
              run: |
                  curl -L https://github.com/posthog/posthog-cloud/tarball/master | tar --strip-components=1 -xz --
                  mkdir deploy/

            - name: Check out main repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

                  IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
              run: |
                  docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG -f prod.web.Dockerfile .
                  docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
                  echo "::set-output name=image::$ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG"

            - name: Fill in the new app image ID in the Amazon ECS task definition
              id: task-def-app
              uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
              with:

                  container-name: production
                  image: ${{ steps.build-image.outputs.image }}

            - name: Fill in the new migration image ID in the Amazon ECS task definition

                  aws ecs run-task --cluster production-cluster --count 1 --launch-type FARGATE --task-definition production-migration
              env:

                  task-definition: ${{ steps.task-def-web.outputs.task-definition }}
                  service: production
                  cluster: production-cluster
```

### Verifying build

Docker is now a standard way of building images of software to be deployed. We use it too, quite happily…
but a few times we broke the build. Make a mistake somewhere, and the image may just not build at all. So we've taken
to testing image building _ahead_ of time – that is before `master` is broken – on every PR push.

We also _lint_ the Dockerfiles using [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint), which has been giving us
some really useful tips for maximum reliability of our Docker-based build process.

```YAML
name: Docker

on:
    - pull_request

jobs:
    test-image-build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Check out the repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Lint Dockerfiles with Hadolint
              run: |
                  # Install latest Hadolint binary from GitHub (not available via apt)
                  HADOLINT_LATEST_TAG=$( \
                    curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/hadolint/hadolint/releases/latest" | jq -r .tag_name \
                  )
                  sudo curl -sLo /usr/bin/hadolint \
                    "https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/download/$HADOLINT_LATEST_TAG/hadolint-Linux-x86_64"
                  sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/hadolint
                  hadolint **Dockerfile

            - name: Set up QEMU
              uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v1

            - name: Set up Docker Buildx
              uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

            - name: Build image
              id: docker_build
              uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
              with:
                  push: false

            - name: Echo image digest
              run: echo ${{ steps.docker_build.outputs.digest }}
```

### Putting out releases

One innovation that GitHub Actions allowed us to

```YAML
name: Autobump

on:
    pull_request:
        types: [closed]

jobs:
    label-version-bump:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: |
            github.event.pull_request.merged
            && (
                contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'bump patch')
                || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'bump minor')
                || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'bump major')
            )
        steps:
            - name: Check out the repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
              with:
                  ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}

            - name: Detect version bump type
              id: bump-type
              run: |
                  BUMP_TYPE=null
                  if [[ $BUMP_PATCH_PRESENT == 'true' ]]; then
                      BUMP_TYPE=patch
                  fi
                  if [[ $BUMP_MINOR_PRESENT == 'true' ]]; then
                      BUMP_TYPE=minor
                  fi
                  if [[ $BUMP_MAJOR_PRESENT == 'true' ]]; then
                      BUMP_TYPE=major
                  fi
                  echo "::set-output name=bump-type::$BUMP_TYPE"
              env:
                  BUMP_PATCH_PRESENT: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'bump patch') }}
                  BUMP_MINOR_PRESENT: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'bump minor') }}
                  BUMP_MAJOR_PRESENT: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'bump major') }}

            - name: Determine new version
              id: new-version
              if: steps.bump-type.outputs.bump-type != 'null'
              run: |
                  OLD_VERSION=$(jq ".version" package.json -r)
                  NEW_VERSION=$(npx semver $OLD_VERSION -i ${{ steps.bump-type.outputs.bump-type }})
                  echo "::set-output name=new-version::$NEW_VERSION"

            - name: Update version in package.json
              if: steps.bump-type.outputs.bump-type != 'null'
              run: |
                  mv package.json package.old.json
                  jq --indent 4 '.version = "${{ steps.new-version.outputs.new-version }}"' package.old.json > package.json
                  rm package.old.json

            - name: Commit bump
              if: steps.bump-type.outputs.bump-type != 'null'
              uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7
              with:
                  branch: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
                  message: 'Bump version to ${{ steps.new-version.outputs.new-version }}'
```

### Fixing typos

Our website is in a GitHub repository: [PostHog/posthog.com](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com).
In fact, this very post is a Markdown file in the repository's `/contents/blog/` directory. Copy in general
is under `/contents/`.  
All that text is being written by humans… And that poses a problem, because humans make mistkes. Sometimes they just mix letters up, which doesn't look great.

That's why we on every pull request commit we try to fix any typos noticed. For that we use the lovely
[`codespell`](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell), in an action looking like this:

```YAML
on:
    - pull_request

jobs:
    spellcheck:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Check out the repository
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Set up Python
              uses: actions/setup-python@v2
              with:
                  python-version: 3.8

            - name: Install codespell with pip
              run: pip install codespell

            - name: Fix typos
              run: codespell ./contents -w

            - name: Push changes
              uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v7
```

### Ensuring quality of pull requests

At PostHog we collectively create lots of PRs daily. And a problem we've seen is that sometimes contributors or
team members – even the best of engineers! – were skipping describing their PR beyond the title. That wasn't good,
because context was lost that way. Perhaps it was really obvious at the time of the PR's creation… but context
on changes in code is not useful just now, it's useful forever, for instance if checking with `git blame` why
a particular change was made months ago.

That's why with a simple workflow we created a bot that points out newly-opened description-less PRs:

```YAML
on:
    pull_request:
        types: [opened]

jobs:
    check-description:
        name: Check that PR has description
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - name: Check if PR is shame-worthy
              id: is-shame-worthy
              run: |
                  FILTERED_BODY=$( sed -r -e '/^(##? )|(- *\[)/d' <<< $RAW_BODY )
                  echo "::debug::Filtered PR body to $FILTERED_BODY"
                  if [[ -z "${FILTERED_BODY//[[:space:]]/}" ]]; then
                      echo "::set-output name=is-shame-worthy::true"
                  else
                      echo "::set-output name=is-shame-worthy::false"
                  fi
              env:
                  RAW_BODY: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}

            - name: Shame if PR has no description
              if: steps.is-shame-worthy.outputs.is-shame-worthy == 'true'
              run: |
                  SHAME_BODY="Hey @${{ github.actor }}! 👋\nThis pull request seems to contain no description. Please add useful context, rationale, and/or any other information that will help make sense of this change now and in the distant Mars-based future."
                  curl -s -u posthog-bot:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} -X POST -d "{ \"body\": \"$SHAME_BODY\" }" "https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments"
```

### Syncing repositories

One last case we'll discuss is syncing one repository's contents from another's. In our case, the situations is that
we have a main product repo: https://github.com/PostHog/posthog. However, some parts of it – enteprise features code –
are non-FOSS, that is their code is not under a free license. We are happy to offer a purely FOSS version of PostHog
though, and we do that with https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-foss, which is just like the main repo,
except with non-free portions removed.

Keeping `posthog-foss` in sync with `posthog` manually would be awful work though. We've automated it so that it's
effortless:


```YAML
on:
    push:
        branches:
            - master

jobs:
    repo-sync:
        name: Sync posthog-foss with posthog
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Sync repositories 1 to 1 - master branch
              if: github.repository == 'PostHog/posthog'
              uses: wei/git-sync@v3
              with:
                  source_repo: 'https://posthog-bot:${{ secrets.POSTHOG_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/posthog/posthog.git'
                  source_branch: 'master'
                  destination_repo: 'https://posthog-bot:${{ secrets.POSTHOG_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/posthog/posthog-foss.git'
                  destination_branch: 'master'
            - name: Check out posthog-foss
              if: github.repository == 'PostHog/posthog'
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

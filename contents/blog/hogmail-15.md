[The Case Against Collaboration](https://paulitaylor.com/2022/05/06/the-case-against-collaboration/) by Paul Taylor, makes some interesting points about the limits of collaboration on creativity:

* Research by MIT found that brainstorming sessions "reduced creativity" because they lead to incremental modifications, rather than radical and potentially superior solutions.

* "A meta-analytic review of over 800 teams indicated that individuals are more likely to generate a higher number of original ideas when they don’t interact with others."

* Collaboration is best used to solve complex problems that require diverse expert opinions.

* At PostHog, we find [successful offsites](https://posthog.com/blog/planning-a-company-offsite) and hackathons are built on preparation. Plan ahead. Set expectations early. Ask people to come up with ideas before the offsite so they have time to think.


[Writing better error messages](https://wix-ux.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons-write-better-error-messages-46c5223e1a2f) by Jenni Nadler, on how Wix changed the way they wrote error messages. Takeaways:

* "Oops! Something went wrong" and similar jovial messages are just annoying and aggravate users. Be clear about exactly what went wrong.

* Offer solutions. If there's a potential way to fix the problem, suggest it. If there isn't, make it easy to get help.

* Fixing bad error messages requires shared responsibility across teams and roles. Wix created a cross-function team just to tackle error handling, and reviews them constantly.

[How has Tesla generated unparalleled operating leverage?](https://aakashgupta.substack.com/p/how-has-tesla-generated-unparalleled) by Aakash Gupta, which looks at how Tesla's success is supported by controlling costs:

* "Most companies spend too much on R&D + SG&A [sales, general & admin]. Tesla doesn’t. As a result, it has unparalleled operating leverage."

* Tesla increased R&D spend in 2021 by 71% by funding R&D through revenue increases alone, holding its total R&D spend at just 5% of revenue. Meta, by comparison, spends 21% of revenue on R&D.

* Thanks in large part to Elon's fame, Tesla doesn't spend much on paid advertising. Most startups don't have an Elon, but focusing on the most cost-effective marketing channels, such as SEO and word-of-mouth, prevents overspending. Tesla is a product-led growth company.

* Tesla went from making 100k cars in 2017 to nearly 1 million in 2021 (a 9x increase), but only increased headcount from 37k to 99k (a 3x increase). Keeping headcount under control lead to a huge increase in margins. This is vital for startups to achieve [default alive status](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html) .

Feature flags, aka feature toggles, turn specific functions on and off during runtime. Rather than maintaining multiple feature branches in your source code, feature flags hide code or behaviors and allow you to enable or disable features on demand and without deploying new code.

[Feature flag benefits](/blog/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) include the ability to:

- **Safely release features** by eliminating complex branching and gradually rolling out feature access, so you can [react quickly if issues arise](https://posthog.com/customers/phantom).

- **Running multivariate tests** so you can understand the impact of new features and changes.

- **Controlling access** to certain features based on user criteria, such as location, device type or subscription level.

In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best open source feature flag tools, all of which are either totally free or offer generous free plans. If you want to run experiments as well, we recommend reading our guide to the [best open-source A/B testing tools](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

> **Changelog:**
> - **Mar 15, 2023:** Removed DevCycle, added Flipt. Updated copy and screenshots.

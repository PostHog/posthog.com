The [benefits of feature flags](/product-engineers/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) are numerous. They help you mitigate risk, [test changes in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production), manage access, and most important of all, ship faster.

While it's tempting to [build your own tools](/blog/feature-flags-as-a-service), there's no shortage to feature flag services with decent free tiers, or open-source feature flag tools you can self-host. These are the best and most popular right now.

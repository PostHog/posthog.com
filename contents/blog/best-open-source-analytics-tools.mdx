<details>
  <summary>What are the criteria for this guide?</summary>

This guide only includes open-source analytics tools that:

1. **Have built-in analysis views.** This includes end-to-end analytics, and dashboarding tools that connect to existing data sources, but not data pipeline platforms.

2. **Are actively maintained.** This is subjectively judged based on recently merged pull requests, commits to their repos, and the responsiveness of the maintainer to review requests.

3. **Are free to self-host.** Tools that are "open core" but don't offer a free, self-hostable deployment option are not included.

</details>  

<details>

### 1. PostHog

![posthog screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/hogflix-dashboard.png)

#### What is PostHog?

- **GitHub Stars:** 24.2k
- **License:** MIT
- **Category:** Product and website analytics
- [PostHog on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog)

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is an all-in-one platform that combines product analytics with several other developer-focused tools, such as web analytics, session replay, feature flags, experiments, error tracking, and surveys.

Beyond the core [product analytics features](/product-analytics), it also supports creating [custom insights using SQL](/docs/product-analytics/sql), and offers a [built-in data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) so you can import data from external sources like Stripe, Hubspot, and Zendesk. 

#### What closed-source tools can it replace?

Several. The built-in product analytics is an [alternative to Mixpanel](/blog/best-mixpanel-alternatives) and [Amplitude](/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives), and it can replace Google Analytics for website and marketing analytics. 

PostHog also offers session replay for both web and mobile apps, so it can replace the likes of [Hotjar](/blog/best-hotjar-alternatives) and [FullStory](/blog/best-fullstory-alternatives), and feature flag and experiment features like those found in [LaunchDarkly](/blog/best-launchdarkly-alternatives).

#### What's included?

[PostHog Open Source](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) is distributed under an MIT license for hobbyists via a Docker Compose deployment. It includes most features, but is limited to one project per instance. 

#### What are the hosting requirements?

The minimum requirements are a Hetzner VM (or equivalent) with 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, and more than 30GB storage.

#### Is there a hosted option?

Yes. PostHog offers a managed cloud option with a [generous free tier](/pricing) of 1 million events, 5,000 recordings, and 1 million flag API requests every month, and the option of US or EU-based hosting.

### 2. Matomo

#### What closed-source tools can it replace?

Metabase is a direct alternative to business intelligence tools like Google's Looker / Looker Studio, Tableau, and Microsoft's Power BI.

This means Plausible doesn't rely on cookies and is compliant with regulations like GDPR out of the box.

- **GitHub Stars:** 3.6k
- **License:** AGPLv3
- **Category:** Product analytics
- [OpenPanel on Github](https://github.com/Openpanel-dev/openpanel)

#### What closed-source tools can it replace?
OpenPanel could replace Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics. It isn't as advanced as any of these tools, but it covers most of the essential features they offer. Unlike PostHog, OpenPanel is focused solely on product analytics, so doesn't include things like session replay or A/B testing features.

#### What's included?
The open-source version is available with no limitations. Features include custom dashboards and charts (line, bar, area, map, pie, funnels, histograms, and retention), user profiles, a realtime analytics view, and tracking scripts for most popular frameworks, including Next.js, React, and React Native.

#### What are the hosting requirements?

OpenPanel doesn't provide minimum requirements, but recommends hosting using Hetzner, and notes it'll work on any server where you have pre-installed Docker, Docker Compose, Node and pnpm.

Google Analytics mainly, but also any other tool focused mainly on website analytics, including closed-source alternatives like Fathom.

#### What's included?

There's no difference between the open source and paid products. Umami tracks all common website metrics, supports custom events, and offers basic funnel, user path, and retention analysis as well.

Umami requires a server with Node.js version 18.18 or newer and an SQL database – MySQL (minimum v8.0) and PostgreSQL (minimum v12.14) are supported.

### 8. Apache Superset
![superset - open source analytics tools](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/superset.png)

- **GitHub Stars:** 64.4k
- **License:** Apache-2.0
- **Category:** Dashboarding and business intelligence
- [Superset on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/superset)

Superset is the third of the big open-source business intelligence tools alongside Metabase and Redash. It's also considered the most complex and least accessible for non-technical users, though its range of visualizations and charting options is unmatched. Superset is ideal for enterprises with experienced in-house data teams, or anyone with lots of SQL experience.

#### What closed-source tools can it replace?

Looker, Tableau and Power BI.

#### What's included?

There's no paid version, so all features are included in the open source release, which includes 40+ pre-installed visualizations and vast options for data scientists to customize them to their needs.

#### What are the hosting requirements?

While there is a Docker Compose deployment, it's not recommended for production use cases, which require deploying Superset on Kubernetes. [Superset's FAQ](https://superset.apache.org/docs/faq/) indicates 8GB RAM and 2vCPUs is "adequate to run a moderately-sized instance".

#### Is there a hosted option?

Not directly, though third-parties offer managed instances.

#### What closed-source tools can it replace?

Tools like Power BI, Looker, and Tableau.

#### What's included?

There is no paid version of Redash, so the open-source release includes everything. There are more than 35 supported data sources and integrations, and a wide range of visualization options, including all common chart types, cohort tables, funnels, pivot tables, and more.

#### What are the hosting requirements?

Redash [documentation](https://redash.io/help/open-source/setup/) suggests a minimum of 4GB of RAM and "reasonable amount of CPU allocation".

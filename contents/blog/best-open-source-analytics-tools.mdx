#### What is PostHog?

- **Created:** 2020
- **License:** MIT
- **GitHub Stars:** 24.2k

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is an all-in-one platform that combines product analytics with several other developer-focused tools, such as web analytics, session replay, feature flags, experiments, error tracking, and surveys.

Beyond the core [product analytics features](/product-analytics), it also supports creating [custom insights using SQL](/docs/product-analytics/sql), and offers a [built-in data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) so you can import data from external sources like Stripe, Hubspot, and Zendesk.

#### Who should use PostHog?

Developers and startups who need an in-depth understanding of what users are doing in their app, or want to track the complete journey from their marketing website through to their app. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing), which means ~90% of users use PostHog for free.

#### FAQ

<details>
    <summary>What tools can PostHog replace?</summary>

Several. The built-in product analytics is an [alternative to Mixpanel](/blog/best-mixpanel-alternatives) and [Amplitude](/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives), and it can replace Google Analytics for website and marketing analytics. 

With heatmaps plus session replay for both web and mobile apps, PostHog can replace the likes of [Hotjar](/blog/best-hotjar-alternatives) and [FullStory](/blog/best-fullstory-alternatives). It even includes feature flag and experiment features like those found in [LaunchDarkly](/blog/best-launchdarkly-alternatives).

</details>

<details>
    <summary>What's included in open source?</summary>

[PostHog Open Source](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) is distributed under an MIT license for hobbyists and proof of concepts via a Docker Compose deployment.

</details>

<details>

Yes. PostHog offers a managed cloud option with a [generous free tier](/pricing) of 1 million events, 5,000 recordings, and 1 million flag API requests every month, and the option of US or EU-based hosting.

[Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset) is the another of the big open-source business intelligence tools alongside Metabase and Redash. It's also considered the most complex and least accessible for non-technical users, though its range of visualizations and charting options is unmatched. Superset is ideal for enterprises with experienced in-house data teams, or anyone with lots of SQL experience.

#### Who should use Apache Superset?

Companies that want to do advanced analysis and have the internal resources and knowledge to use Superset to its full potential. Superset is better-suited to companies with dedicated data science people, whereas Metabase is more accessible to non-technical users.

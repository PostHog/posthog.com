Mobile app analytics tools help you understand how users interact with your app, but the right tool depends on what you're trying to do. Debugging user issues? You'll want session replays. Optimizing conversion funnels? You need retention charts and path analysis. Measuring ad spend? Attribution and ROI tracking are essential.

Some tools try to do it all. Others specialize. Choosing the wrong one means either paying for features you don't need, or stitching together integrations that create a messy workflow.

In this guide, we compare the 7 best mobile app analytics tools – from all-in-one platforms to specialized solutions – so you can find the right fit for your team.

## What features do you need in a mobile app analytics tool?

A good mobile app analytics tool gives you visibility into how users actually experience your app – what they tap, where they drop off, and what keeps them coming back.

Most solid tools include:

- Event tracking for key user actions (sign-ups, purchases, feature usage)
- Funnels and conversion analysis to identify drop-off points
- Retention charts to measure how well you keep users over time
- User segmentation and cohorts for targeted analysis
- Mobile SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter

More advanced tools go further with:

- **Session replay** so you can watch exactly how users navigate your app and where they get stuck
- **Heatmaps and touch tracking** to see which UI elements get the most attention
- **A/B testing and feature flags** to experiment safely and roll out changes incrementally
- **Crash and error monitoring** to connect technical issues to user impact
- **Marketing attribution** to measure which campaigns and channels drive installs and revenue

Here's how some of the most popular mobile app analytics tools compare:

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What is mobile app analytics?</summary>

**Mobile app analytics** is the process of collecting, measuring, and analyzing user behavior data from iOS and Android applications. It helps product teams understand how users interact with their app — from which features get the most engagement to where users drop off in key flows. 

Most mobile analytics platforms track events (like button taps, screen views, and purchases), user properties (like device type, OS version, and location), and session data (like session length and frequency). Advanced platforms also include [session replay](/session-replay), [A/B testing](/ab-testing), and crash analytics to give teams a complete picture of the mobile experience.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between mobile analytics and web analytics?</summary>

While both track user behavior, **mobile analytics** deals with unique challenges that web analytics doesn't face. Mobile apps run on diverse devices with different screen sizes, OS versions, and hardware capabilities. They also work offline, have app store distribution, and use different tracking mechanisms (SDKs vs. JavaScript snippets).

Mobile analytics platforms typically track app-specific metrics like crash-free sessions, app installs, push notification engagement, and gesture interactions (swipes, pinches, rage taps) that don't exist on the web. Some platforms like **PostHog** and **Mixpanel** support both web and mobile, while others like **UXCam** focus exclusively on mobile.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between product analytics and marketing analytics for mobile apps?</summary>

Product analytics focuses on what users do *inside* your app — which features they use, where they get stuck, how often they return, and what drives retention. Tools like **PostHog**, **Mixpanel**, and **Amplitude** excel here. 

Marketing analytics (also called attribution or mobile measurement) focuses on how users *found* your app — which ad campaigns drove installs, what the cost per acquisition was, and which channels have the best ROI. **AppsFlyer** is the leading tool for this. 

Most teams need both: marketing analytics to optimize acquisition spend, and product analytics to understand and improve the in-app experience.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need a mobile measurement partner (MMP) like AppsFlyer?</summary>

You need an MMP if you're running paid user acquisition campaigns and want to know which ads, networks, and creatives are driving installs and conversions. MMPs like **AppsFlyer** handle the complex work of attributing installs to specific campaigns across dozens of ad networks (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.) while navigating iOS privacy restrictions like SKAdNetwork. 

If you're not running paid campaigns or are relying primarily on organic growth, you can skip the MMP and focus on product analytics instead. Many teams use both — an MMP for acquisition data and a product analytics tool like **PostHog** for in-app behavior.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I choose between self-hosted and cloud-hosted analytics?</summary>

Cloud-hosted analytics (like **Mixpanel**, **Amplitude**, or **PostHog** Cloud) is easier to set up and maintain — you just integrate the SDK and start tracking. Self-hosted analytics gives you complete control over your data, which matters for companies in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government) or those with strict data residency requirements. 

**Countly** specializes in self-hosted deployments. The trade-off is that self-hosting requires infrastructure management and ongoing maintenance. For more options, see our guide to the [best GDPR-compliant analytics tools](/blog/best-gdpr-compliant-analytics-tools).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What mobile analytics features should I prioritize?</summary>

It depends on your team's biggest questions:

- **Understanding user flows and drop-offs:** Prioritize [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels), [retention analysis](/docs/product-analytics/retention), and user paths
- **Debugging UX issues:** Look for [session replay for mobile apps](/blog/best-mobile-app-session-replay-tools) with gesture tracking
- **Optimizing features:** Look for [A/B testing](/blog/best-mobile-app-ab-testing-tools) capabilities
- **App stability concerns:** Crash analytics with stack traces is essential

For most teams, starting with core product analytics (events, funnels, retention) and adding session replay provides the best foundation before expanding to more advanced features.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do iOS privacy changes (ATT, SKAdNetwork) affect mobile analytics?</summary>

Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework requires apps to ask permission before tracking users across other apps and websites. Most users opt out, which significantly impacts marketing attribution — you can no longer reliably track which ad drove an install for users who decline. 

SKAdNetwork is Apple's privacy-preserving alternative that provides aggregate attribution data with limited granularity and delayed reporting. Product analytics (tracking behavior within your own app) is less affected since it relies on first-party data. However, cross-app user identification and some cohort analysis capabilities are limited. Tools like **AppsFlyer** and **Mixpanel** have built SKAdNetwork support to help marketers adapt to these restrictions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use multiple analytics tools together?</summary>

Yes, and many teams do. A common setup is using an MMP like **AppsFlyer** for attribution alongside a product analytics tool like **PostHog** or **Mixpanel** for in-app behavior. Some teams add a dedicated crash reporting tool like **Firebase Crashlytics** or [Sentry](/blog/posthog-vs-sentry) on top of their analytics stack. 

The main considerations are SDK bloat (each SDK adds to your app size and can impact performance), data consistency (making sure user IDs match across tools), and cost (paying for multiple platforms). All-in-one platforms like **PostHog** reduce this complexity by combining [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/ab-testing), and [error tracking](/error-tracking) in a single SDK.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the best free mobile analytics tool?</summary>

**Firebase** offers the most generous free tier — its analytics is completely free with no event limits. **PostHog**'s free tier includes 1 million events and 2,500 mobile session recordings per month. **Mixpanel** offers 1 million events per month free, including 20,000 session replays. **Countly** Lite is free and open-source if you self-host, though it lacks advanced features like funnels and retention. For pure marketing attribution, **AppsFlyer**'s Zero plan includes 12,000 lifetime conversions free.

The best choice depends on which features matter most to your team.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Which mobile app analytics tool has the best session replay?</summary>

**PostHog** and **UXCam** both offer strong mobile session replay. **UXCam** is purpose-built for mobile and captures gestures like swipes, pinches, and rage taps with dedicated heatmaps. **PostHog** offers session replay as part of a broader platform that includes analytics, feature flags, and A/B testing — so you can jump from a funnel drop-off directly into the replays that show why users are leaving.

**Mixpanel** added session replay in 2024 with a unique server-side stitching feature that lets you view replays for backend events. **Amplitude** also added replay but it's limited to Growth and Enterprise plans.

For a detailed comparison, see our guide to the [best mobile app session replay tools](/blog/best-mobile-app-session-replay-tools).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is PostHog different from other mobile analytics tools?</summary>

**PostHog** is more than a mobile analytics tool. It gives developers full context by combining all the tools needed to build a successful product in one platform — with a single SDK for mobile.

- **All-in-one toolkit:** [Product analytics](/product-analytics), [web analytics](/web-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [experiments](/experiments), [surveys](/surveys), [error tracking](/error-tracking), [logs](/logs), [workflows](/workflows), and more.
- **Built for mobile:** Native iOS and Android SDKs with offline event queuing, gesture tracking, and mobile session replay
- **Developer-first:** Transparent APIs, [SQL query builder](/docs/product-analytics/sql), open source, and a [public roadmap](/roadmap)
- **Transparent pricing:** Generous free tiers and [usage-based billing](/pricing)
- **Trusted by teams:** Used by [20,000+ companies](/customers) including Y Combinator startups, scale-ups, and enterprises

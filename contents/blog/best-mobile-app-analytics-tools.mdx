- **Web:** <span className="text-red text-lg">âœ–</span>
- **Server:** <span className="text-red text-lg">âœ–</span>

### How much does Firebase cost?

Since Firebase is powered by Google Analytics, it follows the same pricing. It has a generous free tier that's sufficient for most startups. Larger enterprises with higher data collection and export requirements will need to upgrade to GA360, which _starts_ at $50,000 per year. 

A good rule of thumb is that if you're exporting more than 1 million events per day, or querying data with more than 10 million events, you'll need to upgrade to GA360. See Google's [breakdown](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11202874) for more.

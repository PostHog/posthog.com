The four most popular alternatives to Mixpanel are:

1. **[PostHog](#posthog):** An open-source, all-in-one platform that includes analytics, A/B testing, features flags, session replay, and user surveys.
2. **[Google Analytics 4](#google-analytics-4-ga4):** The latest version of Google's analytics platform that now offers more for product teams.
3. **[Amplitude](#amplitude):** Mixpanel's long-time rival and a popular choice among large enterprise customers.
4. **[Heap](#heap):** A mid-market alternative that also offers session replay, and autocaptures events.

In this guide, we explore how they compare to Mixpanel, who uses them, and which is the best Mixpanel alternative depending on your needs.

## PostHog

![posthog](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/posthog-website.png)

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an all-in-one, open-source platform that combines product analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys into one product. It can also replace customer data platforms (CDP), like Segment.
 
### Key features

- üìà **Product analytics**, including funnel insights, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Power users can create custom insights using SQL.

- üì∫ **Session replays** with event timelines, console logs, and network activity. You can also download recordings to save them beyond the standard 90-day retention policy.

- üö© **Feature flags** with local evaluation (for faster performance) and JSON payloads, so you can make changes to your product without deploying new code. 

- üß™ **A/B tests** with up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculates recommended duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- üí¨ **Surveys**, including open text, link with custom CTA, ratings (for NPS and PMF surveys), single and multiple choice. Target users based on user properties, URL, or using existing feature flags.

### Who uses PostHog?

Typical PostHog users are:

- Product-minded engineering teams
- Data-savvy product managers
- Startups and mid-size enterprises

Customers include [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai), [Hasura](/customers/hasura), [Vendasta](/customers/vendasta), and Airbus.

### How does PostHog compare to Mixpanel?

PostHog's built-in features make it the obvious choice if you like the idea of consolidating around one platform. Mixpanel's offers plentiful third-party integrations for features it doesn't have, but this creates a messy workflow for teams. PostHog also supports autocapture. This means you don't have to manually instrument every event you want to track, and PostHog starts collecting data from the moment you implement its tracking snippet.

### How popular is PostHog?

According to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant, _PostHog is the fastest growing Mixpanel alternative_ in the market.

As of Jul 2023, **PostHog** is deployed by 2,365 (0.2%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, up +327% from 554 the previous year. **Mixpanel** is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%), down -17% from 6,295 the previous year.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Mixpanel (product analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (session replay and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow, ensuring they don't overspend. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing), and companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means using funnels to track conversion, watching session replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> ### Bottom line 
>
> PostHog is the best Mixpanel alternative for startups and mid-size companies, especially those who would rather use one integrated platform instead of multiple, more expensive tools. Power user features, like an SQL insight builder and console logs, make it a good choice for engineering-led teams.

## Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

![GA4](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/google-website.png)

### What is Google Analytics 4?

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is a marketing and product analytics tool that's tightly integrated with other Google products, such as Google Ads, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Firebase. 

Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics (GA3), it's event-based. It also introduces new report types, such as conversion funnels and retention tables. This makes it more useful to product teams than before.

### Key features

- ü§ñ **Predictive insights** alert you to trends you may not be aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- üîÅ **Integration with Google tools** means it's easy to analyze your GA4 data elsewhere, such as Google's dashboarding tool, Looker Studio.

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Natural language search** means you can ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather searching existing reports ‚Äì useful for answering quick, one-off queries.

### Who uses GA4?

Typical GA4 users are:
- Marketing and content teams
- Large news and content publishers
- Enterprises who also use BigQuery

Google's huge scale means GA4 is used by both the biggest global corporations to SMBs of every kind. It is ubiquitous.

### How does GA4 compare to Mixpanel?

GA4 and Mixpanel are only superficially similar. They cover the same basics, but GA4 is better-suited to content and marketing teams, while Mixpanel is designed for product teams. 

GA4's lack of group analytics, which enables product teams to analyze how accounts or companies use a product in aggregate, makes it a poor choice for B2B products.

</div>

![GA4](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/GA4.png)

### Why do companies use GA4?

1. **Because it's Google:** It's not an original reason, but it holds true. Using Google Analytics makes a lot of sense for teams who rely on other Google platforms, like Google Ads and BigQuery.

2. **It's powerful and free:** Likewise, Google's scale means GA4 is completely free to most small and medium-sized businesses. This, combined with strong analytical tools and the large ecosystem of GA experts to call upon, makes it a safe choice.

3. **To track marketing ROI:** While GA4 has pivoted toward product analytics, it's still predominantly used by marketing and e-commerce teams to track the ROI on marketing campaigns, and the performance of marketing websites. It's also popular among large content publishers for its scalability and content performance features.

### How popular is GA4?

Despite complaints from many users who preferred GA3, Google Analytics remains the most-used analytics tool in the world by a large margin. 

As of July 2023, [30.5% of the top 1 million websites](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/) run GA4 ‚Äì another 35.7% were still running GA3.

> ### Bottom line
>
> GA4 is the best Mixpanel alternative for marketing teams who want to track ROI on campaigns, and a good option for B2C and e-commerce platforms. Product teams, especially those working on B2B products, should look elsewhere.

## Amplitude

![amplitude](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/amplitude-website.png)

### What is Amplitude?

Amplitude is an analytics and testing tool with a particular focus on large enterprise customers, like Ford, NBCUniversal, and Walmart. 

### Key features

- üìà **Product analytics**, including funnel and retention analysis, user paths, behavioral cohorts, custom dashboards, and more.

- üß™ **A/B testing** with support for JSON payloads, primary, secondary, and counter metrics.

- üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Customer data platform** that combines analytics data with third-party tools for data governance, identify resolution, and data federation.

- ü§ñ **AI insight builder** that generates insights based on natural language requests, like "What is my purchase conversion rate?".

### Who uses Amplitude?

Typical Amplitude users are:

- Non-technical product managers
- Data teams at large enterprises
- Growth engineering and marketing teams

While it offers a limited free tier for startups, high prices are a barrier. As one reviewer [points out](https://www.g2.com/products/amplitude-analytics/reviews/amplitude-analytics-review-7933567): "The high price tag poses a challenge for small businesses, early-stage, and even medium-sized startups."

### How does Amplitude compare to Mixpanel?

On paper, Amplitude and Mixpanel are very similar, but they differ in focus and approach. While both products serve large enterprise customers, Amplitude is more focused on these users. Pricing isn't transparent, for example, while Mixpanel makes a virtue of its transparent, predictable pricing, and a more generous free tier for startups.

### Why do companies use Amplitude?

1. **Reducing load on data teams:** Amplitude is designed to enable non-technical to self-serve analytics, reducing the load on internal data teams at large companies. Amplitude [cites](https://amplitude.com/case-studies/nbc) NBCUniversal as a company that's benefited from its data team spending less time responding to requests for analysis.

2. **Large-scale experimentation:** Unlike Mixpanel, Amplitude offers a built-in experimentation platform sold as an add-on to its analytics. This allows companies to run experiments on users using existing cohorts created in Amplitude.

3. **Resolving data quality:** Companies that use Amplitude, particularly large ones, often migrate from outdated, or self-built, tools that generate poor quality data. Amplitude helps them fix that while also making analytics more accessible.

### How popular is Amplitude?

Amplitude is slightly more popular than Mixpanel according to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant:

Amplitude is deployed by 6,973 (0.7%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023. Mixpanel is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%).

> ### Bottom line
>
> Amplitude is the best Mixpanel alternative for large enterprise companies who want to reduce the load on expensive, overworked data science teams. Startups and mid-size companies might find there are better-value alternatives.

## Heap

![heap](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/heap-website.png)

### What is Heap?

Heap describes itself as a Digital Insights Platform. Unpacking that a bit, it means Heap offers both product analytics and session replay, while also supporting marketing use cases with multitouch attribution.

Heap was [acquired in September 2023](https://contentsquare.com/heap/) by Contentsquare, a marketing and e-commerce analytics firm, and announced plans to integrate the two products. 

### Key features

- ‚úÖ **Event autocapture** is a key differentiator between Heap and Mixpanel. Autocapture means product teams don't have to rely on engineers to instrument all events, and Heap offers a visual editor for teams to tag on-page events for analysis.

- üì∫ **Session replay** and heatmaps augment Heap's analytics features with qualitative insights, though it lacks the debugging tools typical of most replay tools.

- üîÅ **Managed ETL** to data warehouses, so you can export your Heap analytics data into a data warehouse and combine it with data from other sources.

### Who uses Heap?

Typical Heap users are:

- Non-technical product managers
- Marketing and design teams

Heap has an even greater emphasis on non-technical users than all the tools in this list, particularly product managers at mid-size SaaS companies. Heap sells itself as not requiring significant engineering support.

Customers include Amway, Evenbrite, and Freshworks.

### How does Heap compare to Mixpanel?

Heap's built-in session replay, and autocapture support, make it a good Mixpanel alternative for product teams. Autocapture support, a feature it shares with PostHog, means Heap starts collecting data from the moment a new element is deployed, regardless of whether a custom event is configured. 

While Heap has integrations with most third-party tools for things like A/B testing, or marketing automation, Mixpanel has more. To use just one example, Heap offers just two official survey integrations (Appcues and Delighted), while Mixpanel has nine.

Mixpanel also offers a more generous free tier of up to 20 million events, whereas Heap is limited to 10,000 monthly users.

## Honorable mentions

This guide focuses on the most popular Mixpanel alternatives, but these aren't the only ones. Here are some honorable mentions that are worth also worth considering:

- **[Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/)**, which describes itself as a product experience platform, which means it combines analytics with other tools useful for product teams, like in-app guides, user feedback widgets, roadmap planning, and product discovery.  

- **[Kissmetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.io/)**, which is more focused on marketing and e-commerce use cases than Mixpanel. It's worth considering if you want to focus more on channel attribution and revenue tracking, but don't want to use GA4.

- **[Snowplow](https://snowplow.io/)**, a powerful, open-source behavioral data platform. It can replace tools like Mixpanel and Google Analytics, but it's only suitable for companies with well-staffed data science teams. It's mostly used by large enterprises with the resources to self-host and model data internally. 

- **[Countly](https://countly.com/)**, a product analytics tool can be self-hosted, making it useful for companies that need to retain complete control over their first-party data ‚Äì e.g. healthcare. Unlike Snowplow, however, it doesn't require a data science team.

- **[June](https://www.june.so/)**, a more accessible take on product analytics that focuses on automatically generated reports. It's predominantly used by seed stage and Series A B2B SaaS startups.

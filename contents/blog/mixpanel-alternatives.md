## PostHog

IMAGE HERE

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an all-in-one platform that combines product analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys into one product. It can also replace customer data platforms (CDP), like Segment.
 
### Key features

- **Product analytics**, including funnel insights, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Power users can create custom insights using SQL.

- **Session replays** with event timelines, console logs, and network activity. You can also download recordings to save them beyond the standard 90-day retention policy.

- **Feature flags** with local evaluation (for faster performance) and JSON payloads, so you can make changes to your product without deploying new code. 

- **A/B tests** with up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculates recommended duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- **Surveys**, including open text, link with custom CTA, ratings (for NPS and PMF surveys), single and multiple choice. Target users based on user properties, URL, or using existing feature flags. 

### Who uses PostHog?

PostHog is popular among product-minded engineering teams, especially at startups and mid-size enterprises. Unlike most Mixpanel alternatives, it actively courts engineers who want to understand user behavior, as well as product managers.

Customers include [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai), [Hasura](/customers/hasura), [Vendasta](/customers/vendasta), and Airbus.

### Why do companies use PostHog

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Mixpanel (product analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (session replay and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow, ensuring they don't overspend. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing), and companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means using funnels to track conversion, watching session replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

### How popular is PostHog?

PostHog is the fastest Mixpanel alternative in the market, according to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant.

- PostHog is deployed by 2,365 (0.2%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, up +327% from 554 the previous year.

- Mixpanel is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, down -17% from 6,295 the previous year.

### How does PostHog compare to Mixpanel?

PostHog and Mixpanel offer similar product analytics features, but they diverge in a few important ways:

1. **Event autocapture:** Mixpanel doesn't support event autocapture. This means you must manually instrument all your analytics events before collecting any data. PostHog supports both autocapture and custom events, so you get the best of both worlds. [link here to learn more about autocapture]

2. **Google & Facebook ad integrations:** Mixpanel has integrations with Google and Facebook ads, making it easier for marketing teams to track advertising ROI by combining campaign data with user data. PostHog, in contrast, primarily focuses on engineering and product team use cases.

3. **Real user feedback and data in one:** Mixpanel's singular focus on product analytics is somewhat limiting. You need to look elsewhere to see how real users use your product, or gather feedback on what they think. PostHog closes this loop by combining hard data with actionable user feedback.

**Bottom line:** PostHog is the best Mixpanel alternative to startups and mid-size companies, especially if they're stuck using a confusing collection of individual tools.

## Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

[IMAGE]

### What is Google Analytics 4?

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is a marketing and product analytics tool that's tightly integrated with other Google products, such as Google Ads, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Firebase. 

Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics (GA3), it's event-based, and introduces new report types, such as conversion funnels and retention tables. This makes it more useful to product teams than before.

### Key features

- **Predictive insights** alert you to trends you may not be aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- **Integration with Google tools** means it's easy to analyze your GA4 data elsewhere, such as Google's dashboarding tool, Looker Studio.

- **Natural language search** means you can ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather searching existing reports – useful for answering quick, one-off queries.

### Who uses GA4?

Historically, Google Analytics is mostly used by marketing and content teams, but Google is courting more developers and product teams with GA4's event-based tracking. 

Google's huge scale means GA4 is used by both the biggest global corporations to SMBs of every kind. It is ubiquitous.

### Why do companies use GA4?

1. **Because it's Google:** It's not an original reason, but it holds true. Using Google Analytics makes a lot of sense for teams who rely on other Google platforms, like Google Ads and BigQuery.

2. **It's powerful and free:** Likewise, Google's scale means GA4 is completely free to most small and medium-sized businesses. This, combined with strong analytical tools and the large ecosystem of GA experts to call upon, makes it a safe choice.

3. **To track marketing ROI:** While GA4 has pivoted toward product analytics, it's still predominantly used by marketing and e-commerce teams to track the ROI on marketing campaigns, and the performance of marketing websites. It's also popular among large content publishers for its scalability and content performance features.

### How popular is GA4?

Despite complaints from many users who preferred GA3, Google Analytics remains the most-used analytics tool in the world by a large margin. 

As of July 2023, [30.5% of the top 1 million websites](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/) run GA4 – another 35.7% were still running GA3.

### How does GA4 compare to Mixpanel?

1. **Mixpanel is built for product teams:** Despite Google's overtures, GA4 still skews towards marketing and e-commerce use cases. Mixpanel is built for product teams and includes some useful collaboration features to support them.

2. **GA4 is harder to use:** Mixpanel reviewers appreciate its easy-to-use UI. GA4, in contrast, has faced criticism for its complexity. Moving away from popular "pre-baked" reports in favor of more powerful, highly customizable ones has upset existing users.

3. **Mixpanel is platform-agnostic:** While there's nothing stopping you from exporting GA4 data to non-Google platforms, it's mainly designed to play nicely with Google-owned products. Mixpanel happily integrates with a wide range or third-party tools across A/B testing, marketing automation, attribution, and beyond.

**Bottom line:** GA4 is the best Mixpanel alternative for marketing teams who want to track ROI on campaigns.

## Amplitude

IMAGE

### What is Amplitude?

Amplitude is an analytics and testing tool with a particular focus on large enterprise customers, like Ford, NBCUniversal, and Walmart. 

### Key features

- **Product analytics**, including funnel and retention analysis, user paths, behavioral cohorts, custom dashboards, and more.

- **A/B testing** with support for JSON payloads, primary, secondary, and counter metrics.

- **Customer data platform** that combines analytics data with third-party tools for data governance, identify resolution, and data federation.

- **AI insight builder** that generates insights based on natural language requests, like "What is my purchase conversion rate?".

### Who uses Amplitude?

Amplitude skews toward non-technical users, like product managers and designers, over software engineers. Especially those at large, Fortune 500 companies.

While it offers a limited free tier for startups, high prices are a barrier. As one reviewer [points out](https://www.g2.com/products/amplitude-analytics/reviews/amplitude-analytics-review-7933567): "The high price tag poses a challenge for small businesses, early-stage, and even medium-sized startups."

### Why do companies use Amplitude?

1. **Reducing load on data teams:** Amplitude, like most of the tools in this list, is designed to allow non-technical users use analytics independently, reducing the load on internal data teams at large companies. Amplitude [cites](https://amplitude.com/case-studies/nbc) NBCUniversal as a company that's benefited from its data team spending less time responding to requests for analysis.

2. **Analytics and experimentation:** Unlike Mixpanel, Amplitude offers a built-in experimentation platform sold as an add-on to its analytics. This allows companies to run experiments on users using existing cohorts created in Amplitude.

3. **Resolving data quality** WORDS

### How popular is Amplitude?

Amplitude is slightly more popular than Mixpanel according to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant:

Amplitude is deployed by 6,973 (0.7%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023. Mixpanel is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%).

### How does Amplitude compare to Mixpanel?

- **Similar core features:** On a surface level, Amplitude and Mixpanel offer very similar analytics features, but presented in different ways. Mixpanel skews toward a simplified UI that's easier to use.

- **Greater focus on enterprise customers:** While both products serve large enterprise customers, Amplitude is more focused on these users. Pricing isn't transparent, for example, while Mixpanel makes a virtue of its transparent, predictable pricing, and a more generous free tier for startups.

- **Collaboration features:** While both products offer some twist on shareable notebooks, Mixpanel's collaboration features are more mature. Mixpanel chose to [sunset A/B testing and messaging](https://mixpanel.com/blog/why-were-sunsetting-messaging-and-experiments/) features in 2021 to double down on product analytics.

**Bottom line:** Amplitude is the best Mixpanel alternative for large enterprise companies who want to reduce the load on expensive, overworked data science teams. 


## Heap

IMAGE

### What is Heap?

Heap describes itself as a Digital Insights Platform. Unpacking that a bit, it means Heap offers both product analytics and session replay, while also supporting marketing use cases with multitouch attribution.

Heap was acquired in September 2023 by Contentsquare, marketing and e-commerce analytics firm, and announced plans to integrate the two products. 

### Key features

- **Event autocapture** is a key differentiator between Heap and Mixpanel. Autocapture means product teams don't have to rely on engineers to instrument all events, and Heap offers a visual editor for teams to tag on-page events for analysis.

- **Session replay** and heatmaps augment Heap's analytics features with qualitative insights, though it lacks the debugging tools typical of most replay tools.

- **Managed ETL** to data warehouses, so you can export your Heap analytics data into a data warehouse and combine it with data from other sources.

### Who uses Heap?

Heap has an even greater emphasis on non-technical users than all the tools in this list, particularly product managers at mid-size SaaS companies. Heap sells itself as not requiring significant engineering support.

### Why do companies use Heap?

1. **Conversion rate optimization:** Combining product analytics and session replay makes Heap especially useful for growth and marketing teams looking to improve conversion.

2. **To improve data collection** Heap's autocapture support can plug gaps in data collection, especially for companies with limited engineering support.

3. **Low information density** Reviewers appreciate Heap's user-friendly interface, which tends toward lower information density than competing tools.

### How popular is Heap?

Heap is less popular than Mixpanel. Heap is deployed on 3,200 (0.3%) of the top 1 million websites, while Mixpanel is used by 5,218. 

### How does Heap compare to Mixpanel?

- **Fewer collaboration features:** Heap lacks collaboration features, like free form notebooks, that are core features in Mixpanel. 

- **Historical data:** Autocapture support means Heap starts collecting data from the moment a new element is deployed, regardless of whether a custom event is configured. It gives Heap an edge in ensuring users can always find data on user behavior, even if it wasn't anticipated.

- **Fewer integrations:** While Heap has integrations with most third-party tools for things like A/B testing, or marketing automation, Mixpanel has more. To use just one example, Heap offers just two official survey integrations (Appcues and Delighted), while Mixpanel has nine. 

**Bottom line:** Heap is the best Mixpanel alternative for non-technical product teams with understaffed engineering teams.

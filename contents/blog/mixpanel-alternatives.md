### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an all-in-one platform that combines product analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and surveys into one product. It can also replace customer data platforms (CDP), such as Segment.
 
### Key features

- **Product analytics**, including funnel insights, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Power users can create custom insights using SQL.

- **Session replays** with event timelines, console logs, and network activity. You can also download recordings to save them beyond the standard 90-day retention policy.

- **Feature flags** with local evaluation (for faster performance) and JSON payloads, so you can make changes to your product without deploying new code. 

- **A/B tests** with up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculates recommended duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- **Surveys**, including open text, link with custom CTA, ratings (for NPS and PMF surveys), single and multiple choice. Target users based on user properties, URL, or using existing feature flags. 

### How popular is PostHog?

According to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent consultant:

- PostHog is deployed by 2,365 (0.2%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, up +327% from 554 the previous year. It's the fastest growing product analytics tool on the market.

- Mixpanel is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, down -17% from 6,295 the previous year.

Data correct as of July 2023.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2.com](https://www.g2.com/products/mixpanel/reviews), [summarized by Senja](https://senja.io/tools/review-mining/share?s=NOmOO5mS), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Mixpanel (product analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (session replay and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow, ensuring they don't overspend. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing), and companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need to understand their users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means using funnels to track conversion, watching session replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

### How does PostHog compare to Mixpanel?

Posthog and Mixpanel offer similar product analytics features, but they diverge in a few important ways:

- **All-in-one vs Integrations:** PostHog integrates features like session replay, A/B testing and feature flags into the platform, whereas Mixpanel relies on an extensive list of third-party integrations. The latter provides more freedom, but PostHog's approach is simpler (and cheaper) to implement.

- **Support for autocapture:** Mixpanel doesn't support event autocapture. This means you must manually instrument all your analytics events before collecting any data. PostHog supports both autocapture and custom events.

- **Marketing uses cases:** Mixpanel has integrations with Google and Facebook ads, making it easier to track advertising ROI by combining campaign data with user data. PostHog, in contrast, primarily focuses on engineering and product team use cases.

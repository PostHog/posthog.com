### How popular is PostHog?

PostHog is the fastest Mixpanel alternative in the market, according to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant.

**PostHog** is deployed by 2,365 (0.2%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, up +327% from 554 the previous year. **Mixpanel** is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%), down -17% from 6,295 the previous year.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Mixpanel (product analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (session replay and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow, ensuring they don't overspend. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing), and companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means using funnels to track conversion, watching session replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> ### Bottom line 
>
> PostHog is the best Mixpanel alternative for startups and mid-size companies, especially if they're stuck using a confusing collection of individual tools. It's also the only tool designed for engineers.

## Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

![GA4](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/google-website.png)

### What is Google Analytics 4?

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is a marketing and product analytics tool that's tightly integrated with other Google products, such as Google Ads, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Firebase. 

Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics (GA3), it's event-based. It also introduces new report types, such as conversion funnels and retention tables. This makes it more useful to product teams than before.

### Key features

- ü§ñ **Predictive insights** alert you to trends you may not be aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- üîÅ **Integration with Google tools** means it's easy to analyze your GA4 data elsewhere, such as Google's dashboarding tool, Looker Studio.

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Natural language search** means you can ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather searching existing reports ‚Äì useful for answering quick, one-off queries.

### Who uses GA4?

Typical GA4 users are:
- Marketing and content teams
- Large news and content publishers
- Enterprises who also use BigQuery

Google's huge scale means GA4 is used by both the biggest global corporations to SMBs of every kind. It is ubiquitous.

![GA4](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/GA4.png)

### Why do companies use GA4?

1. **Because it's Google:** It's not an original reason, but it holds true. Using Google Analytics makes a lot of sense for teams who rely on other Google platforms, like Google Ads and BigQuery.

2. **It's powerful and free:** Likewise, Google's scale means GA4 is completely free to most small and medium-sized businesses. This, combined with strong analytical tools and the large ecosystem of GA experts to call upon, makes it a safe choice.

3. **To track marketing ROI:** While GA4 has pivoted toward product analytics, it's still predominantly used by marketing and e-commerce teams to track the ROI on marketing campaigns, and the performance of marketing websites. It's also popular among large content publishers for its scalability and content performance features.

### How popular is GA4?

Despite complaints from many users who preferred GA3, Google Analytics remains the most-used analytics tool in the world by a large margin. 

As of July 2023, [30.5% of the top 1 million websites](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/) run GA4 ‚Äì another 35.7% were still running GA3.

### How does GA4 compare to Mixpanel?

1. **Mixpanel is built for product teams:** Despite Google's overtures, GA4 still skews towards marketing and e-commerce use cases. Mixpanel is built for product teams and includes some useful collaboration features to support them.

2. **GA4 is harder to use:** Mixpanel reviewers appreciate its easy-to-use UI. GA4, in contrast, has faced criticism for its complexity. Moving away from popular "pre-baked" reports in favor of more powerful, highly customizable ones has upset existing users.

3. **Mixpanel is platform-agnostic:** While there's nothing stopping you from exporting GA4 data to non-Google platforms, it's mainly designed to play nicely with Google-owned products. Mixpanel happily integrates with a wide range or third-party tools across A/B testing, marketing automation, attribution, and beyond.

> ### Bottom line
>
> GA4 is the best Mixpanel alternative for marketing teams who want to track ROI on campaigns.

## Amplitude

![amplitude](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/amplitude-website.png)

### What is Amplitude?

Amplitude is an analytics and testing tool with a particular focus on large enterprise customers, like Ford, NBCUniversal, and Walmart. 

### Key features

- üìà **Product analytics**, including funnel and retention analysis, user paths, behavioral cohorts, custom dashboards, and more.

- üß™ **A/B testing** with support for JSON payloads, primary, secondary, and counter metrics.

- üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Customer data platform** that combines analytics data with third-party tools for data governance, identify resolution, and data federation.

- ü§ñ **AI insight builder** that generates insights based on natural language requests, like "What is my purchase conversion rate?".

### Who uses Amplitude?

Typical Amplitude users are:

- Non-technical product managers
- Data teams at large enterprises
- Growth engineering and marketing teams

While it offers a limited free tier for startups, high prices are a barrier. As one reviewer [points out](https://www.g2.com/products/amplitude-analytics/reviews/amplitude-analytics-review-7933567): "The high price tag poses a challenge for small businesses, early-stage, and even medium-sized startups."

![amplitude](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/ammplitude.png)

### Why do companies use Amplitude?

1. **Reducing load on data teams:** Amplitude, like most of the tools in this list, is designed to allow non-technical users use analytics independently, reducing the load on internal data teams at large companies. Amplitude [cites](https://amplitude.com/case-studies/nbc) NBCUniversal as a company that's benefited from its data team spending less time responding to requests for analysis.

2. **Analytics and experimentation:** Unlike Mixpanel, Amplitude offers a built-in experimentation platform sold as an add-on to its analytics. This allows companies to run experiments on users using existing cohorts created in Amplitude.

3. **Resolving data quality** WORDS

### How popular is Amplitude?

Amplitude is slightly more popular than Mixpanel according to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant:

Amplitude is deployed by 6,973 (0.7%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023. Mixpanel is deployed by 5,218 (0.5%).

### How does Amplitude compare to Mixpanel?

- **Similar core features:** On a surface level, Amplitude and Mixpanel offer very similar analytics features, but presented in different ways. Mixpanel skews toward a simplified UI that's easier to use.

- **Greater focus on enterprise customers:** While both products serve large enterprise customers, Amplitude is more focused on these users. Pricing isn't transparent, for example, while Mixpanel makes a virtue of its transparent, predictable pricing, and a more generous free tier for startups.

- **Collaboration features:** While both products offer some twist on shareable notebooks, Mixpanel's collaboration features are more mature. Mixpanel chose to [sunset A/B testing and messaging](https://mixpanel.com/blog/why-were-sunsetting-messaging-and-experiments/) features in 2021 to double down on product analytics.

> ### Bottom line
>
> Amplitude is the best Mixpanel alternative for large enterprise companies who want to reduce the load on expensive, overworked data science teams.

## Heap

![heap](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/heap-website.png)

### What is Heap?

Heap describes itself as a Digital Insights Platform. Unpacking that a bit, it means Heap offers both product analytics and session replay, while also supporting marketing use cases with multitouch attribution.

Heap was acquired in September 2023 by Contentsquare, marketing and e-commerce analytics firm, and announced plans to integrate the two products. 

### Key features

- ‚úÖ **Event autocapture** is a key differentiator between Heap and Mixpanel. Autocapture means product teams don't have to rely on engineers to instrument all events, and Heap offers a visual editor for teams to tag on-page events for analysis.

- üì∫ **Session replay** and heatmaps augment Heap's analytics features with qualitative insights, though it lacks the debugging tools typical of most replay tools.

- üîÅ **Managed ETL** to data warehouses, so you can export your Heap analytics data into a data warehouse and combine it with data from other sources.

### Who uses Heap?

Typical Heap users are:

- Non-technical product managers
- Marketing and design teams

Heap has an even greater emphasis on non-technical users than all the tools in this list, particularly product managers at mid-size SaaS companies. Heap sells itself as not requiring significant engineering support.

Customers include Amway, Evenbrite, and Freshworks.

![heap](../images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/heap.png)

### Why do companies use Heap?

1. **Conversion rate optimization:** Combining product analytics and session replay makes Heap especially useful for growth and marketing teams looking to improve conversion.

2. **To improve data collection** Heap's autocapture support can plug gaps in data collection, especially for companies with limited engineering support.

3. **Low information density** Reviewers appreciate Heap's user-friendly interface, which tends toward lower information density than competing tools.

### How popular is Heap?

Heap is less popular than Mixpanel. Heap is deployed on 3,200 (0.3%) of the top 1 million websites, while Mixpanel is used by 5,218. 

### How does Heap compare to Mixpanel?

- **Fewer collaboration features:** Heap lacks collaboration features, like free form notebooks, that are core features in Mixpanel. 

- **Historical data:** Autocapture support means Heap starts collecting data from the moment a new element is deployed, regardless of whether a custom event is configured. It gives Heap an edge in ensuring users can always find data on user behavior, even if it wasn't anticipated.

- **Fewer integrations:** While Heap has integrations with most third-party tools for things like A/B testing, or marketing automation, Mixpanel has more. To use just one example, Heap offers just two official survey integrations (Appcues and Delighted), while Mixpanel has nine. 

> ### Bottom line 
>
> Heap is the best Mixpanel alternative for non-technical product teams with understaffed engineering teams.

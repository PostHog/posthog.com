[Kyle Poyar on what SaaS companies can learn from the New York Times](https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/the-gist-a-simple-way-to-boost-conversion) it's all about usage paywalls:

- Kyle highlights how usage limits like The Times' original 20 article per month limit are increasingly effective for PLG companies. He cites Zoom (40 min limit) and Miro (3 editable boards) as examples of effective "free-to-paid" models.
 
- Usage paywalls can also be used to increase revenue among heavy users, or incentivize changes in behavior. Users who pay SurveyMonkey monthly have a monthly cap; annual plans have an annual cap, giving those users more flexibility and making annual plans more attractive.
 
- Key point: usage limits allow companies to make their product "affordable for new customers while still expanding existing customers with high switching costs."

[Why canâ€™t we all just get along?](https://emilywebber.co.uk/why-cant-we-all-just-get-along/) is a thoughtful challenge on how silos develop through a bias to specific specializations:

- Companies that call themselves engineering, data, or product-led tend to generate their own unique anti-patterns, such as building things "at the expense of why" or silos where product managers make all the decisions.
 
- An important way to avoid this is to recognize "disciplines and specialisms are not the same as roles". Roles overlap and this makes for better collaboration and outcomes.
 
- Go beyond T-shaped people and look for [broken comb people](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/06/27/broken-comb-people/) â€“ i.e. people who go deep in two or three areas, but also have shallow skills in a few others.

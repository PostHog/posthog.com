Like everyone else, our AI journey started with a chatbot. From the first “you're absolutely right!” it crawled, then walked, then became a lanky teenager with confidently wrong opinions.

Our beloved hedgehog, Max, was the face that greeted you at every AI interaction. It kept learning, and eventually grew into a very capable product assistant. We learned a lot about [building AI-powered features](/newsletter/building-ai-features) along the way. 

**The problem:** Even as we sprinkled contextual AI across the product, the whole concept of PostHog AI got mentally filed under “the chat.” 

We didn't want to be another company with [hand-wavey marketing](https://posthog.com/newsletter/marketing-for-devs) like “it's not just a chat bot, it's… [insert amazing AI capability here]”, which meant we needed to rethink how we positioned our AI capabilities in the minds of our users.  

### The assistant becomes the architect 
Lots of beta users loved Max, but a comparison that kept coming up internally was Clippy; a paperclip animated assistant from Microsoft Office in the late 90’s, known for its intrusive, and unhelpful pop-ups (It was widely disliked and was removed in Office 2007).

_Clippy was ahead of its time. Prove me wrong._

Clippy was the Kool-Aid Man busting through your wall; Max AI was opt-in and useful, but still it's instructive. Assistants don’t work when they’re a novelty UI. Whether or not users think it’s a novelty UI is something you have to take ownership of, especially if you're building an AI-native product. 
Deciding how to address this was a hot topic at PostHog. A single Slack thread blew up with over 90 comments! The discussion was pretty intense, hitting on all the key angles from engineering to marketing. Did the mascot add to the user experience, or did it doom perception of PostHog AI as [‘just a chatbot'](/blog/ai-community-answers).

In the end, we decided to axe Max. Not because we hate joy (we like it so much we [risked tanking our conversion rate](/blog/why-os)). We did it because the mascot was a limiting factor.

Max AI became PostHog AI. Not just a character that lives in one corner, but the underlying architecture of PostHog product intelligence (sorry for sneaking a ‘not just’ statement in there).

_Don’t worry, we asked Max if he was ok with it._

### How we built an AI platform (not just AI features)
Long before this pivot, and as it was happening, the real work of improving PostHog AI was happening deep within PostHog. Our AI team was building a shared infrastructure with the same philosophy as [HogQL](/docs/sql): a single system for each small team to extend.

Without it: 
- fragmented experience
- duplicated effort
- maintenance nightmare
- Teams stuck building simple features from scratch instead of advanced stuff by default

With it: 
- shared agent system any product can extend
- reusable components that work everywhere
- consistent UX patterns
- platform-level improvements that benefit everyone automatically

### Why our AI got noticeably better since beta
Overhauling the guts was a good move. It enables deterministic tool‑calling, tighter context packing, and mode‑specific reasoning. 

Translation: fewer “sorry I can’t do that yet” moments, faster replies, cheaper inference. 

Key differences from older architectures:
- **No hallucination**: The agent checks read_taxonomy before assuming event names exist
- **Full visibility**: All tool calls are visible to the agent throughout the conversation
- **Maintained context**: The agent remembers every decision it made and can build on them
- **Explainable**: Chain-of-thought is visible and easy for you to investigate
- **MCP integration**: Everything the agent can do is exposed via the [Model Context Protocol]

### What PostHog AI does now (and why it’s not fake‑smart)
PostHog AI lives inside your product data. It already knows your events, properties, funnels, experiments, and cohorts. You don’t have to teach it what “activation” or “upgrade” means — it sees your taxonomy and uses the same API layer as trends, funnels, and experiments.

When you type something into the chat window, PostHog AI analyzes your request, determines which specialized "modes" it needs to activate, and dynamically loads the appropriate tools and expertise. 

For example, if you ask PostHog AI to "create a funnel tracking the signup flow," it might:

1. Use the read_taxonomy tool to check which events actually exist
2. Switch to Analytics mode to access insight creation tools
3. Switch to SQL mode if you need custom transformations
4. Switch to CDP mode if you want to set up a destination based on the funnel results

### How this changes who can use PostHog
As a company, we’re well known for our [ICP discipline](/newsletter/ideal-customer-profile-framework) Knowing who you’re building for is important — it keeps teams focused, docs clean, and marketing honest. But as PostHog AI matures, we need to keep an eye on the expanding circle.

Tools like Cursor, Replit, and automation platforms such as Make or n8n are built with technical users in mind. Yet their intuitive interfaces also draw in less technical users — people who might not code every day but still have real [problems to solve](/newsletter/how-to-uncover-your-users-real-problems) and [workflows to automate](/blog/workflows-alpha).

With PostHog AI, almost everything you can do in the UI is now doable in natural language:

- **Search and filter**: Find insights, filter session recordings, search documentation
- **Create and modify**: Build dashboards, create insights, set up surveys
- **Write SQL**: Generate and debug HogQL queries for custom analysis
- **Learn PostHog**: Ask how features work, get recommendations on best practices, understand terminology

**The result**: product teams that used to rely on one “PostHog expert” can now self‑serve. Engineers can delegate data questions, PMs can query funnels directly, and analysts can move faster instead of acting as human middleware.

_A common piece of feedback we heard during user interviews was that PostHog AI made adoption of PostHog easier for less technical team members._ 

### Build systems, not sidekicks
Does that mean we’re building a product analytics platform for everyone now? Absolutely not. The point is that AI makes product engineers even more powerful — while also making PostHog accessible to the people they work with. 

And that’s the bigger lesson for anyone building AI products: the goal isn’t to make your product more chatty, it’s to make it more useful by more people, without losing power.

For us, that meant letting go of Max so we could double down on PostHog AI as an architecture that can think, act, and improve across every surface of the product. 

Not everyone will love that call:

>We absolutely loved the name Max and still refer to it as that internally. The new name, PostHog AI, feels very bland and not at all in the playful, original style that makes PostHog unique. We miss the personality and charm that Max brought to the experience.

But most people won’t care, so long as the tool makes their workflow better:

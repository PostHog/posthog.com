In my career so far (admittedly not _that_ long, though no one mistakes me for a college kid any longer, womp womp) I've done a little bit of a _lot_ of different things. In some rough order I've moderated forums, led customer success, created marketing plans and SEO strategies, built websites and apps, led product at a seed-to-series-A co, coded + ran my own startup, and more. I'm currently a product engineer here at PostHog working on the Growth Team. 

Maybe it's just me, but I've had more fun as a product engineer than in _any_ other role, hands down. I'll tell you why.

## Optimizing for fun

But first - why does it matter how much fun I'm having? For me, it's simple. I've been at this whole work thing long enough now to happily realize that the amount of fun I have in my work is highly correlated with my job satisfaction. It sounds obvious - if you're not having fun, would you be satisfied with your job? But I've seen a lot of people sacrifice the fun they have for some _thing_ that gives them more money, status, or even just more of a feeling that they've climbed up the next rung of the ladder despite the fact that they aren't quite sure where the ladder is going.

The problem is that without the fun in the job you lose your daily drive to do the work. When we do things that we experience as being "fun" our neurons are releasing dopamine and activating the parts of the brain that scientists call pleasure centers [[1]](https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2016/summer/neuroscience-of-fun/). When we find activities that activate these pleasure centers, our brains want us to do them again and again. In a work context, this has a couple interesting ramifications:

1) If we're having fun (and releasing dopamine) while doing our work, we'll not only be okay with doing our work on the daily, we will actively look forward to and pursue it.
2) When we do things again and again, we tend to get better at them, and thus better at our jobs.

And when you put these two things together, you'll likely find that optimizing for fun in your work results in you wanting to work more and being better at the work you do, which _should_ (hopefully, theoretically) result in the salary increases and promotions that you've been dreaming about all along.

## What makes a job fun?

This will, admittedly, be different for everyone. But I will say that I'm specifically _not_ talking about an office that has a ping pong table or that organizes amazing off-sites for its remote workforce. While those things are great, what I'm talking about is _the actual work_. The things you do for your job that, hopefully, move the company in some direction.

I have found that the critical ingredients for a fun job, for me, boil down to the following:

1. Challenging problems to solve
2. Support from other highly motivated colleagues
3. The ability to make _important_ decisions
4. Complete transparency into why my work matters

Many companies and roles assume that the first item is the only requirement for a satisfying (aka fun) job. But when you look into the [neuroscience of fun](https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2016/summer/neuroscience-of-fun/), it's clear that being with others (#2) and defining direction and guardrails (#3) (with help and context from superiors [#4]) are critical aspects of any fun activity. 

## So what makes product engineering so fun?

We've written before about [what product engineering is](/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer), so I won't bore you with the details here. TL;DR: A product engineer is someone who works with customers and data to decide what should be built, and then goes and builds it themselves. 

Critically, you can't do the work of a product engineer without the 4 essential ingredients mentioned above. But interestingly, you can _also_ find those ingredients for fun in other roles. 

So what makes product engineering more fun than those other roles? In my opinion, it comes down to the _intensity_ of each ingredient.

Let's look at two other roles, specifically two that have been combined to create the Product Engineer: Product Management and Software Engineering.

### How fun is Product Management?

From first-hand experience, pretty darn fun. We can use our ingredients above and rate the intensity of each to come up with a proxy for fun-ness. Since company culture is so important to #4 (complete transparency into why my work matters), we'll leave it out of our ranking system as it has more to do with the company and less to do with the role. The others are obviously very impacted by culture as well, but we'll assume our roles here are at a company that doesn't completely suck.

1. Challenging problems to solve - 4/5
  - PMs often need to solve challenging problems around UX, customer needs, scheduling, and politics. The cycle can be slow and frustrating at times, though.
2. Support from other highly motivated colleagues - 3/5
  - Product management is often cited as being an extremely lonely role (and in my experience this is true). You're often the only one in your role on your team, you are constantly fighting battles for budget and prioritization by yourself, and if anything goes wrong with your product launch, the buck stops with you. 
3. The ability to make _important_ decisions - 5/5
  - This is simply what PMs are there for. Take the given context, decide what to do with it.

Adding this up we get a score of 12/15. Not bad!

### How fun is Software Engineering? 

1. Challenging problems to solve - 5/5
  - There is nothing like the dopamine rush you get when you've been working through a problem and you finally get it to work. As a software engineer, this happens usually multiple times per day. 
2. Support from other highly motivated colleagues - 5/5
  - Software engineers typically work on a team with at least one other engineer. This team aspect is critical to feeling supported.
3. The ability to make _important_ decisions - 3/5 (or even 2/5)
  - While engineers can make important decisions about how something is implemented, they're often completely out of touch with making important decisions about the business. Oftentimes this is because they don't have the context, and they are simply told what to build. 

For Software Engineering we get a score of 12 or 13/15. Also not bad.

### How fun is Product Engineering? 

1. Challenging problems to solve - 5/5
  - You get the dopamine rush associated with coding, plus the UX problems to solve.
2. Support from other highly motivated colleagues - 5/5
  - Similar to software engineering, you often work on a team with other product engineers.
3. The ability to make _important_ decisions - 5/5
  - Because you're responsible for working with customers and data to decide what gets built, you're inherently making important decisions, similar to product management.

For Product Engineering we get a score of 15/15. Yes I made this scale up, and yes I've given Product Engineering a perfect score. But you did read the title of this blog post, didn't you? I'm _obviously_ biased.

## So what's the catch?

Ah, there is a catch. There is no perfect score for fun without any downsides. There's a concept of a "fun hangover" in children where they have _such_ a fun day that you know the next day is going to be a complete terror. While slightly different in adults, I'm convinced this concept still applies.

The catch is this:

It's really hard to operate simultaneously in both a product and an engineering mindset. The former is an external mindset, and the latter is an internal mindset. Switching between the two takes effort and it's easy to get stuck in one or the other. You have to be very conscious about which mindset you are in - and which one is most useful to you and the company right now - and make that mindset work for the job that currently needs to be done. Sometimes you're in the wrong mindset, and the progress you need to make becomes slow.

Regardless, I'll take the need to context switch. Because after all, I'm optimizing for _fun_.

Since starting PostHog in 2020, we’ve learned a bunch about what does and doesn’t work when it comes to [marketing to engineers](/dev-marketing-for-startups). Paid ads is a slightly scary area because it is _very_ easy to waste a bunch of money doing stuff that doesn't work. 

In this article, my intention is to share specific, actionable advice for early-stage startups building dev tools in particular. 

I've split this into two sections - general misconceptions and then what we've learned, channel-by-channel. 

## Clearing up some misconceptions

### Paid ads =/= marketing

Paid ads are a _subset_ of marketing. Every time you talk about your product in _any_ kind of context, you are doing marketing. This includes your website, turning up to events, writing content, posting on Twitter, chatting in an external Discord group, creating a YouTube tutorial, etc.

This means taking paid ads seriously, but don't spend all your time here. At PostHog, paid ads take up ~10-20% of our marketing team's time in an everage week. We spend 60%+ on writing. 

### All paid ads are basically the same

Very crudely, your ads will have one of two objectives - _conversion_ or _awareness_. 

Conversion means that you want people to click on your ad and then do something like sign up for your product. You can define conversion how you like - this is just a typical example. Conversion is easy to measure, which is why marketers like it. However, you are generally only _capturing_ demand from people already aware of your product. 

Awareness means you want people to see your ad. Maybe they won't click on it - that's ok. Your objective is to just get the word out so that someone is exposed to your product enough times that at some point they Google 'super cool product' and come sign up. Awareness-based ads are a small part of _creating_ demand. Awareness takes more effort to measure, but is totally possible - see below.  

### Paid ads don't work on developers

Everyone who works at a tech company basically thinks they are immune to ads because they are super smart and have never seen an ad for a new product, clicked on it, and then signed up. Your _quantitative_ attribution data in PostHog or whatever analytics tool you are using will seem to back this up. 

This is why we ask all users where they heard about PostHog whenever they sign up or book a demo. Enough of them say 'ad on Google' or similar that we know paid ads do actually reach a large chunk of users. Especially ones with money. However, you need to take the time to collect and digest this _qualitative_ attribution data in the first place. 

### An agency will solve all your problems

I'm a big fan of hiring an agency if you're a startup - paying $5-10k/mo for a small, outsourced team is way more efficient at this stage than hiring one paid ads specialist. Look in Europe - US agencies can be 2-3x more expensive. We use [Hey](https://www.heydigital.co/) and like them. 

_However,_ I really recommend you get personally familiar with each of the main channels I've listed below first. Working with an agency isn't just set and forget - you need to constantly give feedback, ask questions, and suggest new ideas if you want to get the most out of them. 

I personally like [the Demand Curve program](https://www.demandcurve.com/growth-program) – it helped get us off the ground and means we're much better equipped to give our agency feedback. Outsource the legwork, not your critical thinking. 

## Channel-by-channel tips

### Google Search

### Google Display

### Twitter

### LinkedIn

### Reddit

### Quora

### Product Hunt

### Carbon Ads

### Bing

### Sponsoring newsletters

### A couple we haven't tried yet

Over the next few months, we're planning to try out paid ads on G2 and Stack Overflow. We think G2 will be useful for reaching larger companies who are running more formal processes to replace their tools by trying several options first. Stack Overflow we have heard is (anecdotally) good for general awareness-building, but not conversion. Both are quite expensive but very focused options to consider for dev tools. 

## What next?

- Make sure you're covering [all your marketing bases](/blog/dev-marketing-for-startups).

- Read about [how our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing).

- Check out [PostHog’s Marketing Handbook](/handbook/growth/marketing) – and copy it if you want to!

- Have money? Hire someone who can write content and has a deep understanding of SEO. Do not hire an SEO consultant. Don’t have money? Learn how to SEO good with [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/seo) (chapters 6 and 7 are wayyy less important).

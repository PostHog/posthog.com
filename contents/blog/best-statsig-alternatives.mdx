Replacing Statsig comes down to what you're optimizing for: fast, safe releases; deeper analytics; or no-code web experimentation. Here’s a breakdown of the best Statsig alternatives depending on your team’s needs.

<details>
<summary>Which is the best Statsig alternative for startups?</summary>

**PostHog**: An all-in-one dev tool with product analytics, feature flags, experimentation, session replay, and more with a generous free tier and usage-based pricing. Trusted by over 60% of every Y Combinator batch and top startups like [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs) and [Lovable](/customers/lovable).

### What is PostHog?

PostHog is an open-source, all-in-one developer platform for feature management, A/B testing, product analytics, session replay, user surveys, and more. We also have a [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) to sync and query data from external sources and a [customer data platform (CDP)](/blog/cdp-vs-data-warehouse) to send data to destinations.

By combining all these tools into one platform, PostHog eliminates the need for stitching together integrations between third-party tools, and makes it easier for engineers to work with data. PostHog is popular with engineering-led companies, like AI startup [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs) and [Lovable](/customers/lovable), which use PostHog for both feature flags and analytics.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), PostHog is used by 4,336 (0.43%) of the top 1 million websites, compared to Statsig's 1,705 (0.17%). This difference is [confirmed by Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=posthog,statsig) data (minus Statsig's huge spike after being acquired by OpenAI).

#### Key features

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Experiment in your app with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Auto-calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 🚩 **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Statsig?

Statsig and PostHog are similar in some ways, but have different strengths. 

PostHog offers more powerful product analytics and session replay features, including support for [event autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), writing [custom SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql), and [session replay on mobile apps](/docs/session-replay/mobile). It also supports a handful of feature flag features not available with Statsig and offers user surveys.

Statsig, as its name suggests, is an A/B testing tool first and foremost. While both tools support core testing features, like secondary metrics and multivariate tests, PostHog doesn't offer multi-armed bandit or mutually exclusive experiments.

</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It's many tools in one:** PostHog can replace Statsig (feature flags and A/B testing), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (analytics), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and build better products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

3. **It's easy to get started:** Many users love how PostHog's event autocapture means they can go from implementing its tracking code to ingesting events in just a few minutes. Enabling session replay is equally straightforward, so you can instantly start seeing how people are navigating your app or website.

> #### Bottom line
> 
> PostHog is an ideal Statsig alternative if you're looking for a more powerful analytics tool that can also serve your A/B testing and feature management needs. It also offers a dedicated EU-hosted cloud at no extra cost.

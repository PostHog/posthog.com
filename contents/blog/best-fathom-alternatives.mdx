### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us üëã) is an open source platform combining web analytics, product analytics, session replay, A/B testing, feature flags, and user surveys into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to Fathom but also tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel), [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar).

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of October 2024, 5,330 of the top 1 million websites deploy PostHog. Significantly more than the 1,832 using Fathom.

#### Key features

- üìä **Web analytics:** Monitor your [web traffic](/docs/web-analytics) by automatically capturing and calculating metrics like visitors, pageviews, session duration, and bounce rate. See the sources, entry and exit paths, [channels](/docs/data/channel-type), and more.

- üìà **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for full customization.

- üì∫ **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- üí¨ **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

- üß™ **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

### How does PostHog compare to Fathom?

Fathom focuses entirely on web analytics while PostHog includes web analytics with a whole suite of tools for analyzing and improving your site and app. This means PostHog has a wider feature set while still offering the privacy-prerserving options Fathom prides itself on. PostHog is also open source and provides a generous free tier, neither of which is true of Fathom. 

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Fathom">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Free tier" description="Free forever option, no credit card required" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web analytics" description="Pre-built dashboard of aggregate traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom events" description="Manually capture custom events  wherever they happen" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Custom properties" description="Capture properties like type, date, and more with your events" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Conversions" description="Track conversions towards a goal metric with funnels" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cookieless tracking" description="Option to track without using cookies" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="EU hosting" description="Store your data in the EU for compliance" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="API" description="Query your event data via an API" />
</ComparisonTable>

> üí° **Good to know:** Fathom has a slightly different approach to complying with EU privacy regulations. They do so by:
> 1. Being a Canadian company. The European Commission determined that Canada has an adequate level of data protection.
> 2. Having EU isolation so visitor data is routed and stored on EU servers.
> 3. Having a data processing agreement (DPA) available.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Fathom (web analytics), [Fullstory](/blog/posthog-vs-fullstory) (session replay), and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) (feature flags and A/B testing). This simplifies workflows and ensures product data is all in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever. Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> Because PostHog is free and includes the core web analytics and privacy features of Fathom, it makes an excellent alternative. This is especially true for startups and scaleups looking for a range of tools to help them build a better product.

### Why do companies use Heap?

According to G2 reviews, companies enjoy these three areas of Heap:

1. **Autocapture:** Non-technical users love how easy autocapture makes tracking on their site. Along with the element data included, this provides a huge amount of useful analytics data with little setup.

2. **Simple setup:** It does not take a big technical effort to set Heap up. Users can add a single script and begin collecting data. They then make it easy to visualize that data through user paths, funnels, and session replays.

3. **Streamlining analysis:** By having analytics and session replay data in one place, Heap makes it easy to understand the usage of their app or site. This replaces interviews or user testing and makes the development cycle faster.

> #### Bottom line
> For those looking for product analytics, Heap is a good tool to consider. It does lack the simple web analytics view and some of the compliance features Fathom users might care about though.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect [Fathom](/blog/posthog-vs-fathom) replacement if:

- You want all the tools to help you build a better product (like product analytics, session replay, and A/B testing).
- You value transparency. We're open source and open core.
- You want to try before you buy. We're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing).

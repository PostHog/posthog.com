Every developer has shipped a bug that slipped through tests: no one is perfect. What matters is how quickly you find out, understand the cause, and ship a fix. Enter, error tracking tools.

A good error tracking tool will give you context, not just stack traces: it'll show you what the user did right before the exception, which release it came from, and what else broke as a result.

This guide compares the most popular error tracking tools for developers right now, what features they do and don't offer, and who they're built for, so you can decide which one is right for your needs.

## What features do you need in your error tracking tool?

At a minimum, most good error tracking tools will offer things like:

-   Real-time error capture and grouping
-   Full stack traces, source maps, and contextual metadata
-   Alerts and assignment workflows for triage
-   SDKs for major languages and frameworks
-   Integration with CI/CD, logs, and performance data

The absolute best error tools tend to go a bit further by including things like:

- **Integration with session replay:** Useful for linking session recordings to real user sessions, so you can better understand the context of when an error occurs and debug the steps.

- **Integration with product analytics:** Useful so you can correlate the impact of errors on product usage, conversion, and revenue.

- **Very broad SDK and framework support:** Support for the likes of Next.js, Python, and React are typical among all the tools in this list, but some tools go deeper by offering SDKs for less popular frameworks, and even video game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity.

Here's how some of the most popular error tracking tools compare at a glance:

## What's the best error tracking tool for developers?

### 1. PostHog

PostHog is an all-in-one developer platform that goes beyond error tracking and stack traces by combining [error tracking](/error-tracking), [session replay](/session-replay), [analytics](/product-analytics), and [feature flags](/feature-flags) into one platform. 

Each exception can be linked to the related session replay, user, and feature flag version. You can also view the user's actions, console output, and API calls leading up to the issue, then ship a fix behind a feature flag, test it, and measure the impact in analytics without ever having to switch between tools.

PostHog also [supports autocapture of unhandled exceptions](/docs/error-tracking/capture), [filter by error type](/docs/error-tracking/monitoring), and [set event-based alerts](/docs/error-tracking/alerts) that trigger when specific issues occur, and offers built in [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics) for teams that need to observe and optimize AI products as well.

**Strengths:**

-   Replay-linked debugging
-   Full user and session context
-   Transparent usage-based pricing with configurable caps
-   Unified suite: analytics, feature flags, surveys, experiments, LLM analytics and more

**Community:**

- PostHog is fully open source under the MIT license and actively maintained at https://github.com/PostHog/posthog. 

- The [repository](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) has 29.8k+ stars, 360+ contributors, and sees daily commits from both the core team and community.

- [Most development happens in public](/changelog), including product discussions and roadmap planning.

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="PostHog is best for" type="fyi">

Teams that want an integrated view of errors, user behavior, and product analytics in one place. It's also a great choice for any team that's building AI apps, since you get error tracking and an [LLM observability tool](/blog/best-open-source-llm-observability-tools) inside one platform as well.

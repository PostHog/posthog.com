Every developer has shipped a bug that slipped through tests. What matters isn’t perfection, it’s how quickly you find out, understand the cause, and ship a fix. Great error tracking tools give you context, not just stack traces: they show what the user did right before the exception, which release it came from, and what else broke as a result.

The top error monitoring tools give you this context, and in this guide, we'll compare the best options for developers across open-source options, enterprise suites, and all-in-one platforms.

## What are the features of a great error tracking tool

Before jumping into the list, here are the features we are looking for in each tool:

-   Real-time error capture and grouping
-   Full stack traces, source maps, and contextual metadata
-   Alerts and assignment workflows for triage
-   SDKs for major languages and frameworks
-   Integration with CI/CD, logs, and performance data
-   Clear pricing and scalability
-   Behavioral data context (session replays, user data, or analytics)

### 1. PostHog: Best for contextual debugging and developer control

**TL;DR:** PostHog combines [error tracking](/error-tracking), [session replay](/session-replay), [analytics](/product-analytics), and [feature flags](/feature-flags) in one platform, giving developers full context on every issue.

Each exception can be linked to the related session replay, user, and feature flag version. You can see the user’s actions, console output, and API calls leading up to the issue, then ship a fix behind a feature flag, test it, and measure the impact in analytics.

You can also autocapture unhandled exceptions, filter by error type, and set event-based alerts that trigger when specific issues occur.

**Strengths**

-   Replay-linked debugging
-   Full user and session context
-   Transparent usage-based pricing with configurable caps
-   Unified suite: analytics, feature flags, surveys, experiments, and more

**Best for:** Teams that want an integrated view of errors, user behavior, and product analytics in one place.

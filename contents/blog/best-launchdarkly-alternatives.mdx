### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an open-source platform combining A/B testing, feature flags, product analytics, session replay, and user surveys into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) but also tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) and Hotjar.

Typical PostHog users are engineers and product managers at startups and mid-size companies, particularly B2B companies. Customers include [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai), [Hasura](/customers/hasura), [Vendasta](/customers/vendasta), and Airbus.

### Key features

- 🚩 **Feature flags:** Safely rollout features with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Funnels, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Also supports [SQL insights](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

- 📺 **Session replays:** Including event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

### How does PostHog compare to LaunchDarkly?

### Why do companies use DevCycle?

According to G2, reviewers appreciate DevCycle's:

1. **Pricing:** Unlike other tools listed, DevCycle reviewers praise its fair pricing and say it provides great value.

2. **Simplicity:** DevCycle makes it easy for reviews to get feature flags set up and start improving their feature management process.

3. **Integrations:** The fact that DevCycle integrates with GitHub and Jira helps developer workflow. 

> #### Bottom line
> For developers looking for basic feature flags and experimentation tools, DevCycle is a solid choice. Unfortunately, DevCycle lacks the feature maturity of many of the other options.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect LaunchDarkly replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want more than just A/B testing and flags (we have a full suite of product analytics, session replays, and surveys).
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

Check out [our product pages](/product-analytics) and [read our docs](/docs) to learn more.

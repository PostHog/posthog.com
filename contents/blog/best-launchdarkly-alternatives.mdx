## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect LaunchDarkly replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want more than just A/B testing and flags (we have a full suite of product analytics, session replays, and surveys).
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

Check out [our product pages](/product-analytics) and [read our docs](/docs) to learn more.

    metaDescription: 'Compare the best Rollbar alternatives, including PostHog, Sentry, LogRocket, Datadog, Bugsnag, and Airbrake. Find the right error tracking tool for your team, from open-source to enterprise-grade.'
---

Rollbar is one of the most dependable tools for catching errors in production. It's lightweight, integrates easily with most frameworks, and gives developers real-time visibility into what's breaking.

Developers like Rollbar because it's simple and reliable, but simplicity only gets you so far. As your product grows, so does the need for context, and some of the [best error tracking tools](/blog/best-error-tracking-tools) available today go beyond traditional error reporting by combining debugging context, session replay, and observability in one place. 

In this guide, we'll take a closer look at some of the best Rollbar alternatives, including tools with broader capabilities.

## Best Rollbar alternatives

### 1. PostHog

PostHog is a developer platform that goes far beyond just [error tracking](/error-tracking). It combines [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/experiments), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), [surveys](/surveys), and more, giving developers visibility into what went wrong and why.

Instead of showing only stack traces, PostHog links errors to real user sessions. You can replay the exact actions that caused the issue, see what users did before the crash, and trace frontend behavior back to backend exceptions.

PostHog's [pricing is transparent and usage-based](/pricing), with 1 million events and 5000 replays free each month. More than 90% of companies use it for free!

**Choose PostHog if:** You want to consolidate your stack and stop paying for six different tools.

### 2. Sentry

Sentry is one of the most established names in error tracking; it's mature, reliable, and most developers have used it at some point. 

Known for its precise stack traces, powerful grouping, and strong integrations across frontend and backend frameworks, Sentry also offers performance monitoring, so you can spot slow transactions and bottlenecks alongside exceptions.

Its open-source roots make it transparent, and self-hosting is an option for teams that need full control over their data. For most users, though, the managed Cloud version is easier to run – just expect the bill to climb as you scale.

**Choose Sentry if:** You need a reliable, mature error monitoring tool with broad framework support and rich traces.

### 3. LogRocket

LogRocket also focuses on helping developers and product teams understand what users actually did before an error occurred. It combines session replay, network and console logs, and performance metrics in one interface.

By pairing replay with detailed technical data, LogRocket helps frontend developers reproduce and fix issues faster, without needing to guess or wait for user screenshots. It's especially useful for JavaScript-heavy apps, SPAs, and UX troubleshooting.

LogRocket doesn't cover backend or server-side error tracking, so you'll still need another tool for your API layer.

**Choose LogRocket if:** You're debugging gnarly frontend issues and need to see exactly what users clicked.

### 4. Datadog

Datadog is a full observability platform combining application performance monitoring (APM), logs, metrics, traces, and error tracking. Its Real User Monitoring (RUM) connects frontend sessions with backend traces to show the full blast radius of a crash or slowdown.

While Datadog's depth and integrations are unmatched, its complexity and cost make it more suited to enterprise-scale teams than startups. Still, it does a great job at providing a single pane of glass across infrastructure, application performance, and user behavior.

If you're already using Datadog for metrics or APM, enabling its error tracking and RUM modules can help unify your monitoring stack.

**Choose Datadog if:** You're at enterprise scale and need a single pane of glass across infrastructure, application performance, and user behavior.

### 5. Bugsnag

Bugsnag centers around application stability. It measures crash-free sessions and release health to show how each deployment affects users, and uses a stability score to help you prioritize the most impactful issues first.

The platform's mobile SDKs are excellent, particularly strong for mobile teams that need visibility into release regressions and app performance. Bugsnag supports frontend and backend frameworks too, but its mobile game is where it really shines.

Bugsnag is developer-friendly, but unlike PostHog or Sentry, it doesn't include replay or analytics features; it's laser-focused on stability instead.

**Choose Bugsnag if:** You're a mobile or web team focused on app stability, crash-free sessions, and release health tracking.

### 6. Airbrake

Airbrake is one of the earliest error tracking tools and, similar to Rollbar, remains popular for its simplicity and low overhead. It gives you basic aggregation, trend tracking, and notifications, nothing fancy, nothing confusing.

Setup is quick, SDKs cover most major languages, and the UI focuses on what small teams need most: catching and resolving exceptions fast.

Ok, so you’ve read *Zero to One* and *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, but what are all the boring admin things that are actually going to drain 40% of your time which no one has told you about?

More importantly, what are the tools you can use to streamline and automate these?

**Spoiler alert**: it’s Deel + Gusto + Fondo + Pry + Brex + some free contract templates + Google Sheets/Docs + Workable + Hubspot + Charlie

This article is US-focused, but most of it applies to any country. I won’t offer multiple options here - these are the tools that I have settled on using personally after a bunch of research and trying out different things.

By using these, hopefully I can save you a bunch of time and precious $$$ trying to figure out how to put together contracts, pay people on time, manage your money and comply with laws you are only just finding out exist.

## Paying people

You’re going to be hiring people either as permanent employees or as contractors. You will need the appropriate contract, and a system for automatically paying them. Finding the right solution can be stressful, especially because your team will be relying on you to get this right.

### Permanent employees

I like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a> a lot (US only). They make the process pretty seamless for you and your new hire, offer tantalizing discounts for early stage startups, and integrate things like state tax registrations, healthcare benefits and mandatory insurance quite nicely. Their phone support is great, but avoid email or chat. Gusto charge $39/month plus $6 per employee.

Time suck alert - online state registration laws vary and all of their websites are garbage. Gusto have a ton of useful documentation on this, but bear in mind you will probably spend 3 hours registering in each state the first time you employ someone there. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://agent.middesk.com/">Middesk</a> can handle this for you for $99, but I haven’t used it (yet).

### Contractors

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.letsdeel.com/">Deel</a> is the only way to go. They cover pretty much any country and currency you’ll need, handle all the compliance stuff for you, and generally make the process way more pleasant than it has any right to be. Plus their support is insanely responsive and helpful. It’s probably my favorite ops product. Deel charge $35/month per contractor.

If you need an Employer of Record service, Deel now offer this too - super useful if you are hiring permanent employees outside the US in a country where you don’t have a legal presence.

### Contracts

Orrick have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.orrick.com/en/Total-Access/Tool-Kit/Start-Up-Forms/Employment-and-Consultant">handy free set of templates</a> you can use! (US only)

You need both an Offer Letter and a Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement (US only). The CIIAA means that your employees agree that their work is confidential and whatever they build at work is owned by the company. Not having this = major problems in future, especially for fundraising.

Deel have free templates integrated into their platform already, so you’ll only usually use these for permanent employees, unless you want to use a customized contractor agreement in Deel.

Do not pay a lawyer to create contract templates for you - it is a fantastic waste of money better spent when you need them to handle your next funding round.


## Managing your money (so you can keep paying people)

There are basically two sides to finance - accounting and budgeting. You know this already from YC’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a>, of course. Managing your money can be very stressful, especially as not having it means that everything else you're trying to do becomes kinda irrelevant...

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/o2xbqBmHbQAbm" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/move-donald-trump-o2xbqBmHbQAbm">via GIPHY</a></p>

### Accounting

For your accounting, you'll want to do the bare minimum to be legally compliant and not sued by the IRS; and have financial reports to look at so you can nod and go ‘hm, yes we are still burning money at an alarming rate.’

We use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.tryfondo.com/">Fondo</a> and they are unbelievably good. They become your outsourced finance team, and you submit everything through a shared Slack channel with them or via an online portal, which is remarkably straightforward to use. Fondo will handle your tax returns, annual filing and also send you monthly management reports. They charge on a sliding scale based on your expenses, so I’m not sharing what we pay here for confidentiality reasons.

There is no need to do Xero or QuickBooks yourself - it is not a good use of your time, even if it is cheaper. The exception is if you have a finance background, in which case you can probably manage this yourself just fine (but even then, I’d question if it’s the best thing you could be doing).

### Budgeting/Forecasting

Don’t spend too much time making financial forecasts at an early stage - your priority should be to put together something credible to make sure you don’t run out of money in 3 months. Investors need you to have some idea of what's going on financially, but it's a complete waste of time to pretend you have a detailed view of what will happen.

A relatively new tool called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://pry.co/">Pry</a> has been a game-changer for us. Yes, we all know you can “just” do it in Excel (which you will want to if you have a finance background), but a tool like Pry makes it so much easier. And you can skip the 2 years chained to your desk at Goldman!

Pry connects seamlessly with your accounting software, and you then just fill out assumptions manually or using very simple formulae. Pry also has neat dashboards for visualizing everything, as well as scenario modeling. They currently charge $100/month, though worth asking for a discount if you are a startup...

## Where to put the money

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6ZtpoNGDS4cZ8GWY" width="480" height="338" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-3o6ZtpoNGDS4cZ8GWY">via GIPHY</a></p>

Put it in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a>, obviously (US only). They also make it incredibly easy to manage virtual credit cards, and their built-in expense management negates the need for something like Expensify. They don’t charge you anything.

In Europe, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.revolut.com/">Revolut</a> are about the only digital bank that get anywhere near Brex features-wise, although I find their platform a lot more buggy.

I know what you're thinking - surely there's somewhere I can put my money to get some interest? The reality is that shopping around furiously to find some paltry 0.75% interest rate is highly unlikely to make any difference to your burn rate, and you're better off (in the early days) prioritizing having your cash easily accessible vs. trying to optimize for returns. I am not a financial advisor though - you should talk to one if you decide this is important.

## Ok, but what about…?

Recruitment? Sales? HR? Business planning? You may or may not consider these ops, but for the sake of simplicity I’m throwing them in under ‘anything that is not building the product or talking to customers’.

You can do these perfectly fine in a well-organized Google Doc or Sheet. Just be disciplined and keep it up to date. Once you start spending half a day per week on these things, then you should invest in:

- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.workable.com/">Workable</a> for recruitment. $99 per role per month, pay as you go.
- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> for sales. Various tiers and combos available, starting from free. Free doesn’t mean you should start there though.
- Something like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.charliehr.com/">Charlie</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.hibob.com/">Bob</a> for things like recording salaries, addresses etc.. Around $6 per employee per month usually.

For business planning (setting OKRs etc.), I’m yet to find a tool that genuinely convinces me of its value over a well-organized Google Sheet. The number one challenge I’ve found is effectively communicating and tracking the output of business planning, and people really don’t like having to use another multiple platforms to track what they’re doing.

Congrats, you have hopefully saved a bunch of precious time and mental energy that can now be used on building the product, talking to customers, recruiting and creating (presumably) massive hype on Clubhouse.

As you may have heard, we’ll soon host our first ever meet-up for anyone who uses or is interested in finding out more about PostHog. It’ll take place in London, on February 24th — [we’d love for you to join us](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hosthog-london-2022-tickets-259372428917). 

And if you haven’t RSVPed yet because you’re unsure of something, we’ve got answers to your questions…

## Why are we hosting an event?

We first discussed the idea of meetups last year during [one of our hackathon offsites](/handbook/company/offsites). It’s possible we were inspired by the chance to launch something called _HostHogs_, but from the start we also imagined events would be a great way to learn about building better products with analytics. That’s why we’ve invited Anca Filip, Head of Product at [Mention Me](/customers/mention-me), to join us for a fireside chat — so she can explain how Mention Me, which recently finished a $25M raise, uses PostHog.

## Who are HostHogs for?

HostHogs are for everyone and anyone who wants to build better things. You don’t have to be a PostHog client. Maybe you’ve only just heard of PostHog, or maybe you want to meet the team and find out about working here! Either way, HostHogs are open to you.

## What about Covid-19?

We’re hosting this event in the UK, where the rate of vaccination is high. We’ve also taken steps to ensure this event is as safe as we can make it, such as having hand sanitizer and masks available throughout the event. We’ve also purposefully chosen a venue which is on the larger side, to help ensure there’s room for everyone to maintain a safe distance from each other. 

We won’t be requiring masks or vaccination history to attend a HostHog, but if you’re not comfortable attending then we’ll be writing up an article about the talks afterwards. 

## Is there a dress code or code of conduct?

There’s no dress code, but we will expect everyone to adhere to [our standard code of conduct](/docs/contribute/code-of-conduct). Please help us create a safe, inclusive environment for everyone! 

## I don’t live in London. Where will the next HostHog be?

We definitely plan to host more events in the future, but we don’t yet know when or where they will be. If you’d like to suggest a location, or have any other feedback then just let us know in [the PostHog Slack group](/slack). 

## Do I need to RSVP?

This is a free event with limited capacity, so we very strongly encourage that you RSVP in order to secure your spot. We will do our best to accommodate, but in the event we’re over-attended, we will give priority to those who have RSVPed. 

## Did you say free drinks and pizza?

Yes! The offers a great selection of beers, wines and cocktails, as well as non-alcoholic options and tasty food. We can’t guarantee we can accommodate for any allergies or intolerances, but let us know in [the community Slack](/slack) and we’ll try our best.

## I have another question...

If you have a question which isn’t answered here or in the Eventbrite page, you can either raise an issue on GitHub, email us at hey@posthog.com,  or ask in the community Slack group. We’d be happy to help!

import { ProductComparisonTable } from 'components/ProductComparisonTable'

[Pendo](/blog/posthog-vs-pendo) is a popular product experience platform — and a good one. Its combination of in-app guides, product analytics, feedback collection, and roadmap tools has made it a go-to for product managers looking to drive adoption without engineering support.

But Pendo isn't the right fit for every team. Maybe you need feature flags, A/B testing, or error tracking that Pendo doesn't offer. Maybe you want transparent, usage-based pricing instead of opaque quotes that [average ~$48k/year](https://www.vendr.com/buyer-guides/pendo). Or maybe you're an engineering-led team that wants SQL access, open-source code, and a platform that goes beyond in-app guides.

In this guide, we compare the best Pendo alternatives — from all-in-one platforms that combine analytics with experimentation and developer tools, to focused digital adoption platforms for enterprise onboarding.

## 1. PostHog

-   **Founded:** 2020
-   **Most similar to:** Heap, Pendo, Smartlook
-   **Typical users:** Engineers, product, and growth teams
-   **Typical customers:** Mid-size product-focused B2Bs and startups

![PostHog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/best-pendo-alternatives/posthog.png)

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is a developer platform combining [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [user surveys](/user-surveys), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/ab-testing), [error tracking](/error-tracking), [workflows](/workflows), and more into one environment. This means it's not just an alternative to Pendo, but also tools like [LaunchDarkly](/blog/best-launchdarkly-alternatives) and [Amplitude](/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives).

Typical PostHog users are engineers, founders, and product managers at startups and mid-size companies, particularly B2B companies. Customers include [Supabase](/customers/supabase), [Lovable](/customers/lovable), [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs), and many more.

- **A/B tests:** Up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with local evaluation (for faster performance) and JSON payloads.

### How does PostHog compare to Pendo?

Both PostHog and Pendo are multi-product companies covering many use cases. Pendo focuses on in-app guides and internal tools. PostHog focuses on tools product and engineering teams need like feature flags, error tracking, and A/B testing.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog replaces [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) (analytics), [Statsig](/blog/best-statsig-alternatives) (feature flags and A/B testing), and Pendo (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as their company (and usage) grows. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with [A/B/n tests](/tutorials/abn-testing), and [gathering feedback](/templates/in-app-feedback-survey) with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
>
> For teams looking for all the features of Pendo minus in-app guidance, PostHog makes a great alternative. Being free, self-serve, and open source makes it easy to explore and try out. PostHog is especially good for engineering-focused startups and scale-ups looking for tools for build a great product.

### Why do companies use Smartlook?

According to G2 reviewers, Smartlook users benefit from:

1. **The integration between replays and events:** Smartlook connects event-based analytics and real user sessions. This enables users to dive deeper into user behavior than a single tool provides.

2. **Understanding visitor pain points:** The analytics and visualizations make it easy to understand where users are running into trouble or where crashes happen. Fixing these areas improves user experience and conversion.

3. **Real user monitoring:** See how real users are using your app and monitor the quality of their experiences. Figure out what areas are confusing or not used properly.

> #### Bottom line

**Appcues** is the best choice if product onboarding is your primary focus. It offers a polished no-code builder for tooltips, modals, and checklists. **Whatfix** and **WalkMe** are better for enterprise employee training on internal tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Pendo alternative is best for session replay?</summary>

**PostHog** and **Smartlook** both excel at session replay.

Smartlook is particularly strong for mobile apps with native rendering and crash reports.

**Yes, for most use cases.** PostHog covers product analytics, session replay, surveys, and user feedback. The main gap is in-app guides — Pendo has a visual editor for tooltips, product tours, and onboarding walkthroughs that PostHog doesn't offer. PostHog does include [Surveys](/surveys) for collecting feedback and [Workflows](/workflows) for automated messaging, but if visual in-app guidance is critical, you may need a dedicated tool like Appcues alongside PostHog.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Pendo have feature flags or A/B testing?</summary>

Annotations, filtering all functionality by cohorts, retention table filtering and many, many bugfixes. It's all in this PostHog update.

If you're self hosting and want these features - [update your PostHog](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

Please also update your `posthog-js` version to at least `1.3.4` if you have it installed via NPM. If you're using the snippet, you're good to go!  

## Release notes

### Annotations

![](../images/annotations.png)

Digging through git commits to find out what changed to make the graphs go hay-wire? No more! You can now annotate when something happened (a big release, a bugfix or a launch) and make it super easy for your team-mates to figure out what's going on.

### Cohort filters

Anywhere you can filter, you can now filter on cohorts as well. The first contribution by our newest member of the team, Michael!

### Retention table filtering

We added retention the retention table last week but we're not done with it yet. This week [Kacppian](https://github.com/Kacppian), a fervent contributor, added filtering, which combined with the cohort filtering is very powerful.

We'll be adding more improvements in the next release!

### Many toolbar fixes.

As we talked about last week, we've opened the toolbar for beta access. The toolbar will give you things like heatmaps and stats, right on your own website.

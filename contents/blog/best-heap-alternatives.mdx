[Heap](/blog/posthog-vs-heap) made its name with autocapture – install a snippet, start collecting everything, define events later. It's a powerful approach, especially for teams without dedicated data engineering resources.

But autocapture alone doesn't help you ship better products. Heap doesn't include feature flags, A/B testing, or error tracking, for example; its session replay lacks developer debugging tools, and key features like group analytics require a sales conversation.

If you've outgrown Heap or need more from your analytics stack, this guide compares the best alternatives – whether you want a similar tool or a full platform for building better products.

## 1. PostHog

### How does PostHog compare to Heap?

PostHog is the most direct like-for-like alternative to Heap.

Unlike Mixpanel and Amplitude, PostHog supports event autocapture, which means it starts capturing data from the moment you deploy PostHog's code.

You can also [create and label events using the PostHog toolbar](/tutorials/how-to-capture-events-the-easy-way). This is similar to Heap's visual labeling feature, though it's only supported on web apps.

## 7. Google Analytics 4

-   **Released:** October 2020
-   **Most similar to:** Amplitude
-   **Typical users:** Marketing and content teams
-   **Typical customers:** Commerce websites and large enterprises

![GA4](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/GA4.png)

### What is Google Analytics 4?

[Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) (GA4) is a marketing and product analytics tool that's tightly integrated with other Google products, such as Ads, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Firebase.

- **Predictive insights** alert you to trends you're not aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- **Integration with Google tools** means it's easy to analyze your GA4 data elsewhere, such as Google's dashboarding tool, Looker Studio.

- **Natural language search** means you can ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather searching existing reports.

### How does GA4 compare to Heap?

GA4 supports event autocapture (calling it "enhanced measurement"), but it' less comprehensive than Heap's – covering scrolls, outbound clicks, and file downloads rather than every interaction. The bigger difference is focus: GA4 is a marketing and web analytics tool built around the Google ecosystem, while Heap is a product analytics tool built for understanding in-product user behavior.

<summary>Main differences between GA4 and Heap</summary>

- GA4 is primarily a marketing and web analytics tool with deep Google Ads, BigQuery, and Looker Studio integration; Heap is built for product analytics with a focus on understanding in-product user behavior.
- Heap's autocapture records all interactions and lets you define events retroactively with a visual editor; GA4's autocapture ("enhanced measurement") covers basic interactions like scrolls and outbound clicks but is far less comprehensive.
- GA4 is free for up to 10 million events/month; Heap's free tier is limited to 10,000 sessions.
- Heap offers session replay and heatmaps; GA4 doesn't offer either.
- GA4 includes predictive insights and audience building for ad targeting; Heap doesn't offer advertising or marketing attribution tools.
- Heap supports group analytics for account-level B2B analysis; GA4 doesn't have a native equivalent.

- Both support a form of event autocapture without manual instrumentation.
- Both offer custom dashboards and reporting.

- Both support UTM campaign tracking and traffic source analysis.
- Neither offers feature flags, A/B testing, or surveys natively.

### Why do companies use GA4?

1. **Because it's Google:** It's not an original reason, but it holds true. Using Google Analytics makes a lot of sense for teams who rely on other Google platforms, like [Google Ads](/tutorials/google-ads-reports) and BigQuery.

2. **It's powerful and free:** Likewise, Google's scale means [GA4 is completely free](/blog/google-analytics-cost) to most small and medium-sized businesses. This, combined with strong analytical tools and the large ecosystem of GA experts to call upon, makes it a safe choice.

3. **To track marketing ROI:** GA4 is predominantly used by marketing and e-commerce teams to track campaign ROI. It's also popular among large content publishers for its scalability.

> #### Bottom line
>
> Until recently, Google Analytics wasn't a viable Heap alternative. The launch of GA4 changed this, but switching from Heap to Google only makes sense if you're keen to integrate deeper into Google's ecosystem of data tools, like BigQuery and Looker Studio.

## Which Heap alternative should you choose?

- Want analytics integrated with feature flags, experiments, error tracking, session replays, and more? **PostHog** closes the loop in one platform.
- Need session replay with frustration detection for UX and support teams? **FullStory** leads the charge.
- Retail or financial services team focused on mobile app experience? **Glassbox** is built for that.
- Want analytics plus in-app guides, onboarding flows, and product roadmapping? **Pendo** combines them.
- Looking for mature analytics with experimentation and warehouse-native queries? **Amplitude** skews enterprise.
- Want polished, self-serve product analytics with a strong free tier? **Mixpanel** is a solid pick.
- Heavily invested in Google Ads, BigQuery, and the Google ecosystem? **GA4** is hard to beat for marketing attribution.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Heap replacement if:

-   You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
-   You want to use fewer tools (we can replace way more than just Heap)
-   You want try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary>What is Heap used for?</summary>

**Heap** is a product analytics platform known for comprehensive autocapture. It automatically records clicks, pageviews, form submissions, and other user interactions from the moment you install it, letting you define and analyze events retroactively without engineering support. It also includes session replay and heatmaps, and is now part of **Contentsquare**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why look for Heap alternatives?</summary>

Common reasons include: needing feature flags, A/B testing, or error tracking that Heap doesn't offer natively; wanting developer debugging tools like console logs and DOM inspection in session replay; needing transparent, self-serve pricing (Heap's higher tiers require sales conversations); wanting EU data residency (Heap doesn't currently offer this); or looking for an open-source platform with SQL access.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the best Heap alternative overall?</summary>

For most teams, **[PostHog](/blog/posthog-vs-heap)** is the best alternative. It's the only tool on this list that matches Heap's autocapture while also including [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/experiments), [surveys](/surveys), [error tracking](/error-tracking), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), and a built-in [data warehouse](/data-warehouse) – all with a generous free tier.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Heap alternatives support autocapture?</summary>

**PostHog**, **FullStory**, **Glassbox**, **Pendo**, and **GA4** all support some form of autocapture. PostHog and FullStory are the closest to Heap's approach – both start recording interactions immediately. GA4's "enhanced measurement" is more limited, covering basic interactions like scrolls and outbound clicks. Mixpanel and Amplitude support autocapture but rely more on manual instrumentation for deeper tracking.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Heap alternatives are open source?</summary>

**PostHog** is the only open-source Heap alternative on this list; its code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog). All other tools listed – FullStory, Glassbox, Pendo, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and GA4 – are closed-source. See our guide to the [best open-source analytics tools](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools) for more options.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Heap alternative has the best free tier?</summary>

**PostHog** offers the most generous free tier: 1 million events, 5,000 session replays, and 1 million feature flag requests per month – with no credit card required. **GA4** is free for up to 10 million events but has limited product analytics. **FullStory's** free plan includes 30,000 sessions with 12 months of retention. **Mixpanel** offers 1 million events free. **Heap's** free tier is limited to 10,000 sessions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Heap have feature flags or A/B testing?</summary>

No. **Heap** doesn't offer native feature flags or experimentation. You'd need a separate tool like **LaunchDarkly**, **Optimizely**, or **PostHog**. PostHog includes both [feature flags](/feature-flags) and [A/B testing](/experiments) natively, tightly integrated with analytics so you can measure experiment impact on funnels, retention, and revenue.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Heap have error tracking?</summary>

No. **Heap** doesn't offer error tracking or crash monitoring. If you need to monitor exceptions alongside your analytics, you'd need a separate tool like Sentry or Bugsnag. **PostHog** includes native [error tracking](/error-tracking) that connects exceptions and stack traces directly to session replays, user behavior, and feature flag changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happened to Heap after the Contentsquare acquisition?</summary>

Contentsquare [completed its acquisition of Heap](https://contentsquare.com/heap/) in December 2023.

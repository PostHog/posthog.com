## 1. PostHog

- **Founded:** 2020
- **Similar to:** Heap, Amplitude
- **Typical users:** Engineers and product teams
- **Typical customers:** Mid-size B2Bs and startups 

![posthog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/hogflix-dashboard.png)

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](https://posthog.com/) (that's us 👋) is an [open-source analytics platform](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools) that combines product analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and user surveys into one product. This means it's not just an alternative to Heap, but also tools like [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) and [LogRocket](/blog/posthog-vs-logrocket).

Typical PostHog users are engineers and product managers at startups and mid-size companies, particularly B2B companies. Customers include [AssemblyAI](/customers/assemblyai), [Hasura](/customers/hasura), [Vendasta](/customers/vendasta), and Airbus.
 
### Key features

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Funnels, user paths, retention analysis, custom trends, and dynamic user cohorts. Also supports SQL insights for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** Including event timelines, console logs, and network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 🚩 **Feature flags** with local evaluation (for faster performance) and JSON payloads.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Up to 9 test variations, primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for Net Promoter Score (NPS), product-market fit (PMF) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Heap?

PostHog is the most direct like-for-like alternative to Heap.

Unlike Mixpanel and Amplitude, PostHog supports event autocapture, which means it starts capturing data from the moment you deploy PostHog's code.

You can also [create and label events using the PostHog toolbar](/tutorials/how-to-capture-events-the-easy-way). This is similar to Heap's visual labeling feature, though it's only supported on web apps.

As of July 2023, **PostHog** is deployed by 2,365 (0.2%) of the top 1 million websites in 2023, up +327% from 554 the previous year. **Heap** is deployed by 3,200 (0.3%), but only grew by 1% YoY.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Heap (product analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (session replay and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line 
> PostHog is the only Heap alternative that offers product analytics with autocapture, session replay, and a visual labeling tool for creating events. This, combined with additional features like feature flags and surveys, makes it an excellent like-for-like replacement for Heap.

![mixpanel](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/heap-alternatives/mixpanel.png)

### What is Mixpanel?

[Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel) is one of the most popular product analytics tools on the market. Founded in 2009, in recent years it's deprecated additional features, such as A/B testing, to focus on product analytics alone.

As of July 2023, **Mixpanel** is deployed by 5,218 of the top 1 million websites in 2023. **Heap** is deployed by 3,200.

### Why do companies use Mixpanel?

1. **Eliminate need for data analysts:** Reviewers on G2 note Mixpanel helps them structure large volumes of data, and make data-driven decisions, reducing their reliance on dedicated data analysts to produce insights.

2. **Campaign targeting and tracking:** Marketing users appreciate the ability to create user segments and target specific users, enabling more personalized campaigns and improved user engagement.

3. **Understanding user behavior:** In common with most analytics tools, Mixpanel's users mostly want to understand user behavior, identify bottlenecks, and monitor core metrics like conversion rates, activation, and retention.

> #### Bottom line 
> Mixpanel is a good option to replace Heap, but it has shortcomings. The lack of autocapture is a major drawback for Heap users reliant on that feature, and you'll need to find another session replay tool if you want that feature.

<br />

## 6. Amplitude

- **Founded:** 2012
- **Most similar to:** Mixpanel
- **Typical users:** Product managers, data analysts, marketing teams
- **Typical customers:** Mid-size and large enterprises

### What is Amplitude?

[Amplitude](/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives) is an analytics and testing tool with a particular focus on large enterprise customers, like Ford, NBCUniversal, and Walmart. 

### Key features

- 💁‍♂️ **Customer data platform:** Combine analytics data with third-party tools for data governance, identity resolution, and data federation.

- 🤖 **AI insight builder:** Generate insights based on natural language requests, like "What is my purchase conversion rate?".

### How does Amplitude compare to Heap?

Like Mixpanel, Amplitude lacks features Heap users rely on, such as autocapture, visual labeling, and session replay. But its analytics features are arguably a little more mature, particularly the natural language and anomaly detection features.

<ComparisonTable column1="Amplitude" column2="Heap">
  <ComparisonRow column1="Starter plans only" column2={true} feature="Self-serve" description="Free to try, no mandatory sales calls" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Custom trends, funnels, and retention analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web analytics" description="Simple dashboard of aggregated traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Visual labeling" description="Create and tag custom events without using code" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users use your product; diagnose bugs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Feature flags" description="Roll out features safely; toggle features for cohorts or individuals" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Track metrics at account or company level" />
</ComparisonTable>

### How popular is Amplitude?

Amplitude is more than twice as popular than Heap, according to [data compiled by Jason Packer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/), an independent analytics consultant. 

As of July 2023, Amplitude is deployed by 6,973 of the top 1 million websites in 2023. Heap is deployed by 3,200.

### Why do companies use Amplitude?

1. **Reducing load on data teams:** Amplitude is designed to enable non-technical users to self-serve analytics. Amplitude cites NBCUniversal as a company that's benefited from its data team spending less time responding to requests for analysis.

2. **Large-scale experimentation:** Unlike Mixpanel, Amplitude offers built-in experimentation features. This enables companies to run experiments on users using existing cohorts created in Amplitude.

3. **Resolving data quality problems:** Companies that use Amplitude, particularly large ones, often migrate from outdated, self-built, tools that generate poor quality data. Amplitude helps them fix that while making analytics more accessible.

> #### Bottom line
> The case for Amplitude is very similar to the case for Mixpanel. It's a well-established Heap alternative, but falls short of a like-for-like replacement due to is lack of autocapture and session replay.

<br />

## 7. Google Analytics 4

- **Released:** October 2020
- **Most similar to:** Amplitude
- **Typical users:** Marketing and content teams
- **Typical customers:** Commerce websites and large enterprises

![GA4](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/mixpanel-alternatives/GA4.png)

### What is Google Analytics 4?

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is a marketing and product analytics tool that's tightly integrated with other Google products, such as Ads, BigQuery, Looker Studio, and Firebase. 

Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics (GA3), it's event-based. It also introduces new report types, such as conversion funnels and retention tables. This makes it more useful to product teams than before.

### Key features

- 🤖 **Predictive insights** alert you to trends you're not aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- 🔁 **Integration with Google tools** means it's easy to analyze your GA4 data elsewhere, such as Google's dashboarding tool, Looker Studio.

- ⌨️ **Natural language search** means you can ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather searching existing reports.

### How does GA4 compare to Heap?

GA4 is another tool that supports event autocapture, though confusingly Google calls this "enhanced analytics". 

On paper, it offers similar feature to Heap, though GA4's product analytics are less mature than those of Heap and other more established event-based tools.

<ComparisonTable column1="Google Analytics 4" column2="Heap">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Self-serve" description="Free to try, no mandatory sales calls" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Custom trends, funnels, and retention analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web analytics" description="Simple dashboard of aggregated traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Visual labeling" description="Create and tag custom events without using code" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users use your product; diagnose bugs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Feature flags" description="Roll out features safely; toggle features for cohorts or individuals" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="A/B testing" description="Test changes and analyze their impact" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="User surveys" description="Ask users for qualitative feedback and gather responses" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Heatmaps" description="See where users click and interact" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Track metrics at account or company level" />
</ComparisonTable>

### How popular is GA4?

Google Analytics remains the most-used analytics tool in the world by a large margin. 

As of July 2023, [30.5% of the top 1 million websites](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jhpacker_just-updated-the-popularity-numbers-on-my-activity-7112462135120601088-YLdh/) run GA4 – another 35.7% were still running GA3.

### Why do companies use GA4?

1. **Because it's Google:** It's not an original reason, but it holds true. Using Google Analytics makes a lot of sense for teams who rely on other Google platforms, like [Google Ads](/tutorials/google-ads-reports) and BigQuery.

2. **It's powerful and free:** Likewise, Google's scale means GA4 is completely free to most small and medium-sized businesses. This, combined with strong analytical tools and the large ecosystem of GA experts to call upon, makes it a safe choice.

3. **To track marketing ROI:** GA4 is predominantly used by marketing and e-commerce teams to track campaign ROI. It's also popular among large content publishers for its scalability.

> #### Bottom line
> Until recently, Google Analytics wasn't a viable Heap alternative. The launch of GA4 changed this, but switching from Heap to Google only makes sense if you're keen to integrate deeper into Google's ecosystem of data tools, like BigQuery and Looker Studio.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch. 

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Heap replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want to use fewer tools (we can replace way more than just Heap)
- You want try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

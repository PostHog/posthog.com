PostHog and Optimizely are both multi-product tools to help you improve your apps and websites. Beyond experimentation and feature flags, they have significantly different focuses:

- PostHog helps you build better product with tools like [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), and [surveys](/surveys).

- [Optimizely](/blog/best-optimizely-alternatives) is an all-in-one system for marketing that includes content management, campaign planning, asset management, and checkout customizations.

This post compares their platforms, experimentation features, reporting, pricing, and more.

## How is PostHog different than Optimizely?

### 1. Product and startup-focused

PostHog is built for high-growth startups working to build the best possible products. It's easy to get started and provides all the tools you need at an early stage. There's a generous free plan and [startups](/startups) get free credits. 

Optimizely focuses on providing marketing, ecommerce, and content tools to massive enterprises. It has fewer product focused tools. 

### 2. Transparent, free, and self-service

PostHog is open source. Everything from our [code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) to [roadmap](/roadmap) to [strategy](/handbook) is open for everyone to see. 

Along with this, you can [sign up for PostHog for free](https://app.posthog.com/). You donâ€™t need to fill out a contact form, add a credit card, or have a sales call. You can use PostHog for free forever if you want.

Optimizely is open about some areas, like roadmap and its SDKs, but you have to talk to sales before signing up.

### 3. Analytics and reporting built-in

PostHog links all its tools together. This means you get all the features and visualizations of product analytics for your feature flags and A/B tests. You can use them in [trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends), [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels), and even directly query related metrics with [SQL](/docs/product-analytics/sql).

Optimizely has some analytics, such as web marketing, but largely relies on Google Analytics for tracking and reporting. This limits the analysis you can do related to your feature flags and experiments. 

## Platform

Although both Optimizely and PostHog provide experimentation and feature flags, their overall platforms are significantly different.

- The big platform difference between the two beyond marketing vs product features is **analytics**. Optimizely relies on external analytics providers like Google and [Adobe Analytics](/blog/best-adobe-analytics-alternatives) to track feature flags and A/B tests. PostHog has a full analytics suite built-in, including [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), [custom events](/docs/getting-started/send-events#2-capture-custom-events), direct SQL access, and more.

- Being a marketing-focused platform, Optimizely includes project and content management tools like request forms, asset libraries, and hypothesis briefs. PostHog leaves the planning to the other tools you are using but does include notebooks for analysis.

## Web experimentation

Optimizely splits its experimentation features into two separate categories, web and feature. We will compare both separately against PostHog. 

The core web experimentation features like traffic allocation, preview mode, cross-browser, dynamic website support, targeting, and more are available in both Optimizely and PostHog 

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Optimizely">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="A/B/n tests" description="Do tests with multiple variants" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom targeting" description="Target users with custom attributes" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom goals" description="Set experiment goals to any metric" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Single-page app support" description="Use app frameworks like React and Vue" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="No-code experiments" description="Implement experiments without code" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Low-code experiments" description="Implement experiments with a small amount of code" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Funnel tests" description="Use funnels as a goal" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Native analytics" description="Track experiments without third-party tools" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Scheduling" description="Schedule experiments to run at specific times" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Use external data" description="Use data from other platforms in experiments" />
</ComparisonTable>

- In Optimizely, many features of web experiments, like scheduling, multi-armed bandits, [multi-variate testing](/tutorials/abn-testing), and advanced personalization are only available on the higher-tier "Accelerate" plan or as add-ons.

- PostHog doesn't offer a no-code experiment creator yet, but it does have a UI to create and manage experiments as well as snippets to make it easy to implement them. For example, you can add a basic experiment anywhere you can insert custom JavaScript like this:

```html
<script>
  !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.crossOrigin="anonymous",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="capture identify alias people.set people.set_once set_config register register_once unregister opt_out_capturing has_opted_out_capturing opt_in_capturing reset isFeatureEnabled onFeatureFlags getFeatureFlag getFeatureFlagPayload reloadFeatureFlags group updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment getEarlyAccessFeatures getActiveMatchingSurveys getSurveys getNextSurveyStep".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);
  posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>',{api_host:'<ph_client_api_host>', person_profiles: 'identified_only'})
  
  posthog.onFeatureFlags(() => {
    // Check the value of the 'test-flag' feature flag
    if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('test-flag') === 'test') {
      // If the feature flag is enabled, change the text of the landing-header
      const landingHeader = document.getElementById('landing-header');
      if (landingHeader) {
        landingHeader.textContent = "Welcome to our site!";
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Feature experimentation

Feature experimentation relates to releasing and testing feature changes in your product. Both Optimizely and PostHog have all the core features to do this safely and effectively.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Optimizely">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Flags" description="Use and evaluate feature flags" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Rollouts" description="Control rollout of features remotely" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="User targeting" description="Target specific users" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Logging" description="Log flag usage" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Audience builder" description="Known as cohorts in PostHog" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Custom attributes" description="Known as properties in PostHog" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="UI controls" description="Configure experiments with UI" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Stats engine" description="Calculate the statistical significance of experiments" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Remote configuration" description="Configure your experiments without changing code" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Partial" column2={true} feature="Environments" description="Manage flags for dev, staging, prod" />
</ComparisonTable>

In Optimizely, many of the feature experimentation features, like multi-armed bandits and custom segmentation, are only available are the higher tier plans. These are all available for free in PostHog.

## Pricing

PostHog and Optimizely are very different here. Optimizely is sales-driven and completely opaque. PostHog is self-serve and transparent.

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Optimizely">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Transparent" description="See pricing without talking to sales" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Usage-based" description="Pay based on how much you use" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Free tier" description="Use for free forever" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Per-product pricing" description="Separate pricing for each product" />
</ComparisonTable>

For many Optimizely products, there are also paid add-ons like advanced personalization, the data platform, and their Salesforce integration. PostHog only has free and paid tiers for each product with a single addition enterprise add-on for SSO, dedicated support, and advanced permissions.

## Reporting

Although Optimizely has web analytics through its content marketing platform, it relies on Google Analytics or other third-party analytics providers for advanced tracking and reporting. 

PostHogâ€™s product analytics suite shines here. It treats feature flags and experiments as usage, so you can analyze them like any other user behavior. On top of standard experiment results, you can use visualizations like trends, funnels, user paths, and even direct SQL access. 

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Optimizely">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Native analytics" description="Track experiments without the use of third parties" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Results" description="View experiment results" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Segment results" description="Break results down for segments" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Secondary metrics" description="Monitor non-goal metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Winner" description="Calculate the winning experiment variant" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Custom insights" description="Query and customize analytics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Trends" description="Visualize results as a trend" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Funnels" description="Visualize results as a funnel" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Confidence interval" description="Show confidence in results" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Session replay" description="View user sessions related to the experiments" />
</ComparisonTable>

Another bonus of PostHog is the ability to view user sessions related to feature flags and experiments. You can see directly how they respond to new features and changes as well as how it affects the rest of their session.

## SDKs and API

PostHog and Optimizely both support similar languages and frameworks with SDKs, as well as provide an API for interacting with data. 
<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Optimizely">
  <ComparisonRow column1="14" column2="14" feature="Total count" description="Total number of SDKs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Client" description="JavaScript, React" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Server" description="Node, Python, Go, PHP" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Mobile" description="Android, iOS" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="OTT" description="Over-the-top TV applications" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="API" description="Access and update data through REST API" />
</ComparisonTable>

## Integrations

PostHogâ€™s integrations are free while Optimizely often requires a subscription to their data platform "enhancement."

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Optimizely">
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Google Analytics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2="Add-on" feature="Salesforce" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="CDP" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Zapier" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Segment" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Exports" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="S3" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Snowflake" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="BigQuery" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Slack" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Teams" />
</ComparisonTable>

PostHogâ€™s [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) further expands these destinations by enabling you to use data from these sources directly in PostHog. 

## Privacy, admin, & security

Both PostHog and Optimizely have the privacy and compliance tools users expect.

import ProductComparisonTable from 'components/ProductComparisonTable'

PostHog and Optimizely are both multi-product tools to help you improve your apps and websites. Beyond experimentation and feature flags, they have significantly different focuses:

- PostHog helps you build better products with tools like [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), and [surveys](/surveys).

- [Optimizely](/blog/best-optimizely-alternatives) is an all-in-one system for marketing that includes content management, campaign planning, asset management, and checkout customizations.

This post compares their platforms, experimentation features, reporting, pricing, and more.

## How is PostHog different than Optimizely?

### 1. Product and startup-focused

PostHog is built for high-growth startups working to build the best possible products. It's easy to get started and provides all the tools you need at an early stage. There's a generous free plan and [startups](/startups) get free credits. 

Optimizely focuses on providing marketing, ecommerce, and content tools to massive enterprises. It has fewer product focused tools. 

### 2. Transparent, free, and self-service

PostHog is open source. Everything from our [code](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) to [roadmap](/roadmap) to [strategy](/handbook) is open for everyone to see. 

Along with this, you can [sign up for PostHog for free](https://app.posthog.com/). You donâ€™t need to fill out a contact form, add a credit card, or have a sales call. You can use PostHog for free forever if you want.

Optimizely is open about some areas, like roadmap and its SDKs, but you have to talk to sales before signing up.

### 3. Analytics and reporting built-in

PostHog links all its tools together. This means you get all the features and visualizations of product analytics for your feature flags and A/B tests. You can use them in [trends](/docs/product-analytics/trends), [funnels](/docs/product-analytics/funnels), and even directly query related metrics with [SQL](/docs/product-analytics/sql).

Optimizely has some analytics, such as web marketing, but largely relies on Google Analytics for tracking and reporting. This limits the analysis you can do related to your feature flags and experiments. 

## Platform

Although both Optimizely and PostHog provide experimentation and feature flags, their overall platforms are significantly different.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        'platform.deployment.open_source',
        { label: 'Self-service', description: 'Start without talking to sales', customValue: true },
        'experiments',

        { label: 'Project management', description: 'Manage projects related to experiments', customValue: false },
    ]}
/>

- The big platform difference between the two beyond marketing vs product features is **analytics**. Optimizely relies on external analytics providers like Google and [Adobe Analytics](/blog/best-adobe-analytics-alternatives) to track feature flags and A/B tests. PostHog has a full analytics suite built-in, including [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), [custom events](/docs/getting-started/send-events#2-capture-custom-events), direct SQL access, and more.

- Being a marketing-focused platform, Optimizely includes project and content management tools like request forms, asset libraries, and hypothesis briefs. PostHog leaves the planning to the other tools you are using but does include notebooks for analysis.

## Web experimentation

Optimizely splits its experimentation features into two separate categories, web and feature. We will compare both separately against PostHog. 

The core web experimentation features like traffic allocation, preview mode, cross-browser, dynamic website support, targeting, and more are available in both Optimizely and PostHog 

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        { label: 'A/B/n tests', description: 'Do tests with multiple variants', customValue: true },
        'experiments.features.custom_targeting',
        'experiments.features.custom_goals',
        { label: 'Single-page app support', description: 'Use app frameworks like React and Vue', customValue: true },
        'experiments.features.no_code_experiments',
        { label: 'Low-code experiments', description: 'Implement experiments with a small amount of code', customValue: true },
        'experiments.features.funnel_metrics',
        { label: 'Native analytics', description: 'Track experiments without third-party tools', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Scheduling', description: 'Schedule experiments to run at specific times', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Use external data', description: 'Use data from other platforms in experiments', customValue: true },
    ]}
/>

- In Optimizely, many features of web experiments, like scheduling, multi-armed bandits, [multi-variate testing](/tutorials/abn-testing), and advanced personalization are only available on the higher-tier "Accelerate" plan or as add-ons.

- PostHog doesn't offer a no-code experiment creator yet, but it does have a UI to create and manage experiments as well as snippets to make it easy to implement them. For example, you can add a basic experiment anywhere you can insert custom JavaScript like this:

```html
<script>
  !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.crossOrigin="anonymous",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="capture identify alias people.set people.set_once set_config register register_once unregister opt_out_capturing has_opted_out_capturing opt_in_capturing reset isFeatureEnabled onFeatureFlags getFeatureFlag getFeatureFlagPayload reloadFeatureFlags group updateEarlyAccessFeatureEnrollment getEarlyAccessFeatures getActiveMatchingSurveys getSurveys getNextSurveyStep".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);
  posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>',{api_host:'<ph_client_api_host>', defaults:'<ph_posthog_js_defaults>'})
  
  posthog.onFeatureFlags(() => {
    // Check the value of the 'test-flag' feature flag
    if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('test-flag') === 'test') {
      // If the feature flag is enabled, change the text of the landing-header
      const landingHeader = document.getElementById('landing-header');
      if (landingHeader) {
        landingHeader.textContent = "Welcome to our site!";
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

## Feature experimentation

Feature experimentation relates to releasing and testing feature changes in your product. Both Optimizely and PostHog have all the core features to do this safely and effectively.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        'feature_flags.features.boolean_flags',
        'feature_flags.features.percentage_rollouts',
        'feature_flags.features.custom_targeting',
        { label: 'Logging', description: 'Log flag usage', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Audience builder', description: 'Known as cohorts in PostHog', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Custom attributes', description: 'Known as properties in PostHog', customValue: true },
        { label: 'UI controls', description: 'Configure experiments with UI', customValue: true },
        'experiments.features.statistical_significance',
        { label: 'Remote configuration', description: 'Configure your experiments without changing code', customValue: true },
        'feature_flags.features.multi_environment',
    ]}
/>

In Optimizely, many of the feature experimentation features, like multi-armed bandits and custom segmentation, are only available in higher tier plans. These are all available for free in PostHog.

## Pricing

PostHog and Optimizely are very different here. Optimizely is sales-driven and completely opaque. PostHog is self-serve and transparent.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        'platform.pricing.transparent_pricing',
        'platform.pricing.usage_based_pricing',
        'platform.pricing.free_tier',
        { label: 'Per-product pricing', description: 'Separate pricing for each product', customValue: true },
    ]}
/>

For many Optimizely products, there are also paid add-ons like advanced personalization, the data platform, and their Salesforce integration. PostHog only has free and paid tiers for each product with a single enterprise add-on for SSO, dedicated support, and advanced permissions.

## Reporting

Although Optimizely has web analytics through its content marketing platform, it relies on Google Analytics or other third-party analytics providers for advanced tracking and reporting. 

PostHogâ€™s product analytics suite shines here. It treats feature flags and experiments as usage, so you can analyze them like any other user behavior. On top of standard experiment results, you can use visualizations like trends, funnels, user paths, and even direct SQL access. 

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        { label: 'Native analytics', description: 'Track experiments without the use of third parties', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Results', description: 'View experiment results', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Segment results', description: 'Break results down for segments', customValue: true },
        'experiments.features.secondary_metrics',
        { label: 'Winner', description: 'Calculate the winning experiment variant', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Custom insights', description: 'Query and customize analytics', customValue: true },
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        { label: 'Confidence interval', description: 'Show confidence in results', customValue: true },
        'session_replay',
    ]}
/>

Another bonus of PostHog is the ability to view user sessions related to feature flags and experiments. You can see directly how they respond to new features and changes as well as how it affects the rest of their session.

## SDKs and API

PostHog and Optimizely both support similar languages and frameworks with SDKs, as well as provide an API for interacting with data. 
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        'platform.developer.sdks',
        { label: 'Client', description: 'JavaScript, React', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Server', description: 'Node, Python, Go, PHP', customValue: true },
        { label: 'Mobile', description: 'Android, iOS', customValue: true },
        { label: 'OTT', description: 'Over-the-top TV applications', customValue: false },
        'platform.developer.api',
    ]}
/>

## Integrations

PostHogâ€™s integrations are free while Optimizely often requires a subscription to their data platform "enhancement."

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        { label: 'Google Analytics', customValue: false },
        'platform.integrations.salesforce',
        'cdp',
        'platform.integrations.zapier',
        'platform.integrations.segment',
        'platform.integrations.exports',
        'platform.integrations.s3',
        'platform.integrations.snowflake',
        'platform.integrations.bigquery',
        'platform.integrations.slack',
        'platform.integrations.microsoft_teams',
    ]}
/>

PostHogâ€™s [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) further expands these destinations by enabling you to use data from these sources directly in PostHog. 

## Privacy, admin, & security

Both PostHog and Optimizely have the privacy and compliance tools users expect.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'optimizely']}
    rows={[
        { label: 'Change history', description: 'Trail of changes to data', customValue: true },
        'platform.security.saml_sso',
        'platform.security.two_factor_auth',
        { label: 'Roles and permissions', description: 'Control who can do what', customValue: true },
        'platform.security.gdpr_ready',
        { label: 'Cookieless', description: 'Use product without cookies', customValue: true },
        { label: 'DPA available', description: 'Enter into Data Processing Agreements', customValue: true },
    ]}

## PostHog 1.28.1 patch

This version includes a subsequent patch release (1.28.1) launched on **September 22, 2021**. This patch addresses the following fixes and improvements:

## PostHog 1.28.0 release notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

**Release highlights:**

- [Significantly revamped performance](#significantly-revamped-performance).
- [Advanced engagement cohorts](#advanced-engagement-cohorts).
- [SAML support](#saml-support).
- [Advanced funnel building](#advanced-funnel-building).

### Significantly revamped performance

When running on OSS ClickHouse, we now automatically create (during the weekends) columns for event and person properties which pre-process some of the heaviest operations when running queries. This can speed up your slower queries 2-25x.

### Advanced engagement cohorts

You can now better analyze engagement among your users by understanding casual and power users in more detail. Create automatic user cohorts based on actions performed by users in the last N days. You can select users who have performed more than, exactly, or less than any given number of actions/events, and customize the time range you care about.

### SAML support

Users with a PostHog Scale license can now enable SAML authentication and automatic user provisioning in their instance. If your company uses a centralized identity provider (IdP), this is a great way to reduce IT overhead and improve compliance. Head over to our [SAML docs](/docs/user-guides/sso#saml) for details on how to enable this.

### Advanced funnel building

In our [last release](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-27-0) we shipped significant improvements to our funnels experience. We are still on a mission to enable anyone to get a deep understanding of their user conversion rates. In this release, we're including even more features to build advanced funnel visualizations to enable deeper diving. Such features include custom step ordering, event exclusions, conversion time range window, and more.

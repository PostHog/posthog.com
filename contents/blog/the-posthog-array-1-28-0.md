### Community MVP üèÜ

Thanks to all our community members for helping move PostHog forward! This release cycle's Community MVP goes to... [manish001in](https://github.com/manish001in)!

Manish helped us pushed a PR that ensures tab titles are properly set when navigating between dashboards (PR [#5822](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5822)) and is also pushing a PR to make it easy to copy properties from the person page (PR [#5884](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/5884)).

### Help us improve PostHog

We‚Äôre working hard to improve the PostHog experience and would love to talk to you! Please join one of our Product, Engineering or Marketing team members on a quick 30-min call to help us understand how to improve. Schedule directly [on Calendly](https://calendly.com/posthog-feedback).

As a small thank you for your time, we're giving away some awesome [PostHog merch](https://merch.posthog.com)!

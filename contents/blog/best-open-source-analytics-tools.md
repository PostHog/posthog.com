Most well-known analytics tools demand hefty price tags, and they own your data. This is bad news for early-stage startups, or anyone who cares about user privacy. Thankfully, open-source analytics tools are better, and more numerous, than ever before.

Most open source alternatives to the likes of Google Analytics, Amplitude, or Mixpanel are either free, or significantly cheaper. They also allow you to modify and extend them however you wish.

Here, we’ve selected some of the best open-source analytics tools across a range of categories, including big data platforms, specialized web analytics tools, A/B testing tools, [open-source feature flag tools](/blog/best-open-source-feature-flag-tools), and all-in-one platforms like PostHog.

## 1. [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)
![PostHog - best open source analytics tools](../images/blog/gdpr-compliant-analytics/posthog-gdpr-compliant.png)

PostHog is an all-in-one open-source analytics platform that offers all the essential tools you need to build better products, including funnels, feature flags, path analysis, A/B testing, heat maps, and more – it's also one of the [best open source session recording tools](/blog/best-open-source-session-replay-tools) around. 

It’s entirely self-serve, with the ability to auto-capture event information out of the box. The interface makes querying your data a breeze, with no SQL required. 

Best of all, PostHog can be self-hosted on your existing infrastructure — making it an excellent alternative to tools such as Mixpanel if you’re concerned about privacy. 

Of course, we _would_ say PostHog is great, but if you need convincing then you can [get started for free](/pricing) and decide for yourself. You can self-host, but [PostHog Cloud is free up to 1 million events per month](/pricing#cloud) if you'd prefer a fully-managed experience.

### Who is PostHog for?
PostHog is ideal for engineering, data science, and product teams. As an all-in-one platform, it combines the functionality of traditional product analytics platforms with tools like Feature Flags, Session Recording and A/B testing, making it ideal for teams who want a complete view of their product without the hassle of running multiple separate tools.

### Strengths
- All-in-one analytics suite
- Easy-to-use, no SQL required
- Self-hosting and cloud-hosting available
- Feature flags for running A/B tests
- Session recording for gathering insights
- Event pipelines to integrate with data warehouses
- Unlimited ability to scale 

### Open source license
PostHog Open Source is available under an MIT license. It offers a free version that’s great for start-ups, as well as premium options for large event volumes. Find out more about [self-hosting PostHog](/pricing).

## 2. [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)
![Matomo - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/matomo-screenshot.png)

Matomo is an open source platform for web analytics, rather than a product analytics. That means it's great for understanding metrics such as pageviews or for planning keywords, but it lacks product analytics features such as session recording or feature flags. Nevertheless, it's an alternative to Google Analytics for users who want to protect user privacy. 

### Who is Matomo for?
Matomo is intended for marketing and content teams who need to focus on SEO activities without losing control of their user data. It is suitable for both small and enterprise businesses.

### Strengths
- Funnels, cohorts and acquisition analysis
- E-commerce and advertising tools
- Import data from Google Analytics
- SEO and media analytics tools

### Open source license
Matomo is available under a AGPLv3 license. Pricing depends mainly on the amount of traffic, with free options available for low-traffic sites. Check [the Matomo repo on GitHub](https://github.com/piwik/piwik) for more information.

![Countly - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/countly-screenshot.png)

Like PostHog, Countly offers a wide range of tools to help you build better products. It has a strong focus on mobile products and enables you to bring together both qualitative and quantitative insights. However many features, such as dashboards or funnel analysis, are only available in the enterprise-level product.

### Who is Countly for?
Countly is suitable for both small teams and enterprise businesses, especially those which focus on mobile products. The crash analytics tools make it especially useful for customer support and engineering teams. 

### Strengths
- Wide range of analysis tools, including funnels

### Open source license

## 4. [OpenReplay](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay)

![Countly - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/openreplay.png)

OpenReplay is a session replay suite built for developers and privacy conscious companies. While it lacks many core analytics features, such as measuring pageviews on landing pages, it delivers useful analytical tools that augment others.

Its session replay feature automatically captures events, and provides useful click maps in addition to detecting rage clicks and slow loading pages. It also offers a straightforward funnel analysis, performance monitoring, error tracking, and extensive integrations with other logging tools.

### Who is OpenReplay for?
OpenReplay is primarily for developers, especially due to its focus on error tracking and bug fixing. It can be self-hosted for free, though a cloud version is available for $3.95 per 1,000 monthly recordings.

### Strengths

- Optimizing conversion and understanding user journeys

### Open source license

![Plausible Analytics - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/plausible-screenshot.png)

Like Matomo, Plausible Analytics is focused on providing website analytics that don’t infringe on user privacy. That means Plausible doesn’t rely on cookies and is compliant with regulations such as GDPR. 

Unlike Matomo, Plausible is a very streamlined tool rather than a full-blown Google Analytics alternative. As a result it is a great fit for smaller teams who prefer ease of use to in-depth reporting, or hobby deployments if you just want basic analytics for a website or blog.

### Who is Plausible Analytics for?
Plausible is intended for Marketing and Content teams who need to focus on specific SEO metrics. It's designed for use in small to medium businesses or teams. 

### Strengths
- Easy to use and focused on essential web metrics

## 6. GrowthBook

![GrowthBook - best open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-testing-tools/growthbook.png)

GrowthBook is an [open source A/B testing](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools) and feature flag tool for teams who want granular control over rolling out new features, and the ability to validate those changes through experiments. 

It supports multiple development environments, each with a unique API endpoint, and its comprehensive feature flag functionality allows for targeting based on user properties.

You don't need to import metric data into GrowthBook as it works with your data wherever it lives, be that a data warehouse or a analytics tool like Mixpanel, but it lacks any additional analytics features.

### Who is GrowthBook for?

GrowthBook is ideal for engineering teams who want flexible, instant control over what users see in their product and already have, or don't require, a broader analytics platform. It can be self-hosted free-for-life, but there's a cloud option as well which is free for up to five seats, then $20 per seat per month thereafter.

### Strengths
- Multivariate feature flags
- Support for Mixpanel JQL querying
- A/B testing visual editor
- Can be self-hosted
- No performance impact

### Open source license

GrowthBook is distributed under an MIT license. Check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook) for more info.

## 7. [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
![Apache Spark - open source analytics tool](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/apache-spark-screenshot.png)

Apache Spark is an open-source analytics engine specifically focused on large-scale data analysis — or big data analytics, as it’s commonly known. It can run on a wide range of technologies, including Hadoop, Apache Mesos or Kubernetes, which makes it an incredibly versatile analytics option. 

However, the focus on libraries such as SQL make Apache Spark difficult for non-technical users as support is provided solely by the community.

### Who is Apache Spark for?
Apache Spark is a technical system intended for Data Engineers and Data Scientists conducting large-scale analytics in an enterprise setting. 

### Strengths
- Great for very large data volumes
- Use libraries such as MLlib for machine learning
- Works with R, Java, Python, Scala and SQL
- Process data in real-time using clusters

### Open source license
Apache Spark is available under the Apache 2.0 license and is entirely free, via [the Apache Spark repo](https://github.com/apache/spark).

## 8. [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/)
![Metabase - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/metabase-screenshot.png)

Metabase is one of the most popular open-source business intelligence (BI) tools in the world, offering teams a way to visualize complex data and run analysis with no coding required. Instead, Metabase’s visual query builder enables you to create shareable dashboards in just a few minutes with a drag-and-drop interface — though a native SQL editor is available for advanced users.

### Who is Metabase for?
Metabase has a drag-and-drop interface which makes it especially useful for less technical users or Marketing and Growth teams. It is suitable for businesses or teams of any size. It is not designed for product analytics - instead, it is focused on more general analytics.

### Strengths
- Easy-to-use, no SQL required
- Automated reports and interactive dashboards
- Self-hosting and cloud-hosting available

### Open source license
Metabase is available under a AGPL license. A limited version of the product is available for free, while an Enterprise license is available for a cost. Check [the Metabase repo](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) for more information. 

## 9. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) 
![Grafana - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/grafana-screenshot.png)

Grafana is more of a data observability platform than a pure open source analytics tool. This is due to the fact that it focuses on interactive visualization, providing a wide variety of charts, graphs and alerts which can be connected to a wide range of online data sources. As a result, it’s a powerful system for monitoring and analyzing data in real-time.  

### Who is Grafana for?
Grafana is an ideal choice for Engineering, Dev Ops or Data Scientists in businesses or teams of any size, including enterprise, who need to observe and monitor data. It is not designed for product analytics.

### Strengths
- Great for tracking data in real-time
- Multiple products allow you to scale
- Get alerts when anomalous events occur
- Integrates with a wide range of data sources

### Open source license
Grafana is available under an AGPLv3 license. A limited version is available for free, while an Enterprise license is available for a cost. Check [the Grafana repo](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) for more info.

### 10. [Open Web Analytics](https://www.openwebanalytics.com/)

![OWA - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/owa.png)

Open Web Analytics (OWA) won't win any awards for presentation, but it offers plenty of features as standard and total freedom to extend it as you please.

The core feature-set is Google Analytics adjacent, tracking things like unique users, page views, session duration, and pages per visit in a GA-like manner. But OWA goes further than most by including e-commerce reporting, custom action tracking, heatmaps, and tracking clicks on all DOM elements.

### Who is Open Web Analytics for?

It's ideal for hobbyists and small websites that don't want to use Google Analytics. Unlike Matomo, e-commerce tracking is a free feature (in fact, there is no paid version at all), making it a good option for a simple web store.

### Open source license

OWA is distributed under a GPLv2 license and can be [downloaded via its GitHub repo](https://github.com/Open-Web-Analytics/Open-Web-Analytics). There are no paid or cloud-hosted versions.


## 11. [Fathom Lite](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom)
![Fathom Lite - open source analytics tools](../images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/fathom.png)

Fathom Lite is a basic, privacy-focused web analytics tool. It's no longer in active development with Fathom Analytics going closed core, but the developers are committed to maintaning it and fixing bugs. It tracks pageviews, unique users, bounce rate, and average time on site via a fast, easy-to-understand dashboard.

### Who is Fathon Lite?

It's ideal for anyone who wants basic web analytics that respects user privacy for a personal or business website.

### Open source license

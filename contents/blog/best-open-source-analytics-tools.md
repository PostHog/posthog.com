It's a truth universally acknowledged that every business reliant on an outmoded enterprise product has need of an open source alternative... probably.

In this guide we're looking at open-source analytics tools, which we've split into two broad categories:

- [Open-source analytics tools](#the-best-open-source-analytics-tools) that collect data and help you understand user behavior. This includes product analytics platforms, but also web analytics, session recording, and AB testing tools.

- [Open-source data analytics](#the-best-open-source-data-and-bi-tools) and business intelligence tools that connect to data sources for building dashboards, insights, interactive visualizations, and real-time data logging.

We've chosen each entry carefully based on a broad range factors, such as popularity and user growth, community size and activity, our own experience using them, and publicly available feedback and sentiment.

We have separate guides on [open-source feature flag tools](/blog/best-open-source-feature-flag-tools) and [open-source AB testing products](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

> **Changelog** 
> - **Jun 16, 2022:** Added Fathom Lite, Open Web Analytics, GrowthBook, OpenReplay
> - **Aug 24, 2022:** Removed Fathom Lite, Open Web Analytics; added Apache Superset, Redash

## The best open source analytics tools

This section is dedicated to tools that actively collect data on user behavior. These range from the very simple, such as the privacy-focused Plausible, to broad analytics tools like Matomo.

### PostHog

## What are the criteria for this guide?

This guide only includes open-source analytics tools that:

1. **Enable users to visualize and analyze behavioral data for products or websites.** This includes tools that actively capture data as well as dashboarding tools that connect to existing data sources, but not data pipeline platforms like Snowplow or Rudderstack. 

2. **Are actively developed or maintained by a company or community.** This is subjectively judged based on recently merged pull requests, commits to their repos, and the responsiveness of the maintainer to review requests.

3. **Are self-hostable.** Tools that are "open core" but don't offer a free, self-hostable deployment option are not included.

## Who maintains this guide?

This guide is maintained by [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), an open-source analytics platform. You can suggest additions to this guide by opening an issue on our [website repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com). We update the guide ~3 times per year.

We maintain separate guides on [open-source feature flag tools](/blog/best-open-source-feature-flag-tools) and [open-source AB testing products](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

Features include a comprehensive product analytics suite (e.g. trend analysis, dashboards, funnels, path analysis, retention tracking etc.), feature flags for feature control, experimentation (A/B and [multivariate testing](/product-engineers/what-is-multivariate-testing-examples)), session recording, heatmaps and [more](/product).

It’s entirely self-serve, with the ability to autocapture event information out of the box. PostHog can also be self-hosted on your existing infrastructure using Docker Compose, making it ideal if you don't want to share data with third parties. 

It's a good option if you're after an [open-source session recording tool](/blog/best-open-source-session-replay-tools), too.

[Plausible Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-plausible) is focused on providing website analytics that don’t infringe on user privacy. That means Plausible doesn’t rely on cookies and is naturally compliant with regulations like GDPR. 

Unlike Matomo, Plausible is a very streamlined tool rather than a feature-equivalent Google Analytics alternative. As a result, it's a great fit for smaller teams who prefer ease of use to in-depth reporting, or hobby deployments if you just want basic analytics for a website or blog.

#### Who is Plausible Analytics for?
[Plausible](/blog/posthog-vs-plausible) is intended for marketing teams and website owners who want to track top-level website metrics, such as pageviews, bounce rate and visit duration, but it's not an ideal tool for understanding user behavior.

- Lightweight integration script won’t impact page performance
- No cookies required, GDPR compliant out of the box 

#### License and monetization
Plausible Analytics is available under a AGPLv3 license and can be self-hosted via Docker Compose. Pricing for its hosted version starts at €9 per month for 10,000 monthly pageviews.

> **Also consider:** Plausible is one of a large subset of privacy-first analytics products that have proven popular in the wake of GDPR and less permissive attitudes to user tracking. [Umami](https://umami.is/) is another popular, open-source product in this space. Read our [GDPR analytics guide](/blog/best-gdpr-compliant-analytics-tools) for more options.

### 5. Grafana

Its session replay feature automatically captures events, and provides useful click maps in addition to detecting rage clicks and slow loading pages. It also offers funnel analysis, performance monitoring, error tracking, and extensive integrations with other logging tools.

It supports multiple development environments, each with a unique API endpoint, and its comprehensive feature flag functionality allows for targeting based on person properties.

You don't need to import metric data into GrowthBook as it works with your data wherever it lives, be that a data warehouse or an analytics tool like Mixpanel, but it lacks any additional analytical features.

#### Who is GrowthBook for?

[GrowthBook](/blog/best-growthbook-alternatives) is ideal for engineering teams who want flexible, instant control over what users see in their product and already have, or don't require, a broader analytics platform.

- Can be self-hosted
- No performance impact

- [Redash on GitHub](https://github.com/getredash/redash)

#### What is Redash?

Like Metabase, Redash is a tool for connecting to and visualizing data from a number of different sources. Unlike Metabase, you need to be fluent in SQL to get the most from it.

#### Who is Superset for?

Superset is ideal for enterprises with experienced in-house data teams. It can handle large data sets, and provides extensive permissioning systems, so you can restrict access to sensitive data.

#### What is Countly?

Like PostHog, [Countly](https://count.ly/) offers a wide range of tools to help you build better products. It has a strong focus on mobile and desktop applications, and enables you to bring together both qualitative and quantitative insights. However many features, such as dashboards, funnel analysis, and retention tracking are only available in the enterprise-level product.

#### Who is Countly for?

Countly is suitable for both small teams and enterprise businesses, especially those which focus on mobile apps. The crash analytics tools make it useful for customer support and engineering teams, too. 

#### Strengths

- Wide range of analysis tools
- Focus on mobile and desktop app development
- Crash analytics to diagnose bugs
- Run surveys to get qualitative insights

#### Open source license and monetization
Countly's Community Edition is available under a AGPLv3 license, but it's somewhat limited. It includes versions of its core analytics features, but customer behavior insights (e.g. retention, cohorts, funnels, user paths) are only available in the paid Enterprise Edition. Countly doesn't provide public pricing information.

### 12. Open Web Analytics

![open web analytics](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/open-source-analytics-tools/owa.png)

- **GitHub Stars:** 2.2k
- **Category:** Website analytics
- **Alternative to:** Google Analytics
- **Languages:** 67% PHP, 23% JavaScript
- [OWA on GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Web-Analytics/Open-Web-Analytics)

#### What is Open Web Analytics?

[Open Web Analytics](https://www.openwebanalytics.com/) is an entirely free, open-source alternative to Google Analytics. In addition to usual web analytics basics, it includes a basic heatmap feature, and the ability to track clicks on all DOM elements. It's less focused on privacy than others in this list, so you can use it to track when users come back, and perform basic campaign and ecommerce tracking. 

In comparative terms, it's more advanced than Plausible and Umami, but less advanced than Matomo or PostHog, though the interface is somewhat dated. 

#### Who is Open Web Analytics for?

OWA suits developers who want self-hosted analytics, but desire more tracking capabilities than privacy-focused alternatives like Plausible.

#### Strengths

- Simple GDPR compliance
- Control over your own data
- Heatmap and DOM element tracking
- Basic campaign and e-commerce tracking

#### Open source license and monetization
Open Web Analytics is distributed under the GPL-2.0 license. There are no paid features.

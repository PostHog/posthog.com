There's no shortage of high-quality open-source analytics tools. In this guide we've split them into two categories:

- [Analytics tools](#the-best-open-source-analytics-tools) that collect data and help you understand user behavior. This includes product analytics platforms, but also web analytics, session recording, and AB testing tools.

- [Dashboarding tools](#the-best-open-source-dashboard-and-bi-tools) that connect to data sources (e.g. a data warehouse) for building dashboards, insights, interactive visualizations, and real-time data logging.

We've chosen each entry carefully based on a broad range factors, community size and activity, our own experience using them, and publicly available feedback and sentiment.

We have separate guides on [open-source feature flag tools](/blog/best-open-source-feature-flag-tools) and [open-source AB testing products](/blog/best-open-source-ab-testing-tools).

#### Strengths
- Easy to use and focused on essential web metrics
- Lightweight integration script won’t impact page performance
- No cookies required, GDPR compliant out of the box 

#### Open source license and monetization
Plausible Analytics is available under a AGPLv3 license and can be self-hosted via Docker Compose. Pricing for its hosted version starts at €9 per month for 10,000 monthly pageviews.

> **Also consider:** Plausible is one of a large subset of privacy-first analytics products that have proven popular in the wake of GDPR and less permissive attitudes to user tracking. [Umami](https://umami.is/) is another popular, open-source product in this space. Read our [GDPR analytics guide](/blog/best-gdpr-compliant-analytics-tools) for more options.

### Umami

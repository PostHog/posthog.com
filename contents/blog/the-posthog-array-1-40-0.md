### New: Redesigned calendar and date components

The 1.40.0 update is all about visual polish, and we're starting with new calendar and date components. These are some of the most used modals in PostHog, so we've given careful attention to providing an improved and more unified experience.

### New: Overhauled annotations

We've overhauled [annotations](/manual/annotations) with a new look and interface. This change resolves several layout and interaction issues that had previously been impacting annotations. We've also touched up the annotations page to highlight important information better!

### New: Revamped persons modals

![person modal](../images/blog/array/1-40-0-person-modal.png)

Clicking datapoints in an insight is one of our favorite ways to analyze the users behind the numbers. The new person modal now looks and feels like the rest of the app. We've made it easier for you to search and perform actions on those lists of users, too.

### New: Recordings domain settings

Struggling with keeping toolbar and recordings settings separate? Us too... That's why the settings for managing valid domains for recordings and toolbar are now split, so that they can be adjusted independently!

### Improved: Retention insight update

Once again, we've cleaned up the UI on the retention insight to keep up with all the styling updates we've had across the board. The end result is more consistent with the rest of our product, with lots of little touches which add visual flair and create an improved experience.

### Other improvements & fixes

Version 1.40 also adds hundreds of other improvements and fixes, including...

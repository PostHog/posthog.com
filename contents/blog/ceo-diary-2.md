Last week we had an offsite in the beautiful Portuguese countryside, an hour's bus journey from Porto. You should [watch the TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRUGX4XW/).

One of the sessions we ran was a PostHog pre-mortem. This involved breaking up into teams and getting people to suggest what is most likely to kill the company. What a cheerful way to start the week...

What surprised me was the number of people that listed cofounder breakup as a potential cause of failure.

And they're right.

Around [20% of the YC funded startups have a founder leave](http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html).

So, I took an action, as any good PostHog offsite attendee does, to cover what Tim and I are doing to not break up.

# We have reduced opportunities for things to get into a bad spiral

We talk frequently and at length:
- We talk 1/1 for at least an hour a week, although often, far more.
- We record any stuff we want to cover during the week in a shared agenda.
- We talk about frustrations / fears, as well as the positives.

We pay ourselves the same. Else it just creates a chance for resentment. Especially around equity.
- We have the same equity as each other.
- We are paid the same as each other.

We are clear who is doing what.
- There are a handful of things we _both_ want to be involved in. People is one, Strategy is another. We think both of us being involved leads to the best decisions here.
- Other things we have clear boundaries. Tim codes and works with engineering, I sell and work with design and our marketing team on positioning.

# Check you value the same things

It's tempting to claim we talked about this in advance (#visionaries), but we got lucky that we both heavily value many similar philosophies around work, which means we find it easy to work together.

In our case we like:

- speed
- individual contribution
- proactivity
- ambition
- a VC-backed approach
- giving people autonomy

We don't like:

- fluffy enterprise sales BS
- hypothetical plans where no one does anything
- meetings

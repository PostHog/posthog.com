***Software has eaten the world, and now we're drowning in data.***  
***I'm so sorry if you're a PostHog user. We're complicit – but I'm hoping we can make amends.***  
***We've been building for you.***

Today, I'm excited to announce the launch of **PostHog AI – the intelligence layer for product data**.

Cut the crap? Sure: **PostHog AI is an [AI agent](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/) built into PostHog, with access to your data and setup via tool use, working tirelessly in a loop until it achieves the task you give it.** Like a friendly product analyst, it creates multi-step analyses of product usage, it writes SQL queries, it sets up new feature flags and experiments, it digs into impactful errors - and more, all across PostHog.

Yes, investors _have_ been asking _"hey, are you AI-native?"_ We've tuned that noise out, then built out of genuine need. Here's why:

## The knowledge curse

The information age has been great – it's just also been _too much_. Too much information captured: business events, clicks, pageviews, feedback, entities, errors, entire user sessions. Of course you want to know all this - flying blind is a recipe for crashing hard. That's why we've built PostHog.

How much of that data are you able to convert into action? Time is a flat circle, and we're right back to the <abbr title="Business Intelligence, for the innocent">BI</abbr> meme of "actionable insights". Always just one excellent dashboard away from finding diamonds.

**The truth is, raw knowledge creates work.** Work of slicing and dicing, then work of actually doing something: you've got to identify the improvement, build it, roll it out, monitor if it's successful, rinse and repeat. It's tasks all the way down.

## The missing link

What PostHog has been from the beginning: a really damn good *knowledge layer*. A dozen tools in one, each capturing a different part of the user journey.

The _bottleneck_ in using this knowledge captured hasn't been presentation or querying. **It's been intelligence all along.** With LLMs we have, for the first time, intelligence on demand.

There's no waiting for AGI to be declared by a committee. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex – call them C4, because they've been explosive for software engineering already.

It's not the math exam skills tha make LLMs productive, but something even more human-like: the ability to achieve goals by stringing tools together one by one. The intelligence age is here, and we're here for it.

## Intelligence in practice

**"What changed across my product this week?"** PostHog AI examines your events, identifies the biggest shifts in user behavior, creates trend graphs, and explains the patterns. No more manually building twenty different queries to spot what you missed.

**"Find sessions where users dropped off during checkout."** It searches through your session replays, filters by the checkout funnel, identifies drop-off points, and summarizes the common patterns. What would take hours of manual review happens in minutes.

**"Create a dashboard for onboarding retention."** It builds the entire thing: retention cohorts, activation metrics, key user paths. All the insights you'd meticulously craft yourself, assembled and ready to monitor.

**"Set up an A/B test with 70/30 split for the new pricing page."** The feature flag appears, configured with your exact specifications. What used to require clicking through multiple screens and double-checking settings? Done in one prompt.

**"Which errors impact user sign-ups the most?"** PostHog AI correlates your error data with conversion events, ranks issues by impact, and surfaces the bugs actually hurting your business—not just the loudest ones.

This is intelligence put to work.

## Behind the scenes

Our number one learning: subagents are one dangerous idea, and full context makes all the difference. That's why we're rolling out PostHog AI as a single-loop agent that instead switches modes depending on the set of tools needed for the moment. We see this is as a temporary stepstone too – the advance in agentic capabilities we've seen first-hand in the last year has been staggering, and we expect frontier LLMs to be even more capable in the coming months.

In the coming weeks and months, we'll be sharing far more of what we've learned about building effective AI agents. Watch our engineering blog, and stay tuned.

## Up next

This is just the start. PostHog AI today handles the core workflows across the platform. What's coming: deep research capabilities, more sophisticated session analysis, proactive insights from background analysis, and tighter integration with development workflows.

## Get started now

PostHog AI is available for PostHog Cloud users. Open the AI chat in your PostHog project, grant access (requires admin permissions), run `/init`, and start asking it to do things.

The agent auto-detects what page you're on (dashboard, insight, session replay) and pulls in relevant data. You can manually add context: specific events, dashboards, or insights. It maintains a memory system (initialized via `/init`) with project-specific knowledge that persists across sessions.

The interface is a chat panel, but PostHog AI appears throughout the platform. See the sparkle icon ✨ when editing SQL, watching replays, or configuring filters? Same agent, contextually aware of what you're working on.

We've been using it ourselves for months while building it. The team asks it to debug SQL queries, investigate user behavior, set up experiments, analyze errors—anything that would normally require clicking through multiple screens or writing complex queries. It's become the first place we go when we need to understand what's happening in our product.

PostHog AI. For builders, from builders.

Features tell, benefits sell. Well, they used to.

Marketing lore tells you that you must focus on the _why_, not the what. "No one buys a CRM, they buy a way to increase their revenue" - that sort of thing.

I'm sure this worked great when it was invented. But now, it feels tired and out-of-touch. Developers seem especially sensitive to vague language when evaluating products.

It makes me feel like I'm being sold to, by someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.

Worse, benefits-heavy and feature-light language makes it hard to know what you're actually buying. I can evaluate for myself what benefits something brings, I want to see how it works, and how it compares to other products, instead.

Highlighting benefits makes sense, as a backup in case I don't get it. For executives who don't really use the software, and who certainly don't implement it - go nuts. For everyone else, benefits-oriented language is a poor user experience - it gets in the way of explaining the product.

Often, users _do_ know the product category they're interested in. I know, for example, the approximate benefits a CRM brings, and I want to choose one that suits my team particularly well. Otherwise I wouldn't have been looking for one in the first place. Show me how your features stack up. Please don't tell me you'll "drive gorwth with magical customer 360 experiences" (Salesforce's homepage today) - this doesn't help me compare you to your competitors, and it makes me feel like you value my wallet over my user experience.

### Improvement: Project Homepage Updates

[[TODO: screenshot goes here]]

[[TODO: @rcmarron Could you give a brief summary of the recent updates to project homepage that have been going on since the last version? Namely recently viewed persons, insights, and recordings.]]

### Other improvements & fixes
Version 1.35.0 also adds hundreds of other fixes and improvements, including...

- **Improved**: Warn before leaving insight with unsaved changes
- **Improved**: Redesigned funnels view
- **Improved**: More specific breadcrumbs
- **Improved**: Show "out-of-band" events in recordings

### Deprecation and removal notices
- Starting from PostHog 1.35.0 SAML will change from being instance-based to domain-based. This means that SAML configurations will take place in the PostHog UI. You will be able to have multiple SAML providers on the same instance (segment by domain, from the user's email address). Please review our [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.
- If you use SAML on a self-hosted instance and have enabled SAML enforcement (previously `SAML_ENFORCED` environment variable) then this environment configuration has been deprecated too. You will now need to configure SSO enforcement via Authentication domains (see [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.)

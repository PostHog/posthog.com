That’s right, we’re [teaming up with Altinity](https://altinity.com/blog/announcing-the-new-altinity-posthog-partnership). It’s an exciting new partnership that also marks the launch of the [PostHog Marketplace](/marketplace). Double announcement!

Going forward, the marketplace is where you’ll be able to find third-party services which layer on top of PostHog, such as companies offering support, integration or development services. Altinity is the first such company, but there are more to come in the future. 

You may know [Altinity](https://altinity.com/) as experts in all things ClickHouse and data infrastructure. That’s why we’re working with them! Going forward, Altinity will be offering a variety of services to help give large organizations on PostHog an increased level of support for self-hosted deployments.

This increased support includes:

- 24/7 technical support for ClickHouse in any environment
- Bespoke training for analytics developers and system administrators
- Altinity Stable builds for ClickHouse

In addition to providing training and support, Altinity can also offer [Altinity.Cloud as a backend](/docs/self-host/configure/using-altinity-cloud) for PostHog users who prefer a private cloud environment. This essentially means Altinity can manage your ClickHouse deployment for you, turning PostHog into a fully managed service.

We think this partnership with Altinity is exciting because, while self-hosted deployments offer many unique benefits — such as better data capture and [data control](/customers/vendasta) — they can also be challenging to set up and maintain. Altinity is the ideal middle ground, enabling you to retain full control over your data while experts manage your ClickHouse for you!

You can find out more about our partnership with Altinity in the PostHog marketplace, where we’ll soon add even more exciting partners to help you get even more from your PostHog deployment. Until then, we’d love to hear your feedback in [the community!](/questions)

> PostHog is an open source analytics platform you can host yourself. We help you build better products faster, without user data ever leaving your infrastructure.

## Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

### [New Navigation For All](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3167)

![New Nav](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/new-navigation.png)

While this might not be news to all of you, we have now released our new navigation to everyone.

We had this behind a feature flag, but now all our users have access to our fresh "spaceship-like" navigation. What do you think? 🚀

### [Refreshing Insights](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3144)

![Refreshing Insights](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/refreshing-insights.png)

To provide a smooth user experience, we cache query results so that you don't have to wait for a query to run every time you view a chart.

This has the side effect that sometimes you'll be looking at slightly outdated results. We made improvements to clearly indicate when you're looking at a cached result, when it was computed, and allow you to refresh.

### [Session Recording Filters](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/2993)

![Session filters](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/session-filters.png)

Our session recording filters just got **so much more powerful**. Filter by session duration, user properties, unseen recordings, actions performed in a session, and so much more.

You can now get a lot more out of your session recording sessions by tailoring the recordings to specific areas of your product you're looking into.

For a start, how about [integrating PostHog with Sentry](https://posthog.com/docs/libraries/sentry) and watching all recordings with an `$exception` event in them?

### [Multiple Groups in Feature Flags](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3030)

![Feature Flag Multiple Groups](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/feature-flag-groups.png)

Feature flags can now be rolled out to multiple different groups that use distinct settings, unlocking a whole new world of opportunities for your A/B testing and feature rollout processes.

For example, you can now roll out feature flags like this:

-   100% of users in the 'Beta Testers' cohort
-   40% of all your users
-   All users in a specific team that requested the feature from you

The filters and rollout percentages can be adjusted per group, giving you greater control degree of how you build and test your products.

### [A New Plugins UI with Brand New Features](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/2774)

![Apps UI](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/plugins-ui.png)

A lot has happened to our apps feature since the last release, including:

-   An improved UI
-   The ability to reorder apps
-   The ability to upgrade apps (and see exactly what changed between versions)
-   Autofill on commonly used app configuration fields
-   A new app configuration field type, letting app builders specify pre-determined choices for the user to select from
-   A ton of performance improvements

### [Taxonomy Standardizer](https://posthog.com/plugins/taxonomy-standardizer)

![Taxonomy Standardizer](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/taxonomy-plugin.png)

Standardize your event names into a single naming pattern by converting the names of your events that don't match your desired pattern into the chosen format, such as `camelCase` or `snake_case`.

### [Bitbucket Release Tracker (Beta)](https://posthog.com/plugins/bitbucket-release-tracker)

![Bitbucket App](https://github.com/PostHog/bitbucket-release-tracker/raw/main/readme-assets/release-tracker.png)

Get your Bitbucket release tags into PostHog as annotations on your graphs, so you can track the impact of releases on your metrics.

[Contact sales](/signup/self-host/get-in-touch?plan=enterprise#contact). That's the usual answer when you're trying to figure out how much a premium, or enterprise, product tier costs. 

Next, if you're deemed worthy enough for a sales rep to call you, it's highly likely you won't find out the pricing until you've answered a _lot_ of questions.

And maybe seen a demo.

And perhaps your own hands-on evaluation.  

And also introduced your bosses' boss. 

And consulted the finance deparment.

And don't forget the legal department.

And "hey, would you like to join our webinar?"

This is everything we hate about modern SaaS companies, so we found a better way.

We introduced transparent enterprise pricing.

## What do PostHog do, anyway?

We're an all-in-one product analytics suite which helps you replace siloed tools used for 
[Analytics](/product#product-analytics), [Heatmaps](/product/heatmaps), 
[Session recording](/product/session-recording) and [Feature flags](/product/feature-flags).  
The real value though is that you can self-host all of this inside your own environment meaning that your 
customer data never leaves your infrastructure.  Your compliance and legal teams will be very happy.

If you choose to self-host PostHog there are three main packaging [options](/pricing):

* **Open-Source** - Contains all of the base analytics features but is limited to 1 project
* **Scale** - Contains advanced features such as experiments and group analytics and has unlimited projects
* **Enterprise** - Comes with SAML-based SSO, project permissions and a whole lot of help from us

If self-hosting isn't your thing then our hosted Cloud options may be for you:

* **Cloud** - Mirrors the features of PostHog Scale, hosted by us
* **Cloud Enterprise** - Mirrors the features of PostHog Enterprise, hosted by us

##  Why did we implement transparent pricing?

At PostHog we pride ourselves on transparency.  We make our processes, policies, and team structure available for anyone
to read in our company handbook.  If you're interested in our Enterprise product then we are going to share pricing with
you eventually, why make you wait?  That's why today, for all of our product offerings, you can 
[calculate your price](/pricing) without speaking to us at all.

## How did we do it?

We found that quite a few people who were interested in PostHog Enterprise had already calculated a price using the 
Scale or Cloud pricing calculator which has been on our pricing page for a while.  PostHog Enterprise or Cloud Enterprise
will cost you more because you get more:

1. Integration with SAML-based SSO providers (security policies require these more often than not in Enterprise)
2. Project-based permissions (to keep projects private)
3. A lot of proactive help from us in deployment, tuning, maintenance and training

We adapted our existing pricing models to be roughly 2x Scale pricing for self-hosted Enterprise, and 1.3x Cloud pricing
for Cloud Enterprise to reflect the additional benefits you gain from these editions.  We didn't want to mandate lengthy
annual commitments, so all of our products can be subscribed to on a monthly basis and cancelled at any time.

That said, most larger organizations do fall into a traditional annual buying process and we are able to incentivize 
those with bigger discounts for the upfront commitment.

## What did we learn?

People expected pricing to be lower for self-hosted deployments as you incur the additional infrastructure 
costs. Whilst it's true that running PostHog Cloud requires a minimum level of spend from us, we see the ability to 
self-host (and all of the privacy benefits which come with it) as a premium feature which you don't get from most 
other product analytics vendors.

Furthermore, we are willing to invest a significant amount of our time in ensuring our large self-hosted 
deployments are tuned effectively so that our customers have the best PostHog experience possible.  
That's what you get when you become an Enterprise customer with us.

## Whatâ€™s next?

We are going to make it even easier to become an Enterprise customer with us - we are working on the ability to self-serve 
Enterprise sign-up and licenses.  We also want to make it easy for you to upgrade when you realise you need the 
additional features and benefits which Enterprise brings.  Until then though, you can still

Let me tell you a story of the financial pressures that face new founders and how that pressure motivated Tim and me to make an epic ~~pivot~~ [leap](https://posthog.com/blog/story-about-pivots), from bootstrapping to a VC-backed startup.

I began this journey because I had spent a lot of time in the world of enterprise software sales, and wanted to work on a product that could be adopted bottom up. I felt like it was the future of software, even that used by huge companies. I convinced Tim to join me with a slick prototype and confidence of a salesman that the product was pretty much done and ready to sell - so simple right! We both saved a year‚Äôs living costs and planned to build and launch for 6 months and then run for 6 months. We took the ‚Äúrisky‚Äù leap...

## Inflated risk seems riskier

Risk is different depending on your skills and experience. Take a look at the demand for your services on the open market. Will the market demand hold for a year or two? Do you have experience contracting or freelancing? If not, do your research and experiment so that you can find your true risk profile - it could be much lower risk than you think.

Tim and I both code but he‚Äôs the stronger developer so he went full-time and I negotiated to go part time 2 days a week. That money went straight into the business. I had a mortgage to pay and it minimized our shared risk and allowed us to get coworking space, pay for tools and ads without drawing on savings.

## You‚Äôll have to decide to bootstrap or go for VC

You can bootstrap and then raise venture capital but you can‚Äôt do it the other way around. We spent the first three months indie hacking and came to the conclusion that it was going to take years to get back to our pre-startup salaries, with a massive trench in the middle. No wonder why people advise bootstrapping as a side-gig ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So we got comfortable with doing something bigger and not owning the whole pie. Tim and I had been pushing for months and stopped to ask ourselves, if we continued on this path and were 80 years old, would we be happy with what we did in our career? We both said no, for us it was slow and dull. We decided to aim bigger and do something more exciting.

We reorganized everything around weekly product launches. Yes that‚Äôs right, not sprints, build and validate the product with 10-15 customers in a week. It sounds ludicrously outrageous, and it was. But demonstrating and giving access to a product rather than a landing page or mockups got us the high quality validation we needed to move on to the next idea. We got comfortable throwing out what we‚Äôd built - as clich√© as it sounds, the light bulb moment is realizing you never throw away the lessons. If you‚Äôd like more detail, I wrote more on [our time before YC](https://posthog.com/blog/before-yc).

## Spend early money, wisely

As conventional wisdom goes, we spent very little money in the early days. GitHub, AWS and Figma free tier were our bread and butter but it took longer to discover the true value of your time and how to spend it wisely.

Tim and I tried remote working, but found it difficult to be focused and in-sync with each other while rapidly prototyping. Getting cheap WeWork access ($100/month/person) was a game changer for us. We constantly pushed each other and tried to keep up with the other‚Äôs pace - plus all the free coffee we could drink!

While Tim was building products, I recruited users to validate them. It was manual and slow so I worked out the value of my time, and then spent that on ads to get weeks of users in a day. If you are in a similar situation, ask yourself if there are legitimate reasons to go slowly or are you artificially holding yourself back?

## Closing our first round

Both Tim and I wanted to get into YC from the moment we ditched bootstrapping. We reached out to our network and scoured the internet to gleam application strategies.

Many swung big in the hope of going viral, like a well-timed Show HN launch before the application. This felt too binary for us: you are either screwed or winning. Whereas if we thought of ways to get steadily users every week we'd have something real to talk about. We saw YC cared about speed and iteration, so we focused on doing what we are good at.

For most of our ideas we struggled to get and retain users. The idea we got into YC with was different, users were excited to join and stuck around. We doubled down on ads and by the time we applied we had 300 users and 600 by the interview - tt was important for us to show continued growth.

Small caveat: PostHog today is very different to what we applied to YC with. I feel this strategy worked for our self-serve dev tool, but it would have been harder for us today. If your product is closer to a tool/toy you can try this strategy.

## The night before

My enterprise sales and marketing years had cursed my writing style, long meaningless words kept creeping their way into our written application, so the night before the deadline, we threw everything out and made a video instead.

We brainstormed the least enterprise things we could do, pink Comic Sans typography and a generous amount of emojis seemed like the right course. Many takes later and delirium setting in, we produced these never-shared-before YC application and demo videos üôà If you can work out what Tim is saying in the first few seconds we‚Äôll send you some awesome swag.

## Ramen millionaire

Five months later, we got into YC and received the standard $120k cheque for 7%, valuing PostHot at ~$1.7M. If you were a solo founder, at this point you‚Äôd be technically a ‚Äúmillionaire‚Äù, whilst still eating ramen and scrambling for freebies. We still kept things very frugal during YC - your runway is determined by living costs. I sold my Jag and got a Mondeo and we tracked every penny in a spreadsheet. It had an odd familiarity to the very start of our journey, but with renewed and validated energy.

Applying to YC was a very challenging and stressful time and we‚Äôd like to help you have the best shot getting in. Join me, PostHog‚Äôs CEO, James Hawkins, for an [AMA on 16 March](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ama-with-posthogs-ceo-james-hawkins-tickets-144448466251) 16:30-17:15 GMT.

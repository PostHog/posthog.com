Want to understand how PostHog and Google Analytics 4 are different? Here's the short answer:

- **Google Analytics** is a web analytics tool to track and anaylze your website performance. It's built for marketers.

- **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform that *includes* web analytics, product analytics and a whole bunch more – like session replays, A/B testing, surveys, and feature flags. It's built for engineers and product teams.

TODO: In this post, we'll cover these differences in more detail, comparing features, pricing, reporting, integrations, and frequently asked questions about both.

## How is PostHog different to Google Analytics?

### 1. PostHog does more than analytics

[Analytics](/product-analytics) is a core part of our platform, but it's just one component in a set of important tools for product teams. PostHog enables you to collect feedback with [surveys](/surveys) **(TODO: surveys product page is still not live)**, understand user behavior with [session replays](/session-replay), test changes with [A/B tests](/ab-testing), and deploy changes with [feature flags](/feature-flags).

### 2. PostHog is built for engineers

Anyone can use PostHog – just [ask our marketing team](/blog/posthog-marketing) – but PostHog is designed to meet the needs of engineers. Our goal is to help developers [be better at product](/blog/helping-engineers-to-product).

### 3. PostHog is open source and transparent

PostHog is built with transparency at its core. We work in the open and give full access to our [source code](https://github.com/PostHog) and enable you to [build integrations](/docs/apps/build) and [other services](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server) on top of the product. You can even give feedback on [our public roadmap](/roadmap).

## PostHog and Google Analytics feature comparison

As explained above, PostHog offers a wider selection of features than Google Analytics, which focuses solely on web analytics.

It's one thing to build _something_, it's another to build something that _people want_.

## We started with a problem we'd had

We pivoted, a lot. We repeatedly set out to solve problems we'd had in our previous careers.

Every time we pivoted, we wanted to set up product analytics for the new piece of software we ended up working on.

These were our frustrations:

* We couldn't get to the underlying data, to debug
* Opaque pricing
* Sending our data to a 3rd party (privacy, and adblockers causing us to lose 50% of our data)
* We didn't want to have to set up the telemetry manually. We wanted to auto capture front end events.

So we solved the above with our initial launch on HN.

Since then, we got a lot of feedback to build the products next door to ours. The ones that have done best are the ones we've used ourselves, a lot.

## Do it for real

Even before launching, we focused on this loop:

* Give excited user access to new feature
* User users it and gives feedback
* Repeat

It is _much _ better to ship like this, rather than shipping in isolation. With this approach, what you build will be much more likely to work, and you'll gain a far deeper understanding of your customers too.

This _still_ applies. See our community roadmap idea - we're looking to go further with this.

## Make communication natural

Once we launched, we made it _very_ easy to get in contact.

Slack has worked well because:



There are some isseus (we did some cool things: Squeak!, to solve.)

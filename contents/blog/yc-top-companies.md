Y Combinator has [listed](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies) PostHog as number 157 out of its top 159 companies by valuations and exits as of July 2021.

## "Umâ€¦ what?"

I know, I know. You'd think we merely post the link and keep it moving. After all, coming third-to-last on a list of over 150 of _anything_ isn't really something to brag about, is it?

It actually is. YC have invested in over 3,000 startups - and they're widely seen as the best startup accelerator in the world. At PostHog, we've come a long way. From spending our first few months [pivoting](https://posthog.com/blog/story-about-pivots) from one idea to another, to [raising $15m](https://posthog.com/blog/why-we-raised-a-15m-series-b-ahead-of-schedule) in our Series B round after just ~1.5 years of operations, to planning to double our headcount to 47 by the end of 2021, our journey has been exhilarating, confusing, and supremely worthwhile. 

As an open-source company, we document everything we do on our [blog](https://posthog.com/blog), in our [company handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/story), and on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog). So it was only natural that we'd also want to document this achievement - as a reminder of how far we've come and where we're going.

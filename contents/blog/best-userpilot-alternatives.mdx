This simplifies workflows and ensures product data is in all one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Users appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever.

### How does Whatfix compare to Userpilot?

Whatfix is more of an enterprise tool than Userpilot is. It includes more tools for internal teams to use to increase adoption, but at a broad level, its feature set is very similar to Userpilot.

<ComparisonTable column1="Whatfix" column2="Userpilot">
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Trial only"} column2={false} feature="Self-serve" description="Free to try, no mandatory sales calls" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Custom events, trends, funnels, paths, and retention" />

> #### Bottom line

## 4. Chameleon

- **Founded:** 2015
- **Similar to:** Userflow, Pendo
- **Typical users:** Product managers and product marketers
- **Typical customers:** Growth-stage SaaS companies

### How does Chameleon compare to Userpilot?

The big advantage Chameleon has over Userpilot is that it is self-serve. Beyond this, it focuses on in-app engagement with tours, tooltips, and surveys, but lacks features like product analytics beyond these.

<ComparisonTable column1="Chameleon" column2="Userpilot">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Self-serve" description="Free to try, no mandatory sales calls" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Custom events, trends, funnels, paths, and retention" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Chameleon?

3. **Ease-of-use:** Chameleon's user interface makes it easy for all types of users to set up tours, tooltips, and the rest of what they offer. Non-technical users like how they don't need to code, but still can customize how features look.

> #### Bottom line
> If you are just looking for in-app engagement, Chameleon can be a good alternative to Userpilot. For teams looking for a broader range of features (like product analytics or session replay), there are better options.

## 5. Userflow

- **Founded:** 2019
- **Similar to:** Chameleon
- **Typical users:** Product marketers, managers, and founders
- **Typical customers:** Product-led startups

![Userflow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1714502568/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/best-userpilot-alternatives/userflow.png)

### What is Userflow?

Userflow is a user onboarding tool. It enables non-technical users to build customized in-app tours, checklists, surveys, and more without code. They were recently acquired by the user feedback tool Beamer.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Userflow), Userpilot is much more popular than Userflow. As of May 2024, only 21 of the top million sites use Userflow, while 556 use Userpilot.

#### Key features

- 🌊 **Flow builder:** A simple workspace to build onboarding flows easily. Connect multiple steps in their visual, no-code editor.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Get feedback from users and measure satisfaction with contextual and targeted surveys. Analyze responses in aggregate or per user.

- ✅ **Tasks:** Create onboarding checklists to anchor their experiences. Guide users through the app and automatically mark them complete when done.

- 📚 **Resource center:** Access helpful content directly in your app. Add search, contextualization, and even live chat.

### How does Userflow compare to Userpilot?

Like Chameleon, Userflow is a more focused alternative to Userpilot. This means it has the in-app engagement tools like product tours and surveys, but misses out on broader product tools like product analytics. 

<ComparisonTable column1="Userflow" column2="Userpilot">
  <ComparisonRow column1={"Trial only"} column2={false} feature="Self-serve" description="Free to try, no mandatory sales calls" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Custom events, trends, funnels, paths, and retention" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="In-app engagement" description="Engage with users through product tours, tooltips, and popups" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Surveys" description="Collect feedback and run satisfaction surveys" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users on your site; discover friction points" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Mobile support" description="Pre-built SDKs and support for iOS, Android, and React Native" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={"$749/m plan"} feature="EU hosting" description="Store your data in the EU for compliance" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Userflow?

Based on G2 reviews, users choose Userflow for:

1.**Pre-built components:** Users like the range of components and interactive features that they can use to drive engagement.

2. **Ease-of-use:** Userflow has an easy-to-use UI. Non-technical users appreciate how easy it is to create flows that once needed code to build and customize.

3. **Focus:** Where competitors are broad, multi-product platforms, Userflow focuses on entirely on onboarding. Users appreciate this specificity. 

> #### Bottom line
> For teams looking specifically to improve their product's onboarding, Userflow can be a good alternative. For teams also looking to improve their product beyond onboarding, there are likely better options.

## 6. WalkMe

- **Founded:** 2011
- **Similar to:** Whatfix
- **Typical users:** HR, IT, and training teams
- **Typical customers:** Enterprises with large staffs like consultancies, healthcare, and sales

Common uses include helping sales teams navigate a CRM like Salesforce, HR teams to onboard with Workday, or support teams to resolve issues with ServiceNow.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/WalkMe), as of May 2024, 1,014 of the top 1 million websites deploy WalkMe. This is nearly double Userpilot's 556. Again, this likely undercounts internal usage.

- 🏗️ **Workflows:** Automate common tasks, and help employees save time with repetitive tasks.

- 🤝 **Integrations:** Integrate with Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, and more to speed up adoption and automate workflows.

### How does WalkMe compare to Userpilot?

WalkMe is much more focused on internal tools. It includes most of the key features of Userpilot but built for adoption within an organization.

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use WalkMe?

According to G2 reviews, users like WalkMe the most for:

1. **A strong support team:** Quick-to-reply support team helps users solve their problems fast and make full use of the platform.

2. **Easy content creation:** The basics of WalkMe are quick to get started with. Users like that they can set up customized guidance content quickly.

3. **Analytics:** Support and HR teams value the metrics WalkMe provides about interactions with applications and the time it saves. This enables them to know what applications are important, confusing, or underused.

> #### Bottom line

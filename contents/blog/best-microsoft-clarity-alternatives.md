### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us ðŸ‘‹) is an open-source platform that combines session replay, product analytics, feature flags, A/B testing, and user surveys into one product.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Microsoft Clarity (session replay), [Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4), [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) (feature flags and A/B testing), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get an additional $50k in credits.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Clarity replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want more than basic session replay and analysis tools. We offer everything in one.
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

Check out [our product pages](/product-analytics) and [read our docs](/docs) to learn more.

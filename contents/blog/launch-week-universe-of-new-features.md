PostHog made huge strides in 2021. To name just a few landmarks, we: 

- Raised a [$15 million Series B ahead of schedule](/blog/why-we-raised-a-15m-series-b-ahead-of-schedule)
- Became one of [YC's top-valued companies](/blog/yc-top-companies)
- Rebranded our website [in just four weeks](/blog/postmortem-rebrand)
- Migrated from [postgresql to ClickHouse](/blog/how-we-turned-clickhouse-into-our-eventmansion)
- Achieved product market fit for PostHog Scale

All of this (and more) lead to huge growth. Users grew by 4x, the number of open source contributors doubled and we acquired [numerous reference customers](/customers).

As an open-source product, we're also delighted to see huge growth in [our Slack community](/slack) - now at over 2,000 members - and GitHub stars, which now stand at over 7,000.

But this is just the beginning. We've also been busy making PostHog a broader and more powerful tool for making great products. 

To celebrate, starting next week on Monday, March 21 we'll be officially launching a new feature or initative every day for a week.

Here's a quick teaser for what's to come during _PostHog Launch Week I: A Universe of New Features_.

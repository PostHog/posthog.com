PostHog made huge strides in 2021. To name just a few landmarks, we: 

- Raised a [$15 million Series B ahead of schedule](/blog/why-we-raised-a-15m-series-b-ahead-of-schedule)
- Became one of [YC's top-valued companies](/blog/yc-top-companies)
- Rebranded our website [in just four weeks](/blog/postmortem-rebrand)
- Migrated from [postgresql to ClickHouse](/blog/how-we-turned-clickhouse-into-our-eventmansion)
- Achieved product market fit for PostHog Scale

All of this (and more) lead to huge growth. Users grew by 4x, the number of open source contributors doubled and we acquired [numerous reference customers](/customers).

But this is just the beginning. We've also been busy making PostHog a broader and more powerful tool for making great products. 

To celebrate, we're officially launching a new feature or initative every day this week. Welcome to _PostHog Launch Week I: A Universe of New Features_.

## Chapter I: Data Management

- **Starring:** Alex Kim
- **Introducing:** New Data Management UI, event definitions, definition tagging and many more

As the biggest dogfooder of our own product, we were beginning to see the consequences of the lack of in-house tools to manage our data. All the use cases we saw boiled down to a few common pain points:

1. It is hard to understand events, actions, and properties that you yourself didn't set up.
2. Data decays quickly, and most of the time fails to stay up-to-date with instrumentation.
3. Event-level context in insights and dashboards is difficult to share with external people and new team members.

We set out to solve these pain points and the result is the new Data Management experience we're introducing today on PostHog Cloud and on Thursday for self-hosted.

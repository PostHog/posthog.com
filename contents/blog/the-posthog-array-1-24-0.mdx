## PostHog 1.24.0 Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

### [GeoIP for all](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3894)

![GeoIP](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/geoip.png)

Apps are now live on PostHog Cloud, and, as a bonus, we have now added out-of-the-box support for the PostHog GeoIP enricher, which adds location properties to your events, such as country and city, as well as a dozen other values!

The app works on both cloud and self-hosted installations (`1.24.0` minimum).

### [New 'Cohorts' tab on person pages](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3744)

![Cohorts tab](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/person-cohorts.png)

When viewing a person's page in PostHog, you can now toggle between a view of their properties and a view of the cohorts this person is in, giving you a lot more context on the user you're looking at.

### [Toolbar support for custom data attributes](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3761)

![Data attr](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/data-attr.png)

To make the experience of using the PostHog toolbar better, we have recommended that you set `data-attr` on your elements, so that the toolbar can leverage it for finding elements. However, since a lot of our users already used their own data attributes, we now support adding a list of your own data attributes for the toolbar to look for.

You can configure this in 'Project Settings'.

### [Dashboard collaboration features](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3756)

![Dashboard collab](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/dashboard-collab.png)

Our dashboards keep getting better with every new release, and this one is no different!

Dashboards now support descriptions and tags, making it easier for teams to collaborate when creating internal analytics reports.

These are enterprise features available to our paying Cloud customers, and to enterprise self-hosted users.

If you're interested in having these features on your self-hosted PostHog instance, contact us on <i>sales@posthog.com</i>.

### [S3 and Snowflake export apps](/plugins)

We have new apps to send PostHog events to [S3 buckets](/plugins/s3-export) and [Snowflake](/plugins/snowflake-export) instances!

You have Marius to thank for these - and you really should. Our resident progressive urbanite had to work hard to get around [all sorts of hurdles](https://github.com/PostHog/snowflake-export-plugin#temporary-tables) to get these out.

The apps work on both PostHog Cloud and self-hosted installations (`1.24.0` minimum) - [check it out here](/plugins/s3-export).

### [Session recording for heavy websites](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3705)

If you tell Karl you found an issue with session recording, he will fix it.

Such was the case with session recording for heavy websites (e.g. those with a lot of images/CSS). We were failing to process large snapshots, leading users of these websites unable to get many session recordings.

This is now fixed - expect a lot more recordings available to you from now on!

### [New configuration options for posthog-js](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/209)

Following user requests, there are now 10 new config options for `posthog-js`, allowing you to use autocapture with greater privacy for your users, as well as tailor session recording configuration.

The new options are:

-   `mask_all_text`: Specifies if PostHog should capture the `textContent` of autocaptured elements
-   `mask_all_attributes`: Specifies if PostHog should capture the attributes of autocaptured elements
-   `session_recording`: Accepts an object that lets you configure the following `rrweb` options:
    -   `blockClass`
    -   `blockSelector`
    -   `ignoreClass`
    -   `maskAllInputs`
    -   `maskInputOptions`
    -   `maskInputFn`
    -   `slimDOMOptions`
    -   `collectFonts`
    -   `recordCanvas`

See our [JS library page](/docs/integrate/client/js) for more details.

### [Track session starts](/plugins/first-time-event-tracker)

Our First Time Event Tracker now also tracks session starts. By enabling it you will get `session_started` events in PostHog, as well as events that started a session will be tagged with property `is_first_event_in_session` set to `true`.

## Share your feedback

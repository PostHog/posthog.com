## PostHog 1.24.0 Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/configuring-posthog/upgrading-posthog).


### New 'Cohorts' tab on person pages

![Cohorts tab](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/person-cohorts.png)

When viewing a person's page in PostHog, you can now toggle between a view of their properties and a view of the cohorts they belong to, giving you a lot more context on the user you're looking at.

[Pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3744).
[Cohort documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/features/cohorts).


### Toolbar supports custom search data attributes

![Data attr](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/data-attr.png)

The PostHog Toolbar is like a browser inspector for your data to view and edit actions, events and more. To give you more control over how the PostHog Toolbar searches for elements, you can now configure a list of data attributes to search for in ‘Project Settings’.

[Pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3761).
[Toolbar documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/features/toolbar).


### Dashboard collaboration features

![Dashboard collaboration](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/dashboard-collab.png)

Dashboards now support descriptions and tags, making it easier for teams to collaborate when creating internal analytics reports.

This is an premium feature available to paying Cloud customers and enterprise self-hosted users.

If you're interested in these features for self-hosted PostHog, contact [sales@posthog.com](mailto:sales@posthog.com).

[Pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3756).
[Dashboard documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/features/dashboards).


### Session recording for heavy websites

[Karl](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team#karl-aksel-puulmann-software-engineer) dove into the depths of Session Recording to debug issues users were having on heavy websites (e.g. those with a lot of images/CSS). He emerged victorious and PostHog can now handle session recording for even the most demanding web apps and sites.

[Pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3705).
[Session Recording documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/features/session-recording).


### More configuration options for posthog-js

Following user requests, we added 10 new config options for the posthog-js integration to give you more control over [Autocapture](https://posthog.com/docs/integrations#autocapture) privacy and [Session Recording](https://posthog.com/docs/features/session-recording).

The new options are:

- `mask_all_text`: Specifies if PostHog should capture the `textContent` of autocaptured elements
- `mask_all_element_attributes`: Specifies if PostHog should capture the attributes of autocaptured elements
- `session_recording`: Accepts an object that lets you configure the following `rrweb` options:
    - `blockClass`
    - `blockSelector`
    - `ignoreClass`
    - `maskAllInputs`
    - `maskInputOptions`
    - `maskInputFn`
    - `slimDOMOptions`
    - `collectFonts`

[Pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js/pull/209).
[JavaScript Integration documentation](/docs/integrations/js-integration).


### Plugins available in PostHog Cloud

[Plugins](https://posthog.com/plugins/) are now live on PostHog Cloud. This is massive milestone and months of work by [Marius](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team#marius-andra-software-engineer), [James G](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team#james-greenhill-software-engineer) and many others in the Extensibility Team.

[Plugin documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/plugins/overview).


### PostHog GeoIP plugin for all

![GeoIP](https://posthog-static-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Website-Assets/Array/geoip.png)

Our [PostHog GeoIP plugin](https://posthog.com/plugins/geoip) adds location properties to events such as country, city, and a dozen other useful values.

We now include a bundled location database so that you don't have to upload your own and can get up and running even faster.

The PostHog GeoIP plugin works on PostHog Cloud and self-hosted installations (1.24.0 minimum).

[Pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/3894).


### S3 and Snowflake export plugins

We have new plugins to send PostHog events to [S3 buckets](https://posthog.com/plugins/s3-export) and [Snowflake](https://posthog.com/plugins/snowflake-export) instances!

You have PostHog's "best dad joke teller" (Marius) to thank for this. He had to work hard to get around [all sorts of hurdles](https://github.com/PostHog/snowflake-export-plugin#temporary-tables) to build them.

Both plugins are available for PostHog Cloud and of course self-hosted installations (`1.24.0` minimum).


### Track session starts

Our [First Time Event Tracker plugin](https://posthog.com/plugins/first-time-event-tracker) now tracks session starts.

Enabling the plugin will give you `session_started` events, and the first event of each session will be tagged with the `is_first_event_in_session` property set to `true`.


## User Interviews

We’re working hard to improve PostHog and would love to talk to you about your experience with the product.

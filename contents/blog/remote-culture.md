2020 has been a tough year. 

Both in our personal and professional lives, we were all forced to make adjustments. Some small, some big.

For many companies that can afford to do so, 2020 has become the year of "work from home". 

A quote from an acquaintance of mine, an executive at a large European firm, sums it up quite well:

<blockquote class="blog-quote">

For a long time we discussed a day of work from home for a select group of employees. Now, we had to put the majority of the workforce on remote work overnight.

</blockquote><br />

Remote work is nothing new. In fact, it has been increasing steadily in popularity over the last decade, as the world continues to become increasingly connected by the internet.

<br />


However, many have now been "forced" to learn about it, and more, have to actually implement it. 

So, given that our team combined has a few decades of remote work experience, and we're in the process of figuring out our own remote culture here at PostHog, we thought we'd share some of what we learned along the way.

This is by no means an objective list, and far from a tutorial. Rather, it is a compilation of lessons we've learned as an all-remote company, as we continue to try to strengthen that culture ourselves.

So here are some points we find important, in no particular order of importance.

## Socializing

<br />

<br />


When you work with a team in an office, you're able to chat with people throughout the day, make jokes during a coffee break, and go out for beers after a long day. 

And even if your team does not socialize much after-hours, the slightest social interactions with individuals around us are often biologically good for us. They make us feel better.

When you're all-remote, well, that's not a thing. As such, you have to make up for it somehow. 

At PostHog, we're actually still trying to figure this part out, but we've introduced some concepts that have been extremely helpful:

#### Life Story Fridays
Every Friday, someone from the team shares their life story with everyone else. This is a great way to know who you're working with beyond the professional level, as well as learn some cool things about your teammates along the way. For example, we just recently found out one of our developers ranks in the top 5 for Pi digit memorization in the UK. 

#### Virtual Coffee

We added a bot to our Slack group that will pair you with a random person every other week for a virtual coffee. The bot also simplifies the scheduling to just a few clicks, and you're encouraged to not talk about work at all during this meeting. This is a great way to create connections with specific individuals, instead of just the team as a whole.

#### #random

Having a medium for talking about anything and everything unrelated to work is essential. Not only that, taking some time during the workday to actually engage in some "pointless" discussion should actually be encouraged, rather than looked down upon. In our case, that happens in the #random Slack channel, where conversation topics range from cool trips to cute hedgehog GIFs. This is our remote equivalent of water cooler talk. 

#### Offsites
Meeting in person is still important even if you check all the boxes in virtual socializing, so make sure you schedule a team trip somewhere once in a while. This is hard to organize during a pandemic (we'll tell you), but it's something you should consider as an all-remote company.

## Flexibility

<br />

![Slack do not disturb](../images/blog/remote-culture/do-not-disturb.png) 

<br />

Don't closely monitor exact working hours.

For some businesses, specific working hours are essential. In that case, this point can safely be ignored. If you're running a call center remotely, or trading within stock market hours, you might just need your workforce to be logged in and actively working specific hours.
However, if your business allows it, you should embrace asynchrony. Or at least that's what works for us.

Companies transitioning into a remote-first approach often question how it will impact their productivity. It's almost immediately assumed that people will be less efficient. 

As a result, many companies try to solve this "issue" by extensively tracking their employees. However, we strongly disagree with this approach. 

Aside from the fact that employee tracking software tracks much more than just hours (which is concerning from a privacy perspective), the simple concept of tracking hours instead of output creates a suboptimal workplace, with little confidence in the employees, and with priorities often upside down.

We recognize that keeping productivity high can be difficult, but there are many better solutions to the problem than tracking. 
Here are some concepts that work for us:

#### Daily standups
Every day we have a standup where one primary goal is to go over what each of us has done in the current workday. As we're still relatively small (about a dozen people), our standups currently include everyone. This means you need to tell the entire company what you've been working on, which is a great motivator to get stuff done. 

#### Weekly one-on-ones
On a weekly basis (minimum), we all have a 1:1 meeting with our "direct manager". At our current scale, this means the founders. In this session, we go over how the previous week went, and what the plans are for the upcoming week. In discussing what we've done, we also get indirect and direct feedback on performance, which helps keep everyone on track. If you're not finishing the tasks you've set out to do, a program won't flag you up, but someone will call you out.

#### Transparency 
Most of our work goes through GitHub one way or another. PostHog is open source, so we're committing code daily that is out in the open for anyone to look through. Additionally, a lot of our day-to-day is based on issues opened on GitHub, which people are assigned to (by they themselves or other team members). Hence, if you're not completing tasks you're assigned to, not only your whole team, but the whole world will be able to see. 

#### Trust

Above everything else is trust. You should trust that your team will do what needs to be done, and this starts with the hiring process. If you really want to build an all-remote company, it's important to look for profiles of people who are proactive and comfortable with working at a good pace from home (or a cafe in Bali). By trusting your team to get work done and just keeping an eye on output, you can ensure efficiency without tracking hours at all. This is especially important if you have a team in different time zones, as well as it helps accommodate for people who prefer to work different hours. If they're getting their work done and keeping up with team communication, who cares if they work 8–4 or 9–5?

## Communication 

<br />

![GitHub Chat](../images/blog/remote-culture/github-chat.png) 

<br />

Communication lies at the heart of just about everything concerning remote work.

Since you can't directly see people and talk to them in person, it's essential that you have great communication, both from a perspective of "workplace" wellbeing, as well as productivity. 

Communication is a broad topic, but there are three points that are part of our values which I'd like to briefly expand upon:

#### Asynchronous Communication
If possible, structure your company to use as much asynchronous communication as possible. 

This means people shouldn't rely on getting an immediate response from someone else in order to do their work. In our case, most of our communication happens openly on GitHub. This is great because each conversation occurs within a specific context (e.g. of an issue or PR) and all the information needed to discuss the topic should be readily available within that context. Additionally, people aren't pressed to reply immediately, and will get to it when they get to it (sometimes with a little nudge).

At PostHog, for example, we don't send internal emails. 99% of the time, we're talking on GitHub, Slack, or a call. We also mostly use Slack for non-work-related, private, and more urgent conversations. If it doesn't fit those categories, chances are it could be on GitHub.

#### Transparency
Transparency means that if some information or a particular conversation can be public, we should try to make it public. 

This way, we create an ever-growing record of things that have been previously discussed, questions that have been asked, and answers that have been found. 

As such, when someone needs some info, they don't need to message a team member to get what they need. They can just find it immediately. 
We extend this concept quite deeply, having our entire [Company Handbook](/handbook) public, which outlines things like how we do sales calls, our approach to talking to investors, and how we hire people. As such, if there's ever a question about how we operate as a company, referring to the handbook will usually get you the answer. 

Additionally, our massive backlog of issues and pull requests also contains very useful information regarding how we've come to certain decisions, from engineering to marketing. 

#### Written Communication
Underpinning the aforementioned points is our preference for written communication. 

At PostHog, a large part of our async and transparent culture is underpinned by written communication, so I'll keep this section short. It's worth briefly mentioning a few points about how written communication helps us, however:

* **Faster:** If something doesn't need to be a call, it shouldn't be a call. Calls are great for the social aspect they bring, but for day-to-day work, they often are a slower process for making decisions, given that they include small-talk, internet issues, and scheduling difficulties. Communicating via writing can help save time.
* **Referenceable:** Unless you record all your calls, chances are you might forget something that was discussed in a meeting. However, by trying to write instead of calling, and taking notes when we do call, we can always refer back to what was discussed and easily expand on the discussion later on.
* **Clearer:** Writing something out requires some effort to communicate your point of view effectively. As such, writing can help you distill your thoughts into concrete points, as well as present these points to others in a more solid way. 

## Pull Requests > Issues

<br />

![GitHub PR](../images/blog/remote-culture/github-pr.png) 

<br />

If you're not a software developer, the term pull request (PR) might not anything to you. In short, pull requests are a way of submitting a contribution to a software project. 

Most software projects have some sort of development workflow analogous to the following structure:
1. An issue is raised / A ticket is opened for a feature request or a bug that has been found
1. Someone picks up that issue to work on (either voluntarily or by being assigned to it)
1. The assigned person submits a pull request solving (closing) the issue, with the needed modifications to the software

At PostHog, we operate much in the same way.

However, we try our best to create a culture of submitting pull requests over opening issues. 

The idea is, if you find a bug that needs fixing, or want to build a new feature, if you can do it without much work, you should just do it.
Rather than opening a ticket for someone else to handle, just pick it up on the spot and fix it. 

This requires a culture of flexibility, where people's work is allowed to diverge based on what ideas they have or issues they encounter throughout the day. 

However, with such a culture in place, you build a team of doers who are consistently pushing product quality and willing to help out with things outside of their official job description.

## Ship, Iterate, Ship

<br />



When you're working with a remote team, especially one distribute across timezones, it can be difficult to get things done fast if they rely on more than one person's work.

For this reason, we believe in asynchrony, as mentioned before, but also the concept of shipping whenever (post) if it makes sense. 

The idea is: you've done some work, either individually or as a team, and it feels like it is ready to be published, even if it's not perfect. Well, just ship it. 

This can mean a blog post, a tweet, or a new software version. If a failure wouldn't have massive consequences, just put out your work. Once it's live, you can review it, gather feedback, and improve upon it. 

At PostHog, on a small scale, this means not waiting for our designer to make an amazing blog illustration to put our a new post, or waiting for QA to change a typo on the website. On a larger scale, it can also mean not waiting for a feature to be perfect to launch it to our users. 

The key to this is a culture of iteration, as well as giving the team a sense of autonomy and responsibility. You should always aim to unblock yourself if you feel it's right and can do it without serious negative consequences.

## Diversity

<br />

![Dakar Couchsurf](../images/blog/remote-culture/dakar-couchsurf.png) 

<br />

If you're building an all-remote team, you should embrace the opportunity for building a diverse team that it offers you. 

Sure, there can be various benefits to remote work even if everyone works from home around the same region, but the ability to tap into talent from various places in the world is definitely a big plus.

Aside from the fact that you have access to a much broader talent pool, building an all-remote team across countries gives you the unique chance to get people on board who have distinct backgrounds, speak different languages, and most importantly: think differently.

If you want to innovate, it's important to be exposed to multiple perspectives, and there are few better ways to do so professionally than hiring people from various corners of the Earth.

At PostHog, for example, we currently have people based in the US, Brazil, England, Senegal, Belgium, Estonia, Germany, and many other countries. As a result, we consistently get exposed to perspectives we may not have come across before, and as a result, we grow both as individuals and as a company. 

Oh, and everything becomes more fun, especially when you get to hear people's stories…

## Is remote for you? 🤔
As important as all the points above are, if you're looking to build an all-remote company or team, the number one question you need to answer is: _Is it for you?_

For many, that answer will be no. That can be a matter of bureaucracy, the type of business you run, or your personal preferences regarding how to build a strong team. 

At the end of the day, running a company entirely remotely is not just a new methodology or approach that can easily be introduced or removed. 

Indeed, the pandemic has shown us that we are able to adapt and spin up a new way of working overnight, however, in the long-run, being remote is a defining characteristic of an organization with various implications - good and bad.

For us, remote is built into our DNA, and it has helped us bring in an amazing team (link) and keep our product improving at a fast pace.
 
We believe remote is the future. But if you're going to try it, just remember to embrace it in full and do it for the right reasons, not just because of the savings from ditching the office.

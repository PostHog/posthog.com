Following our largest release to date, we are now back on a more regular release schedule. And, given that scalability was the focus of the previous release, we thought it was time for some fresh new features. 


So, without further ado, here they are:

## Release Notes

> If you're self-hosting and want to upgrade for a better experience with nicer features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/runbook/upgrading-posthog).

### [Session Recording (Beta)](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/1846)

![Session Recording Page Screenshot](../images/blog/array/session-recording.png)

Given that our mission at PostHog is to increase the number of successful projects in the world, session recording felt like a feature that fits in perfectly with that goal.

PostHog already provides various features to help you understand and improve your UX - but watching real users use your product is a _whole other ball game_. 

With PostHog's session recording, you are able to truly feel the pain points of your users first-hand, seeing where they get stuck, debugging exceptions faster, and making your UX smoother. 

![Session Recording Screenshot](../images/blog/array/session-recording-ss.png)

Additionally, you can do so while still preserving the privacy of your users, by determining what shouldn't be captured, as well as being able to turn session recording on and off as you wish.

However, please note that our session recording feature is in **Beta** at the moment. This means that it can be unstable and have bugs. To report bugs you find while using it, please [open an issue for us on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues). 


### [Apps (Beta)](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/1896)

![Apps Screenshot](../images/blog/array/plugins.png)

Apps is another **Beta** feature that we're extremely excited for. Currently only available for self-hosted instances, apps allow you to add additional logic to your event processing pipeline, in order to do things like enrich your data or send it somewhere else, like a data warehouse. 

At the moment, we have created a few example apps for you to test out the functionality, and have the intention of launching more for the next release. We will also be launching tutorials on how to make your own apps, so stay tuned for that.

As of right now, if you're on a self-hosted instance, you should head over to 'Project' -> 'Apps' to enable the functionality. You can start testing it out with our "Hello World" app, which adds a property to your events called `foo` with a value that is up to you to decide in setup. 

We also have built apps for currency normalization and GeoIP data, allowing you to convert currency values in events according to up-to-date exchange rates and determine the location of an event based on the user's IP.

Our overall vision for apps is to enable seamless integration with other relevant data analytics platforms, as well as allow users to more easily customize PostHog's functionality by adding their own logic and data to the event pipeline.

Finally, as is the case with session recording, please report any bugs in the functionality on [GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues).


### [Multiple Projects](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/1562)

![Multiple Projects Screenshot](../images/blog/array/org-project.png)

You asked and we delivered!

As per feedback from many in our community, PostHog now offers support for managing multiple projects under one "umbrella" organization. 

This allows you to segregate concerns, such as keeping tracking for your dev and prod environments separately, as well as track multiple domains and apps without mixing data.  

In addition, we also enhanced our invite and permissioning system as a by-product of this feature. 

As this is an Enterprise Edition feature, please contact us at _[sales@posthog.com](mailto:sales@posthog.com)_ if you are interested in using it.

### [Dashboard Templates](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/1942)

![Dashboard Templates Screenshot](../images/blog/array/dashboard-template.png)

In order to make it easier to create valuable dashboards to keep track of your business metrics, PostHog now offers the option to create new dashboards based on a template. We will be expanding the power of dashboard templates, but, as of right now, you can already create a dashboard using our web app dashboard template, which provides you with a good starting point for determining and tracking relevant metrics.

### [Setup Improvements](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/1990)

![Google Login Screenshot](../images/blog/array/google-login.png)

In addition to GitHub and GitLab authentication, PostHog now supports signup and login with Google accounts! 

We also improved our setup process by better structuring our settings pages, allowing you to [change your project's token](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/2015), and [enhancing the UX for empty states on dashboards](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/2068).

### [Documentation Level Up](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com)

![Docs Screenshot](../images/blog/array/docs.png)

We have been working hard to improve our product documentation and had a few big upgrades recently:

- Our Docs now have a Dark Mode option
- You can search our entire documentation without ever using your mouse
- We are actively releasing new tutorials on how to use PostHog to track key metrics and improve your product
- Our Docs pages now load faster
- New screenshots have been added throughout the Docs, as well as functionality walkthrough videos

...and a lot more!

If you have any suggestions for new tutorials or improvements to our documentation, [do not hesitate to let us know!](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues)

## Favorite Issue

### [Apps Epic](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/1896)

Originally built over the span of a few days at an internal hackathon, our apps feature has since undergone massive refactors and improvements. 

As a result, the linked issue has the following gem, as well as an in-depth discussion (AKA monologue) about the implementation, which is extremely informative:

## PostHog News

Charles joined our ops team to fix anything and everything that has ever been broken at PostHog. Akin to a mythical creature, he puts out fires on our ops roadmap, handles our Fax division, and even submits pull requests (see: [everyone codes](/handbook/company/values#everyone-codes)).

Even more importantly, pineapples are 404 on Charles' pizzas, making him an illustrious member of the "common sense" group of the PostHog core team. The number of people who appreciate a good pizza has now decidedly surpassed the number of Estonians in the company (3-2).

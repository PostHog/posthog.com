[YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) (YC) is seen as the world's best, and most prolific, 3 month accelerator program. Upwards of 7,000 founders have taken part. Yet, no one really talks about what happens afterwards.

> PostHog did YCombinator's Winter 2020 batch. We made the top companies list a year later when we closed a series B led by YC Continuity. We provide an open source product analytics suite.

So, what have the last two (and a bit) years like been for us, and how could they have been better?

## The network

It's a vague term, what does this _actually_ mean?

The tools we have are an internal forum, dozens of unofficial YC Whatsapp/Slack groups filled with other founders, regular invites to informal in person events, and the contact details of all the partners and every founder. This extends to real life - we met many people there that are now good friends.

Ultimately, all these new contacts gave us access to many of the best founders and investors in the world. This was critical to us - as Silicon Valley outsiders, we really knew no one before we started with YC. This helped us to meet people for advice, angel investors and a few funds.

A benefit of many networks is emotional support, but being closely connected to other founders in particular can provide the opposite depending on how you react. When we were very small, we benefited greatly from [talking to founders or senior people at successful developer-focussed](a-chat-with-sid) [companies](ceo-diary-4#hiring-the-right-people--what-stripe-taught-me
). At other times, we've seen people we know well create multi billion dollar companies from scratch, faster than us. We should take lessons from them, but shouldn't blindly raise money as fast as possible to compete on valuation.

The network brings customers. From time to time, the founder of a growth stage company will find and message us because of YCombinator. We're 100% inbound, but YC companies that do outbound sales potentially benefit even more from all these warm connections. We even started giving out [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/) / [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) to YC companies that pick us over our competitors - it was very profitable as a fraction of them convert to paying customers when they grow.

Finally, it helped us get to product market fit sooner. YC founders tend to give better (more direct) feedback when things aren't working, and are naturally a little more understanding. An amusing example of this was when we once signed up [Eric Migicovsky](https://twitter.com/ericmigi?lang=en) (Pebble founder / YC partner and now founder of [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/)) - a year ago, he gave us so much direct feedback including "throw out your current interface" (I removed context for dramatic effect - he was very polite and constructive!) that it made us realize, at that time, we didn't have strong product market fit in his segment.

## Investor reviews

YC has a database that provies anonymized investor reviews written by founders about their experiences during fundraising. The fact this comes from within a trusted network means it'd be hard to replicate something from outside.

It was crucial to us in raising a seed round - we didn't know anyone and used it to build trust and to figure out who had the best reputation.

Now, as a post series B company, this has gone from critical to slightly useful. It still provides another way to background check potential investors - although it doesn't have as much relevant data... There are naturally way fewer reviews of later stage investors.

## Office hours

During the YC batch, every company is offered office hours. These

Quite simply, this continues afterwards.

The partners' experience varies a lot. Many of the longer term partners are world experts in getting to product market fit - they have seen more people than anyone else do this. Many have worked with several hundred companies.

The quantity of partners that can deliver relevant advice to scaling is lower - scaling PostHog is quite different to scaling supersonic air flight . However, there *are* many visiting partners that will meet with you - they bring deeper operating experience.

It's very normal to do way fewer office hours when you're later. Early on, you'll be debating existentially if your product will/has product market fit. Later on, you'll tend to be waiting on work to get done to progress "customers are asking for X, we're trying to ship X, and it's more complex as we're much larger (although we try very hard to get faster as we get bigger not slower, there's just a backlog of actionable great feedback to implement)".

VC firms look like they've experience in , but many are not operational experts - and the advice comes across as vague and high level as a result. That's ok - the first reason they exist is to finance... being particularly good at running businesses is an added plus.


- Community.
  - UK founders
  - Open source founders
- Office hours.
- Investment.
- Recruitment.
- Angel investing opportunities.
  - I did two of these then figured it was a distraction. If you were into it, I think this could be really appealing.

##Â What could be better?

- There's inherent conflict between the Growth fund and external investors. Ie they want into good companies. Not an easy solve since the growth fund is awesome and working with them has massively outweighed this.
- We help dozens (probably 30+) of other companies. They'll implement the same learnings as us. This makes it harder to stand out. However, it's good karma / network-building and we benefited from those before us.

## Conclusion

There's a lot of ongoing support. A lot of this is provided through network effects so it scales surprisingly well.

Most importantly, it has changed how we see ourselves. Hanging out with lots of other companies

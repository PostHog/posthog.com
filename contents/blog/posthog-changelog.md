## February 24, 2023

### Performance monitoring in session recordings
**Paid feature**

Thanks to Team Session Recording, you can now track network performance across a user session. Now you'll be able to see not only what your users are doing, but also how long each action takes, and if there were any issues that may have impacted their experience. 

Armed with this information, you can now get a better understanding of where you can improve the user experience and create a faster, smoother product — check [the Session Recording docs](/manual/recordings) to find out more. 

### User interview app released

Curious how we gather user feedback at PostHog? We've automated it using the [User Interviewer app](/apps/user-interviews). The app enables us to target users based on their actions, cohort or properties, who we then invite to schedule an interview with our Product team via Calendly.

We find this works a lot better than trying to identify and schedule calls individually – we increased booking conversion from 3% to 16% using this app – so we’ve now made it available in [the PostHog app directory](/apps).

### JSON feature flags released

We’ve rolled JSON feature flags out to make feature flags on PostHog even more flexible and reactive than ever before. You’re now no longer limited to using strings as flag keys, and can also send arbitrary data as a JSON payload. 

The ability to send arbitrary data is especially powerful, as you can use this to trigger UI changes for users — enabling you to make real-time changes to your product without the need to redeploy. Check [the feature flag docs](/manual/feature-flags) for more information!

### UX and insight updates
![flag overrides](../images/blog/array/bubble_pie_chart.gif)

We’ve released a small trilogy of minor UX and UI improvements this week...

- We now [show pie chart values against segments](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14216)
- We now [automatically resize insight legends to be more readable](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14210)
- We now prevent you from [hiding table rows in a dashboard view](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14209)

Each of these UI updates came in response to a user suggestion. If you’ve got ideas for how we can make PostHog better, [please file a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/new/choose)!

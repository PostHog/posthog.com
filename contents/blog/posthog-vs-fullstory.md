PostHog and FullStory are both powerful tools for understanding user behavior and improving your digital product, but there are several important differences between them. Want to cut to the chase? Here’s the short answer.

- **PostHog** is an all-in-one product improvement platform built primarily for engineers and technical users. It offers a wide range of features to help teams build better products, including analytics, feature flags, session replays, and more. It’s also entirely open-source. 

- **FullStory** is primarily a session replay tool focused on helping product managers and UX specialists to understand more about how their users interact with product UI. 

In this comparison, we'll explore, compare and contrast PostHog and FullStory in detail, so you can decide which tool is right for you. We’ll look at areas such as…

Core features and what types of users PostHog and FullStory are built for
Product analytics capabilities and how these features connect to others
Session replays, performance monitoring and privacy protection
Integrations with other software, and PostHog’s app platform
Privacy, security and compliance 
Pricing details and other frequently asked questions 

### How is PostHog different from FullStory?
Before delving into the weeds, it’s worth understanding how PostHog is built for a different audience than FullStory and why it has a broader feature set. 

#### PostHog is an all-in-one product improvement platform
While FullStory includes a few additional features, it is mostly focused on being a session replay tool, while PostHog has a much wider scope. That’s because PostHog is intended to be an all-in-one platform and can easily replace an entire stack of traditionally disparate tools, such as LaunchDarkly, Amplitude, and FullStory.  

#### PostHog is for engineers, technical users, _builders_
PostHog has been designed from the ground up to meet the needs of developers and product-focused engineers. This is reflected not only in the scope of the features, but also the documentation and platform architecture. For example, PostHog offers advanced tools for debugging user issues within session replays. 

#### PostHog is open source
As an open source platform, PostHog is almost entirely transparent. You can check out the PostHog repo to monitor code changes, build your own features and apps, and even interact with the team directly. FullStory, on the other hand, is entirely closed source.

### Comparing PostHog and FullStory
Both PostHog and FullStory offer three main pricing tiers, but how these tiers differ is actually quite different. 

**PostHog** has a simple free tier with a limited feature set and a generous allowance of 1 million free events and 15,000 free sessions each month, after which users move to a more full featured paid plan which is billed based on usage. The third tier is an enterprise add-on, which expands the feature set further with the permissioning and privacy tools needed by large organizations.

>  Check [PostHog’s pricing page](/pricing) to find out more about what’s included in each tier, or to see how per-event pricing scales.

**FullStory**, on the other hand, offers only three premium, paid-for tiers, which differ in available features. The basic Business plan offers minimal features and a limited 14-day trial, while the following Advanced and Enterprise plans increase the feature scope and, presumably, cost. 

We say ‘presumably’ because FullStory’s pricing isn’t transparent and there’s no way to know exactly how much each tier costs. At PostHog, that’s [an approach we strongly disagree with](/blog/transparent-enterprise-pricing). 

In order to offer a straightforward comparison of PostHog and FullStory, we’ll focus this article on the _enterprise_ versions of both products — that is, the most feature-complete tiers. In this way we can clearly establish the features which both products do or do not have without getting bogged down in what features are available on each tier. However, if a particular feature is critically important to you, we strongly advise checking the details of FullStory’s pricing, as it isn’t as straightforward as PostHog’s.

- **Product analytics:** Both FullStory and PostHog offer product analytic features, but while both can tick this box broadly there’s a drastic difference in the implementation for these features. We’ll therefore explore this comparison in greater detail below. 

- **Apps/Integrations:** While both FullStory and PostHog offer standard integrations between themselves and other platforms — for example, for sending data to Salesforce — PostHog also gets a step further. On PostHog, users can additionally build their own apps on top of the platform, including site apps which can be used to inject surveys, messages and prompts into a product. We’ll explore this in more detail below, or you can [check the PostHog app library](/apps) for more info. 

### Product Analytics

PostHog and FullStory are ultimately positioned for different types of users, and this is reflected in the scope of their analytics offering. While FullStory is aimed most squarely at UI designers and general product managers, PostHog is suited to product engineers, front-end developers and more technical users. As a result, PostHog offers a wider range of analytics tools, including [its own SQL dialect for detailed analysis](/docs/product-analytics/hogql).

[Restack](https://posthog.com/marketplace/restack) is a platform for deployiong open-source software stacks on Kubernetes and is run by a team of open-source enthusiasts. It's a natural match for [the PostHog Marketplace](https://posthog.com/marketplace/), where we've steadily grown the number of businesses offering services and support over the last few months. 

Restack enables you to deploy and benefit from a self-hosted PostHog instance, but without the maintenance busy work. Best of all, Restack Console can ensure that deployments are [HIPAA](/docs/privacy/hipaa-compliance), FISMA and SOC2 compliant — handy if you deal with a lot of [PII](/blog/what-is-personal-data-pii). Find out more in [the Marketplace, or head to [Restack's store listing for PostHog](https://www.restack.io/store/posthog) to find more great videos like the one above!

### Other improvements & fixes
Version 1.36.0 also adds hundreds of other fixes and improvements, including...

### Deprecation and removal notices
- The previous update, [PostHog 1.35.0](blog/the-posthog-array-1-35-0), changed SAML from being instance-based to domain-based. This means that SAML configurations takes place in the PostHog UI. You can have multiple SAML providers on the same instance (segment by domain, from the user's email address). Please review our [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.
- If you use SAML on a self-hosted instance and have enabled SAML enforcement (previously `SAML_ENFORCED` environment variable) then this environment configuration has been deprecated too. You will now need to configure SSO enforcement via Authentication domains. Check the [SSO docs](/sso) for more details.

Black Friday is normally an occasion to shop around for a new TV or mobile phone. But we wanted to do something a little different; something to celebrate and support the open source community which we both rely upon and are proud to be part of. 

So, we’re announcing our Give Back Friday campaign. **For every GitHub star we receive on [the PostHog repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) between now and Cyber Monday we’ll donate $5 USD across eight handpicked open-source projects.** 

## Who gets the money? 

We’re donating to the following projects, all of which are either used extensively in our website or product, or have been suggested for their daily usefulness to our team outside of work. 

| **Project**                                                                | **What is it?**                                                         | **Why we're supporting it**                                                                     |

## How does this work?

That’s easy. Between now and 00:01 BST, 30 November simply follow these steps:

1. Login to GitHub and go to [the PostHog repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog).
2. Click the :star: icon. Hint: it's in the top right corner.
3. That’s it. We'll donate on your behalf!

On the morning of Tuesday, 30 November we’ll count up how many stars we’ve gained and contact the projects above to make the donation. You can unstar later if you’d like, but we suggest waiting until later in the week. That way, you’ll be sure your star counted! 

## Why are we doing this?

We wanted to create a festive activity but, because most of our paying users are other businesses, we didn’t want to simply slash prices. Instead, we wanted to truly celebrate and support the open-source community in a meaningful way.

We also wanted to involve our community too, which is why we’ve chosen to give donations based on GitHub stars. If you’d like to unstar us after we’ve counted your contributions, that’s absolutely fine. 

## Is there any small print?

Yes, some.

Firstly, there were two projects we chose _not_ to support and which we feel it is important to be transparent about:

- **[ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse):** We use ClickHouse _a lot_. But we think [they’re OK for money](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/clickhouse-raises-250m-series-b-140000178.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE-ii8UrZj10_InIQuIXQaVVpXMUZFq_hGhLr5Nh-plFNGhlJU8KfFuvv0vwF-dJAwYLMNg01nmNWJS5YycYfL9tKRx7JvWpx31j7TSosATyCMKLnzoib5yh-T7zGn2lxVHmFTkWZ1tyiwcxVEVnbZBKTXX5DCzI0x0h57EkiSnp) right now. 
- **[Kea](https://github.com/keajs/kea):** We use Kea a lot too, but it is run by one of our existing team members, Marius. He’s fine with this, by the way. 

Some other matters of small print:

1. There’s a maximum donation of $50,000 in total. 
2. The total sum of donations shall be divided equally between projects. 
3. Donations are at the discretion of PostHog and all decisions are final. 
4. Donations are in addition to [our usual, on-going open-source sponsorship](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/marketing/open-source-sponsorship).

That's it. 

> Support the projects that make PostHog possible by [heading to the PostHog repo and starring it today!](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) We'll donate $5 for every star between now and the end of Cyber Monday!

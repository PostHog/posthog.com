Want to understand the difference between [Pendo](/best-pendo-alternatives) and PostHog? Here's the short answer:

1. **Pendo** is a product experience platform with in-app guides, product analytics, session replay, feedback collection, and roadmap tools.

2. **PostHog** is an all-in-one developer platform that includes [product analytics](/product-analytics), [web analytics](/web-analytics), [workflows](/workflows), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [session replays](/session-replay), [error tracking](/error-tracking), [logs](/logs), a [data warehouse](/data-stack), and more.

Now it's time for the long answer...

In this article we'll explore the crucial differences and similarities between Pendo (specifically, Pendo Engage) and PostHog. We’ll cover topics such as:

-   Pendo and PostHog's [core features](#comparing-posthog-and-pendo)
-   [Product analytics](#product-analytics) and [messaging & feedback](#in-app-engagement-messaging-and-feedback) features in detail
-   [Data pipelines](#cdp-and-integrations) and [popular integrations](#popular-integrations)
-   [Libraries](#library-support), [tracking differences and SDKs](#sdks-and-tracking)
-   [Privacy, security and regulatory compliance](#compliance-and-security)
-   Other [frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. PostHog is an all-in one platform

PostHog brings all the tools engineers need to measure success, run experiments, and more, into one platform. It’s a complete, all-in-one product OS, with robust [analytics](/docs/product-analytics), [feature flagging](/docs/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/docs/experiments), [session capturing](/docs/session-replay), [error tracking](/docs/error-tracking) features, and more. Pendo now includes session replay on higher tiers, but still requires separate tools for feature flags, A/B testing, error tracking, and more.

### 2. PostHog is built for engineers

We built PostHog to support technically-savvy product managers and engineers — especially [engineers with a product focus in their role](/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer). As such, PostHog includes many powerful features that aren't available in tools like Pendo, which are built for more general audiences. It also means you get support from the engineers who _actually build the product_, [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), and a [SQL query builder](/docs/product-analytics/sql), so you can analyze data how you want.

### 3. Transparent pricing, generous free tiers

Our [pricing](/pricing) is 100% transparent. There are no hidden fees or surprise overages – what you see is exactly what you'll pay.

We also default to charging as little as possible while still making a sensible margin, and every product comes with a generous free tier. In fact, more than 90% of companies use PostHog for free!

> In 2024, we [cut prices for session replay](/blog/session-replay-pricing) and [analytics events](/blog/analytics-pricing). In 2025, we've [cut prices for data pipelines](/blog/data-pipeline-pricing) and surveys. If we can cut pass a saving onto our customers, we always will.

## Comparing PostHog and Pendo

**Pendo** has four pricing tiers — Free, Base, Core, and Ultimate – for its main product, Pendo Engage. Pendo's Free plan is limited to 500 monthly active users and doesn't include session replays.

**PostHog** uses usage-based pricing with a generous free tier – no credit card required, and unlimited teammates on every plan. Every month, you get 1 million events, 5,000 session replays, 1 million feature flag requests, and more for free. After that, you only pay for what you use, and pricing gets cheaper at scale.

Adding a credit card unlocks additional features like advanced paths, correlation analysis, lifecycle insights, and dashboard subscriptions. [Startups can qualify for $50k in free credits](/startups), and you can set billing limits per product to avoid surprises. See the [pricing page](/pricing) for a full breakdown.

- **Product Analytics and Web Analytics**: 1 million events/month
- **Session Replay**: 5,000 recordings/month
- **Feature Flags**: 1 million requests/month
- **Surveys**: 1,500 responses/month
- **Data warehouse**: 1 million synced rows/month + free historical syncs for the first 7 days for each new source
- **Error tracking**: 100 thousand exceptions/month
- **LLM analytics**: 100 thousand events/month
- **Logs**: 50GB ingested/month
- **Workflows**: 10,000 messages per channel/month
- **PostHog AI**: 2,000 credits/month

</p>

-   **Session replays:** [Session replays](/session-replay) in PostHog recreate exactly what real users see and how they use your product. They also enable you to debug problems using built-in console logs and network performance.

-   **Feature flags:** PostHog includes [multivariate feature flags](/feature-flags) that support JSON payloads, enabling you to push real-time changes to your product without redeploying. Teams can use feature flags to offer different features or UI choices to users, to trigger in-app messages, and more.

-   **A/B testing:** In PostHog, you can use the [experimentation suite](/experiments) to create multivariate tests within your product, such as showing some users a different page layout to others. Over time, you can build an understanding of which page performs better, correlate results with other events, and deploy a final version.

### Product Analytics

PostHog and Pendo are ultimately built for different types of users. While PostHog is designed with engineers and technical users in mind, Pendo is intended more for marketers and UX designers.

This difference is reflected in all levels of the product, but especially in product analytics, where many advanced features which are lacking in Pendo, are available in PostHog.

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'pendo']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'dashboards',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'product_analytics.features.cohorts',
        'product_analytics.user_paths',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        'web_analytics.features.utm_tracking',

        'product_analytics.insights.features.formula_mode',
        'product_analytics.insights.features.sql_editor',
    ]}
/>
</p>

-   **Correlation analysis:** [Correlation analysis](/product-analytics) automatically highlights significant linking properties or events relevant to an insight. For example, you can find if users who complete a funnel are likely to be from a certain location, or have completed another event. In PostHog, correlation analysis is a standard part of analytics.

-   **Formulas:** Formulas in PostHog enable you to create custom insights using your data. A simple example of a formula would be an equation to figure out a ratio or percentage (e.g. the percentage of users who completed two different events), though advanced formulas can use more elaborate functions, such as `COS` and `SIN`.

-   **SQL access:** While both PostHog and Pendo have ready-made insights and visualization types, only PostHog gives you unlimited access to your data by [writing your own SQL queries](/docs/sql). This is ideal for data scientists, product managers, and engineers who want to perform advanced analysis on user data.

### In-app engagement, messaging, and feedback

Pendo is built around in-app guides, tooltips, onboarding flows, and collecting user feedback. PostHog covers this ground with two dedicated products: [Surveys](/surveys) and [Workflows](/workflows).

[**Surveys**](/docs/surveys) let you collect qualitative feedback directly inside your product – NPS, CSAT, CES, ratings, multiple choice, open text, and link prompts with custom CTAs. Surveys can be displayed as popovers, feedback buttons, or via the API for fully custom UIs. You can target surveys based on person properties, URLs, feature flags, or specific events, and because surveys are part of PostHog, you can see who responded, watch their session replays, and analyze responses alongside your product analytics.

[**Workflows**](/docs/workflows) is PostHog's no-code automation builder for sending behavior-triggered messages and actions. You can send emails, Slack messages, and SMS (via Twilio), add delays and branching logic, split audiences, and trigger any CDP destination – all based on live product events. Think onboarding drip campaigns, milestone notifications, or Slack alerts when a user hits a key event.

The main difference from Pendo is approach: Pendo offers a simpler drag-and-drop editor for tooltips and product tours aimed at non-technical PMs. PostHog gives you more flexibility and deeper integration with your product data, but doesn't have Pendo's visual tooltip builder.

### CDP and integrations

Pendo integrates with popular tools like Salesforce, Jira, Slack, and Segment, and supports data export via webhooks and APIs. But it doesn't offer native data pipeline or CDP functionality – you'd need a separate tool like Segment or RudderStack to route data between platforms.

PostHog includes a built-in [CDP](/cdp) (Customer Data Platform) with three core components: **sources** for ingesting data from 20+ managed integrations (Stripe, Hubspot, Salesforce, Snowflake, BigQuery, Google/Meta/LinkedIn Ads, and more), **transformations** for cleaning and enriching event data in real-time (GeoIP enrichment, PII scrubbing, bot filtering, property standardization), and **destinations** for sending PostHog data to other tools in real-time or via batch export.

Because the CDP is built into PostHog, imported data lives alongside your product analytics, session replays, and feature flags – so you can join data with product behavior in a single query without stitching systems together. PostHog also integrates with third-party CDPs like [Segment](/docs/libraries/segment) and [RudderStack](/docs/libraries/rudderstack) if you already have one set up.

## Compliance and security

Regulatory compliance can be a critical need for many teams, especially if they operate in financial or healthcare industries. Regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR can require teams to store data in certain locations, or to protect data in certain ways.

<p>

## SDKs and tracking

Pendo and PostHog both support a variety of tracking and implementation options to get your data into their platform. Both platforms enable you to create tracked events manually, as well as offering autocapture to help you get started quickly.

Autocapture is preferred by many users because it's faster to set up, but some argue that it creates too much noise or cost to be useful. We disagree, and it's why PostHog gives you your first million events for free, every month — so you can capture events without worrying about these issues. [It's something we feel quite strongly about](/blog/is-autocapture-still-bad).

## When to choose PostHog vs Pendo

- Want analytics that connect directly to feature flags, experiments, error tracking, and session replays – with transparent pricing and no sales calls? Go with **PostHog**.

- Need a platform focused on in-app guides, tooltips, onboarding flows, and product validation – with a visual editor built for non-technical PMs? **Pendo** is built for that.

## Recommendations by team type

**For engineering-led product teams**
- **PostHog** – SQL access, feature flags with local evaluation, error tracking, LLM analytics, and extensive APIs make it the natural fit for teams where engineers drive product decisions. Open source with a public roadmap means you can see exactly what's coming.

**For non-technical product managers**
- **Pendo** – Designed for PMs who want to create in-app guides, tooltips, and onboarding flows without writing code. Its visual editor and product validation tools are purpose-built for teams that don't have engineering resources for every in-app change.

**For teams building and shipping features frequently**
- **PostHog** – Feature flags, A/B testing, and error tracking let you roll out safely, measure impact, and catch regressions – all in one platform. Pendo doesn't offer feature flags, experiments, or error tracking natively.

**For teams focused on user onboarding and adoption**
- **Pendo** – In-app guides, tooltips, walkthroughs, resource centers, and NPS surveys are Pendo's core strength. PostHog covers [surveys](/surveys) and automated messaging via [Workflows](/workflows), but doesn't have Pendo's visual tooltip builder.

**For teams building AI products**
- **PostHog** – [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics) tracks model performance, token costs, latency, and traces. Pendo has no equivalent.

**For privacy-conscious and regulated organizations**
- Both are SOC 2 certified, GDPR-ready, and HIPAA-ready, with EU data residency options. **PostHog** adds open source code, cookieless tracking, and a built-in [data warehouse](/docs/data-warehouse) for full data ownership. Pendo offers EU hosting (GCP EU multi-region) but doesn't offer self-hosting.

**For early-stage startups**
- **PostHog** – Generous free tiers across every product (1M events, 5k replays, 1M flag requests/mo), transparent pricing you can model in advance, and [startups can qualify for $50k in free credits](/startups). Pendo's free tier is limited to 500 MAUs with Pendo branding; paid plans require sales conversations.

**For enterprise product teams**
- **Both work**, but for different reasons. Pendo excels at in-app engagement, onboarding, and product validation for large PM teams. PostHog excels at analytics depth, experimentation, error tracking, and developer tooling. Choose based on whether your priority is guiding users (Pendo) or understanding and shipping to them (PostHog).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is PostHog useful for?</summary>

**PostHog** is built primarily for engineers, technical product managers, and product-focused engineering teams. Beyond product analytics, PostHog includes [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/experiments), [session replays](/session-replay) with console logs and network monitoring, [error tracking](/error-tracking), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), [surveys](/surveys), [logs](/logs), [workflows](/workflows) for automated messaging, and a built-in [data warehouse](/data-warehouse) — all with SQL access and extensive APIs.

PostHog is a good fit if your team wants a single platform that covers the full build-measure-learn cycle: ship with feature flags, track with analytics, debug with replays and error tracking, iterate with experiments...

</details>

<details>
<summary>How much does Pendo cost?</summary>

Pendo uses MAU-based (monthly active users) pricing across four tiers — Free, Base, Core, and Ultimate — but doesn't publish prices publicly. You need to contact their sales team for a quote.

The **Free** tier supports up to 500 MAUs with basic analytics, in-app guides, and branded NPS surveys. **Base** adds one integration and expanded analytics. **Core** adds session replay. **Ultimate** adds NPS (unbranded), product discovery, journey orchestration, and data synchronization. Some features like Pendo Listen (feedback) and additional integrations are available as paid add-ons on lower tiers.

Based on third-party data from Vendr and customer reports, typical Pendo costs range from around $15,000 to $140,000+ per year depending on MAU count, features, and contract terms. Paid plans are annual only — Pendo doesn't offer monthly billing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How much does PostHog cost?</summary>

PostHog uses transparent, usage-based [pricing](/pricing). It's free to get started — no credit card required — and every month you get generous free allowances including 1 million analytics events, 5,000 session replays, and 1 million feature flag requests.

After the free tier, you pay only for what you use, and pricing gets cheaper at scale. You can set billing limits per product to avoid surprises, and all pricing is public on the [pricing page](/pricing). Volume discounts and [startup credits of $50k](/startups) are available. In practice, more than 90% of PostHog users stay on the free tier.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do Pendo and PostHog offer free trials?</summary>

**Pendo** offers a free tier (Pendo Free) rather than a time-limited trial. It supports up to 500 MAUs with basic analytics, in-app guides, and branded NPS surveys. Once you exceed 500 MAUs, you can no longer create guides or segments, and usage data is sampled. Pendo does not offer free trials of its paid plans — you need to contact sales.

**PostHog** is free to start with no restrictions on features or time. All users get 1 million events, 5,000 session replays, and 1 million feature flag requests free every month. You can set billing limits to keep usage within the free allowance indefinitely, and there's no Pendo-style branding on free accounts. Adding a credit card unlocks advanced features like correlation analysis and lifecycle insights while still staying on the free tier.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Pendo have feature flags or A/B testing?</summary>

No. Pendo doesn't offer native feature flags, A/B testing, or experimentation. If you need to roll out features gradually, run experiments, or toggle functionality by user segment, you'd need a separate tool like LaunchDarkly or Optimizely.

**PostHog** includes both [feature flags](/feature-flags) and [A/B testing](/experiments) natively, tightly integrated with analytics and session replay. You can target flags by user properties, roll out gradually, measure experiment impact on funnels and retention, and debug issues by filtering replays to specific flag variants.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Pendo have error tracking?</summary>

No. Pendo doesn't offer error tracking, crash monitoring, or exception handling. You'd need a separate tool like Sentry or Bugsnag for this.

**PostHog** includes native [error tracking](/error-tracking) that connects exceptions and stack traces directly to session replays, user behavior, and feature flag changes — so you can see exactly what a user was doing when an error occurred and whether a specific release caused it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Pendo have LLM analytics?</summary>

No. Pendo doesn't offer AI or LLM observability features.

**PostHog** includes [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics) for tracking AI product usage, monitoring model performance, analyzing token costs and latency, and debugging LLM interactions with traces — useful for any team building AI-powered features.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which has better session replay — PostHog or Pendo?</summary>

Both offer session replay, but with different strengths. **Pendo** includes session replay on Core plans and above, focused on understanding user journeys through your product alongside in-app guide performance.

**PostHog** includes more developer-focused replay features: console logs, network request monitoring, DOM explorer, performance metrics, and direct links between replays and error tracking or feature flag evaluations. PostHog's free tier includes 5,000 replays/month; Pendo's free tier does not include replay — it requires at least the Core plan.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I migrate from Pendo to PostHog?</summary>

Yes. See the [Pendo to PostHog migration guide](/docs/migrate/pendo) for step-by-step instructions on exporting your Pendo data and importing it into PostHog, including historical events and user properties.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does PostHog offer EU hosting?</summary>

Yes. PostHog offers EU-hosted cloud with data stored exclusively in the EU. PostHog is SOC 2 certified, GDPR-ready, and HIPAA-ready, with cookieless tracking options and an open-source codebase you can audit.

Pendo also offers EU data residency via GCP's EU multi-region (including Frankfurt, Warsaw, and other locations). Both platforms support GDPR and HIPAA compliance requirements.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can PostHog replace Pendo?</summary>

**For analytics, yes.** PostHog offers deeper product analytics than Pendo, including funnels, retention, user paths, cohorts, correlation analysis, formula mode, and SQL access. PostHog also includes session replay, surveys (NPS, CSAT, CES, and custom), and [Workflows](/workflows) for automated behavior-triggered messaging.

**For in-app guides, partially.** PostHog's [Surveys](/surveys) can display targeted popovers and prompts, and [Workflows](/workflows) can trigger emails, Slack messages, and SMS based on user behavior. But PostHog doesn't have Pendo's visual drag-and-drop editor for tooltips, product tours, and walkthroughs. If your team relies heavily on no-code in-app guides, Pendo's editor is still a differentiator.

</details>

    metaDescription: Looking for the best error monitoring tool with session replay? Compare PostHog vs Sentry on error tracking, performance monitoring, analytics, and more to find the right fit.
---

PostHog and [Sentry](/blog/best-sentry-alternatives) are multi-product platforms trusted by developers to help make their apps better. There is some overlap in how both manage to do that (we're both "telemetry" tools), but many features differ.

1. **Sentry** is an application monitoring tool with error and performance monitoring, session replay, code coverage, and more. It's built for engineers and devops teams.

2. **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform for building successful products. On top of [error tracking](/error-tracking), it includes [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replays](/session-replay), [feature flags](/experiments), [surveys](/surveys), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), and more. It's built for engineers and product teams.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. We focus on user behavior

The core data each product cares about reveals a lot about their priorities:

-   PostHog cares about events and people.
-   Sentry cares about errors and code.

Broadly, PostHog is mostly a proactive tool that helps you make your product better. Sentry is mostly a reactive tool that helps prevent your product from getting worse.

### 2. We're free and usage-based

We pride ourselves on having a generous free tier and this shows when compared to Sentry. Our free tier offers 100 times more session replays and 20 times more errors.

Beyond our free tier, our pricing is usage-based and transparent. We also try to be as cheap as possible. Want to know how much we'll charge? See our [pricing calculator](/pricing#calculator).

Sentry also limits many of its features, including team collaboration, to its higher, paid tiers.

### 3. Flexibility and breadth

Sentry is much more focused and opinionated in how you use it. The tools are tailored for developers and devops teams to do error and performance monitoring.

PostHog offers more flexibility and breadth. It's built for developers but also used by marketing, growth, and data teams. Startups and scaleups use PostHog for tracking [retention](/docs/product-analytics/retention), running targeted [A/B tests](/experiments), [booking user interviews](/tutorials/feedback-interviews-site-apps), and more.

More examples of this flexibility include PostHog's simpler [custom event capture](/docs/getting-started/send-events#2-capture-custom-events), the ability to [import and use data from external sources](/data-warehouse), and [direct SQL querying](/docs/sql).

## Comparing PostHog and Sentry

Tracking exceptions in PostHog enables you to easily integrate with all of the other products we offer. You can easily create insights to track errors over time, watch replays of users encountering an exception, or target surveys when a user faces a bug.

Given PostHog already tracks context about your users, it is possible to understand the impact of exceptions more accurately. For example, you can filter issues affecting VIP user cohorts, debug errors by watching replays of their sessions, or find errors affecting the most amount of sessions.

### Core features

The core of PostHog and Sentry are different. Sentry focuses on error and performance monitoring, while PostHog has error tracking along with a broader suite of tools to help developers build better products.

        'heatmaps',
    ]}
/>

-   Sentry includes the ability to create and visualize custom metrics as you would do with product analytics, but its visualizations and customizability is limited compared to PostHog.

-   PostHog includes [network performance tracking](/docs/session-replay/network-recording) in session replay and [web vitals tracking](/docs/web-analytics/web-vitals) in web analytics. This helps you both analyze performance and requests for specific sessions and get an overview of web vitals and areas for improvement.

### Platform

    rows={[
        'platform.developer.api',
        'platform.deployment.open_source',
        'platform.deployment.eu_hosting',

        'platform.developer.sdks',
        { label: 'Free team members', description: 'Invite your team to your project for free', values: [true, false] },
    ]}
/>

-   Sentry's free plan is limited to 1 user, 5k errors, and 50 replays, along with several feature restrictions. PostHog has a [free plan](/pricing) and a "pay-as-you-go" paid plan with a generous free tier, meaning you get to use all of the features for free.

### Error and performance monitoring

Error and performance monitoring is the main focus of Sentry. Although PostHog has a full error tracking app, it's missing some of the tracing and monitoring features that Sentry offers.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'error_tracking.features.exception_capture',
        'error_tracking.pricing.free_tier',

        'error_tracking.monitoring.cron_monitoring',
        'error_tracking.monitoring.release_tracking',
    ]}
/>

### Session replay

Replays enable you to watch how users experience your app, diagnose issues, improve support, and understand real user behavior. Both PostHog and Sentry have this as a core part of their offering.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'session_replay.platform_support.web_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.platform_support.ios_recordings',

        'session_replay.targeting.target_by_sample',
        'session_replay.privacy.privacy_masking',
        'session_replay.analysis.console_logs',
        'session_replay.features.canvas_recording',
        { label: 'Free allowance', description: 'Free recordings per month', values: ['5,000', '50'] },
        { label: '50k replays cost', description: 'Cost per month of 50,000 replays', values: ['$173', '$172'] },
        { label: '100k replays cost', description: 'Cost per month of 100,000 replays', values: ['$273', '$314'] },
    ]}
/>

### Feedback and surveys

Feedback in Sentry is connected to errors and included as part of the price. It is built to capture feedback, bug reports, and crash reports.

[Surveys](/surveys) in PostHog are a standalone product with more customization and targeting options.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'surveys.question_types.freeform_text',
        'surveys.question_types.rating',
        'surveys.question_types.multiple_choice',
        'surveys.branching.multi_step_surveys',
        'surveys.templates.survey_templates',
        'surveys.targeting.event_triggered',
        'surveys.targeting.custom_targeting',
        'surveys.presentation.custom_ui',
        'surveys.implementation.api_access',
        { label: 'Free allowance', description: 'Free responses per month', values: ['1,500', 'Included'] },
    ]}
/>

### Analytics

On the flip side to error and performance monitoring, analytics is a main focus of PostHog where it shines compared to Sentry.

Sentry does have some analytics capabilities but it is limited compared to PostHog's full suite of product analytics features. On top of this, many of Sentry's features like custom dashboards and insights are exclusive to their more expensive business plan.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.features.custom_events',
        'product_analytics.features.autocapture',
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'product_analytics.insights.features.sql_editor',
        'dashboards',
        'web_analytics',
    ]}
/>

-   An error in Sentry and an event in PostHog are relatively similar. Using this as a basis, PostHog has a 200x higher free tier (5k vs 1M).

-   Sentry only autocaptures errors. If you really wanted to use it to capture clicks and pageviews, you would need to do so manually.

### Security and compliance

### Integrations

Both PostHog and Sentry work with other tools, but PostHog can act more as a single source of truth for your product and user data. Sentry acts more as one of many producing data in your stack.

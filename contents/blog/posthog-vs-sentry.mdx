    metaDescription: Looking for the best error monitoring tool with session replay? Compare PostHog vs Sentry on error tracking, performance monitoring, analytics, and more to find the right fit.
---

PostHog and [Sentry](/blog/best-sentry-alternatives) are multi-product platforms trusted by developers to help make their apps better. There is some overlap in how both manage to do that (we're both "telemetry" tools), but many features differ.

1. **Sentry** is an application monitoring tool with error and performance monitoring, session replay, code coverage, and more. It's built for engineers and devops teams.

2. **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform for building successful products. On top of [error tracking](/error-tracking), it includes [product analytics](/product-analytics), [experiments](/experiments), [session replays](/session-replay), [feature flags](/experiments), [surveys](/surveys), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), an [AI assistant](/ai), and more. It's built for engineers and product teams.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. We focus on user behavior

The core data each product cares about reveals a lot about their priorities:

-   PostHog cares about events and people.
-   Sentry cares about errors and code.

Broadly, PostHog is mostly a proactive tool that helps you make your product better. Sentry is mostly a reactive tool that helps prevent your product from getting worse.

### 2. We're free and usage-based

We pride ourselves on having a generous free tier and this shows when compared to Sentry. Our free tier offers 100 times more session replays and 20 times more errors.

Beyond our free tier, our pricing is usage-based and transparent. We also try to be as cheap as possible. Want to know how much we'll charge? See our [pricing calculator](/pricing#calculator).

Sentry also limits many of its features (e.g. UI profiling) to its higher, paid tiers.

### 3. Flexibility and breadth

Sentry is much more focused and opinionated in how you use it. The tools are tailored for developers and devops teams to do error and performance monitoring.

PostHog offers more flexibility and breadth. It's built for developers but also used by marketing, growth, and data teams. Startups and scaleups use PostHog for tracking [retention](/docs/product-analytics/retention), running targeted [A/B tests](/experiments), [booking user interviews](/tutorials/feedback-interviews-site-apps), and more.

More examples of this flexibility include PostHog's simpler [custom event capture](/docs/getting-started/send-events#2-capture-custom-events), the ability to [import and use data from external sources](/data-warehouse), and [direct SQL querying](/docs/sql).

## Comparing PostHog and Sentry

Tracking exceptions in PostHog enables you to easily integrate with all of the other products we offer. You can easily create insights to track errors over time, watch replays of users encountering an exception, or target surveys when a user faces a bug.

Given PostHog already tracks context about your users, it is possible to understand the impact of exceptions more accurately. For example, you can filter issues affecting VIP user cohorts, debug errors by watching replays of their sessions, or find errors affecting the most amount of sessions.

### Core features

The core of PostHog and Sentry are different. Sentry focuses on error and performance monitoring, while PostHog has error tracking along with a broader suite of tools to help developers build better products.

    ]}
/>

-  Sentry offers Discover, Dashboards, and Performance Trends for querying and visualizing application data, but it doesn't include product-analytics features like funnels, retention, or user paths found in PostHog.

-   PostHog includes [network performance tracking](/docs/session-replay/network-recording) in session replay and [web vitals tracking](/docs/web-analytics/web-vitals) in web analytics. This helps you both analyze performance and requests for specific sessions and get an overview of web vitals and areas for improvement.

### Platform

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'platform.developer.api',
        'platform.deployment.open_source',
        'platform.deployment.eu_hosting',

        'platform.developer.sdks',
        { label: 'Free team members', description: 'Invite your team to your project for free', values: [true, false] },
    ]}
/>

-   Sentry's free plan is limited to 1 user, 5k errors, and 50 replays, along with several feature restrictions. PostHog has a [free plan](/pricing) and a "pay-as-you-go" paid plan with a generous free tier, meaning you get to use all of the features for free.

### Error and performance monitoring

Error and performance monitoring is the main focus of Sentry. Although PostHog has a full error tracking app, it's missing some of the tracing and monitoring features that Sentry offers.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'error_tracking.features.exception_capture',
        'error_tracking.pricing.free_tier',

        'error_tracking.monitoring.cron_monitoring',
        'error_tracking.monitoring.release_tracking',
    ]}
/>

### Session replay

Replays enable you to watch how users experience your app, diagnose issues, improve support, and understand real user behavior. Both PostHog and Sentry have this as a core part of their offering.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'session_replay.platform_support.web_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.platform_support.ios_recordings',

        { label: 'Free allowance', description: 'Free recordings per month', values: ['5,000', '50'] },
        { label: '50k replays cost', description: 'Cost per month of 50,000 replays', values: ['$173', '$172'] },
        { label: '100k replays cost', description: 'Cost per month of 100,000 replays', values: ['$273', '$314'] },
    ]}
/>

### Feedback and surveys

Feedback in Sentry is connected to errors and included as part of the price. It is built to capture feedback, bug reports, and crash reports.

[Surveys](/surveys) in PostHog are a standalone product with more customization and targeting options.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'surveys.question_types.freeform_text',
        'surveys.question_types.rating',
        'surveys.question_types.multiple_choice',
        'surveys.branching.multi_step_surveys',
        'surveys.templates.survey_templates',
        'surveys.targeting.event_triggered',
        'surveys.targeting.custom_targeting',
        'surveys.presentation.custom_ui',
        'surveys.implementation.api_access',
        { label: 'Free allowance', description: 'Free responses per month', values: ['1,500', 'Included'] },
    ]}
/>

### Analytics

On the flip side to error and performance monitoring, analytics is a main focus of PostHog where it shines compared to Sentry.

Sentry does have some analytics capabilities but it is limited compared to PostHog's full suite of product analytics features. On top of this, many of Sentry's features like insights and advanced dashboard controls are exclusive to their more expensive business plan.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'sentry']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.features.custom_events',
        'product_analytics.features.autocapture',
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'product_analytics.insights.features.sql_editor',
        'dashboards',
        'web_analytics',
    ]}
/>

-   An error in Sentry and an event in PostHog are relatively similar. Using this as a basis, PostHog has a 200x higher free tier (5k vs 1M).

-   Sentry only autocaptures errors. If you really wanted to use it to capture clicks and pageviews, you would need to do so manually.

### Security and compliance

        'platform.security.two_factor_auth',
        'platform.security.saml_sso',
    ]}
/>

### Integrations

Both PostHog and Sentry work with other tools, but PostHog can act more as a single source of truth for your product and user data. Sentry acts more as one of many producing data in your stack.

For a detailed comparison of features, pricing, and use cases, see our full guide to the [best error tracking tools](/blog/best-error-tracking-tools).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are there open-source error tracking tools?</summary>

Yes. **PostHog**, **Sentry**, and **GlitchTip** all offer open-source editions. These options are ideal for teams who want full data ownership and flexibility in how they run their error tracking systems.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Which error tracking tool is better for early-stage startups?</summary>

**PostHog** is usually the better starting point. Early-stage teams benefit from a single tool that covers [a full suite of products](/products) without managing multiple integrations or contracts. **Sentry** becomes more valuable as infrastructure complexity increases.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between error tracking and logging?</summary>

**Logging** records all application events (info, warnings, errors) in chronological order for debugging and auditing. **Error tracking** specifically captures exceptions and crashes, groups them by root cause, and provides context like stack traces, affected users, and frequency. Error tracking tools are purpose-built for triaging and resolving bugs, while logs require more manual analysis.

PostHog offers both – error tracking is generally available, and [logs](/docs/logs) is currently in beta.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between error tracking and APM?</summary>

**Error tracking** focuses on catching and diagnosing bugs, crashes, and exceptions. **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** measures response times, throughput, and resource usage to identify slowdowns and bottlenecks. 

Many tools like Sentry offer both, while PostHog combines error tracking with product analytics instead of traditional APM.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can error tracking tools work with serverless and edge functions?</summary>

Yes. Modern error trackers support serverless and edge runtimes—including AWS Lambda, Vercel Edge Functions, and Cloudflare Workers. Both PostHog and Sentry provide SDKs and guides for these environments (for example, **Sentry**'s AWS Lambda and Cloudflare Workers guides; **PostHog**'s [Vercel](/docs/libraries/vercel) and [Cloudflare Workers](/docs/libraries/cloudflare-workers) docs). Configuration can differ from traditional servers because of cold starts, runtime differences (e.g., Edge runtimes), and execution/time limits imposed by the platforms.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I reduce noise from error tracking alerts?</summary>

Set up [intelligent alerting rules](/docs/error-tracking/alerts) based on error frequency, affected user count, or specific error types. Use sampling for high-volume, low-priority errors. Configure ignore rules for known issues or third-party errors you can't control. 

Both **PostHog** and **Sentry** let you customize alert thresholds and notification channels.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Does PostHog replace Sentry?</summary>

**Yes, if** you're a startup or product team that wants error tracking with rich user context. PostHog combines error tracking with session replays, product analytics, feature flags, and more, giving you everything you need to understand who's affected, watch what happened, and ship fixes faster. For most teams, this is more than enough.

**No, if** you need infrastructure-level debugging for complex distributed systems. Sentry remains stronger for deep performance tracing, low-level profiling, span-level diagnostics, and advanced APM workflows. DevOps and SRE teams managing microservices at scale may still want to use Sentry.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What languages and frameworks do PostHog and Sentry support?</summary>

Both platforms offer broad SDK support. Sentry supports 100+ platforms including JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, .NET, React, Vue, Angular, iOS (Swift/Objective-C), Android (Java/Kotlin), React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal Engine. [PostHog](/docs/libraries) supports JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Node.js, React, Next.js, Vue, iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter. For error tracking specifically, Sentry has deeper language coverage due to its longer history as a dedicated error monitoring tool.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the learning curve for each platform?</summary>

Both platforms are designed for quick setup. **Sentry** and **PostHog** offer [comprehensive documentation](docs/error-tracking), active community support, and autocapture features that start collecting data immediately after SDK installation, no manual instrumentation required for basic usage.

**PostHog** also offers an [AI install wizard](/docs/getting-started/install?tab=wizard) that gets you up and running in under 90 seconds. The broader feature set (analytics, replays, flags, experiments) means there's more to explore, but you can adopt features incrementally as your needs grow.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do billing alerts and spend management work?</summary>

Both platforms offer spending controls. **PostHog** allows you to set hard billing limits per product (when reached, data collection pauses until the next cycle). Sentry offers spend notifications and maximum spend thresholds. **Sentry** also provides "spike protection" to prevent unexpected bills from sudden error surges. PostHog's per-product billing limits give more granular control, while Sentry's spike protection is particularly useful for error-prone applications.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do error tracking tools handle PII and sensitive data?</summary>

Most tools automatically scrub common PII patterns (emails, credit cards, passwords) from error reports. Both **PostHog** and **Sentry** let you configure custom scrubbing rules and mask sensitive fields. For session replay, both default to masking text inputs and offer granular privacy controls. Self-hosting or EU data residency options provide additional compliance flexibility.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's the best error tracking tool for mobile apps?</summary>

For native mobile crash reporting with deep symbolication, **Sentry** has more mature SDKs. For understanding user behavior alongside errors, **PostHog** provides session replay and analytics context. Both support iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter. Other mobile-focused options include **Bugsnag** and **Firebase Crashlytics**.

</details>

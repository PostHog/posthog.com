## 1. PostHog

- **Founded:** 2020
- **Similar to:** Statsig, LaunchDarkly
- **Typical users:** Engineers and product teams

![PostHog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/screenshots/feature-flags.png)

### What is PostHog?

PostHog (yup, that's us!) is an open-source, all-in-one platform for feature management, A/B testing, product analytics, session replay, and user surveys. It's also building a [data warehouse for startups](/docs/data-warehouse) and a customer data platform (CDP), though both are currently in closed beta.

By combining all these tools into one platform, it eliminates the need for stitching together integrations between third-party tools, and makes it easier for engineers to work with data. PostHog is popular with engineering-led companies, like AI startup [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs) and [Y Combinator](/customers/ycombinator), which use PostHog for both feature flags and analytics.

#### Key features

- 🚩 **Feature flags:** Rollout features safely with [local evaluation](/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation) (for faster performance), JSON payloads, and instant rollbacks.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Experiment in your app with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Auto-calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or person properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Flagsmith?

Flagsmith and PostHog are similar in their feature flag offering, but differ on other features.

PostHog offers product analytics as well as a fully-integrated A/B testing tool. Since Flagsmith doesn't have analytics, to run an A/B test you need to manually implement feature flag logging with a third-party analytics tool.

Both tools are open source. However, Flagsmith offers self-hosting while PostHog recommends self-hosting for hobbyist projects only.

    <ComparisonRow column1={"No audit log"} column2={true} feature="Governance" description="Audit log, roles-based access, permissions" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It's many tools in one:** PostHog can replace Flagsmith (feature flags and A/B testing), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (analytics), and [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all product data is in one place.

2. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and build better products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

3. **It's easy to get started:** Many users love how PostHog's event autocapture means they can go from implementing its tracking code to ingesting events in just a few minutes. Enabling session replay is equally straightforward, so you can instantly start seeing how people are navigating your app or website.

> #### Bottom line
> 
> PostHog is an ideal Flagsmith alternative if you're looking for a powerful feature flags tool that can also serve your A/B testing and analytics needs. It also offers a dedicated EU-hosted cloud at no extra cost.

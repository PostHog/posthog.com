## PostHog 1.30.0 release notes

> For a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog).

**Release highlights:**
- [Fresh new look-and-feel](#fresh-new-look-and-feel)
- [Correlation analysis](#correlation-analysis)
- [Saved insights](#saved-insights)
- [Fully revamped recordings](#fully-revamped-recordings)

### Fresh new look-and-feel

PostHog just got a lot fresher! We have a brand new UI and layout that had been on the works, codename `lemonade` (because it's fresh). It's not only a coat of paint, we've pushed a lot of improvements to overall navigation and performance, we call it turbo mode.

### Correlation analysis

Trying to understand why your users are converting or dropping? Presenting Correlation analysis. This nifty new insight will automatically match your funnels to any relevant signals on why your users convert or drop (e.g. "Users in Canada are 5x more likely to convert" or "Users in Chrome are 3x less likely to convert"). Funnel optimization to the next level. [Read more here](/docs/....).

> üéÅ Correlation analysis is a premium feature and requires a PostHog Scale or Enterprise license. [Learn more](/pricing).

<br />

### Saved insights

No more recreating the same insight multiple times. You will now be able to save insights on PostHog without adding them to a dashboard. Further, you'll be able to see a list of insights created by other team members, and easily search them and filter them. We're investing a lot of effort to make sure you can better collaborate within PostHog.

### Fully revamped recordings

The recordings playback experience just got a lot better. From significant performance improvements (you'll no longer need to wait for the entire recording to load), to a brand new playback interface. Find the right spot in a recording quickly and understand better what your users are doing.

### Other improvements & fixes
- **Turbo mode**. You'll notice a significant speed improvement when using PostHog. App navigation will now happen almost instantly. In particular, you'll notice navigation between dashboards and insights happens without any delay.
- **Duplicate dashboards**. Thanks to a community member you can now easily duplicate your dashboard instead of manually recreating it.
- **Security on Docker builds.** We've moved to a different base image for Docker (`alpine`) and this new image build solves a lot of security vulnerabilities on upstream dependencies.
- Have a large number of dashboards? You'll now be able to **easily search the dashboard list.**
- Fixed a bug that caused the app to believe there was a new version available when it wasn't ready to be shipped.
- Fixed bugs with person counts not matching between an insight graph and the person list.
- Significantly faster frontend builds as we transitioned from `webpack` to `esbuild`.
- Fixed a bug that prevented creating cohorts from trends.
- Success and error toast alerts will now show at the bottom of the screen so it no longer covers critical elements in the page.
- Plus **350+ more** improvements & fixes.

### Deprecation & removal notices

1. We're now fully removing the legacy Sessions list page. Read more about it, [in this blog post](/blog/sessions-removal).

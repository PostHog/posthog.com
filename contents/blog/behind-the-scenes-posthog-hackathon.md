As a 100% remote company, our annual company hackathon is one of our most important rituals.  

Some of our most important products and features, like session replay and our data warehouse, started as hackathon projects.

We wanted to share this with you, so at our 2025 offsite in Tulum, Mexico we shot this hackathon documentary about one of our... defining features: Hedgehog Mode. 

In [episode 1 of Ben Dreams of Hedgehogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUZRA0Y7xI), Ben White teams up with Lottie Coxon to convince people to realize Ben's dream of building a hedgehog-themed videogame.  

Is this our next multi-million dollar product? No.  

Was it a lot of fun? Absolutely. 

You can watch the first episode below, or on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUZRA0Y7xI).

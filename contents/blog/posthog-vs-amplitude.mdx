Choosing the right analytics platform often comes down to trade-offs.

PostHog and Amplitude both cover the essentials – analytics, experimentation, feature flags, session replay, and more – but their strengths show up in different places.

In this post, we'll cover these differences in more detail, comparing features, pricing, reporting, integrations, and the best fit for different use cases.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. Everything you need in one place

PostHog is the ultimate developer platform because it puts all your customer data in one place and combines it with every tool you need to build a successful product. This means:

-   [Product analytics](/product-analytics) for analyzing user behavior, funnels, activation, and retention
-   [Web analytics](/web-analytics) for traffic, campaigns, and content performance
-   [Session replay](/session-replay) for observing how people use your product and diagnosing problems
-   [Feature flags](/feature-flags) to test safely in production and ship new features with confidence
-   [Experiments](/experiments) to validate product and website improvements
-   [Error tracking](/error-tracking) for monitoring exceptions and problems in your code
-   [Surveys](/surveys) to capture user feedback, track NPS, and book interviews
-   [LLM analytics](/docs/llm-analytics) for gathering data on AI and LLM product usage and performance

In other words, it's everything you need in one app with a single login and contract. A _genuine_ single source of truth for your product and customer data.

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Receive an extra $50k in credits" type="fyi">

Companies that qualify for [PostHog's startup program](/startups) get $50,000 in PostHog credit and a range of additional benefits.

</CalloutBox>

### 2. It's a platform built for developers

This means you get support from the engineers who _actually build the product_, [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), and a [SQL query builder](/docs/product-analytics/sql), so you can analyze data how you want. Our code, culture, and strategy are public [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) and in our [public handbook](/handbook).

And as your needs grow, PostHog grows with you – advanced capabilities such as [a CDP](/cdp) or [data warehouse](/data-warehouse), are ready to switch on whenever you need them.

<CalloutBox icon="IconStarFilled" title="You'll be in good company" type="fyi">

Development teams at [Supabase](/customers/supabase), [Lovable](/customers/lovable), and [ElevenLabs](/customers/elevenlabs), and many more trust PostHog as they scale.

</CalloutBox>

### 3. Transparent pricing, generous free tiers

Our [pricing](/pricing) is 100% transparent. There are no hidden fees or surprise overages – what you see is exactly what you'll pay.

We also default to charging as little as possible while still making a sensible margin, and every product comes with a generous free tier. In fact, more than 90% of companies use PostHog for free!

<CalloutBox icon="IconPiggyBank" title="We love to cut prices" type="fyi">

In 2024, we [cut prices for session replay](/blog/session-replay-pricing) and [analytics events](/blog/analytics-pricing). In 2025, we've [cut prices for data pipelines](/blog/data-pipeline-pricing) and surveys. If we can cut pass a saving onto our customers, we always will.

        'web_analytics',
    ]}
/>

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Good to know" type="fyi">

PostHog supports [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), which means you can implement PostHog in mere minutes and ensure you don't miss out on events you haven't manually instrumented. Don't want autocapture? Just [turn it off](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#disabling-autocapture) – we offer the best of both worlds.

</CalloutBox>

### Feature flags

Both PostHog and Amplitude provide robust feature management tools, including boolean and multivariate flags, local evaluation, payloads, targeting, and percentage rollouts.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'amplitude']}
    rows={[
        {
            path: 'feature_flags.pricing.free_tier',

        'feature_flags.management.features.multi_environment',
        'feature_flags.features.early_access_management',
    ]}
/>

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Good to know" type="fyi">

PostHog's feature flags are tightly integrated with other features, so you can target session replays, surveys, and more using existing feature flags. See our guide on the [benefits of feature flags](/product-engineers/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) for more.

</CalloutBox>

### Experiments

Both PostHog and Amplitude support core experimentation features like A/B/n testing, multivariate tests, custom and secondary metrics, and statistical significance calculations. PostHog includes experiments in its free tier (1M requests per month, including mobile support). Most Amplitude Experiments features are locked behind paid plans.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'amplitude']}
    rows={[
        {
            path: 'experiments.pricing.free_tier',

        'experiments.analysis.features.statistics_engine',
    ]}
/>

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Good to know" type="fyi">

Amplitude's Web Experiments feature isn't available on any self-serve plan and the price isn't disclosed. You must contact its sales team to use it.

</CalloutBox>

### Session replay

Both PostHog and Amplitude offer session replay, but PostHog offers more features that are useful for developers, like console logs, DOM explorer, and performance monitoring.

<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'amplitude']}
    rows={[
        {
            path: 'session_replay.pricing.free_tier',

        'session_replay.export.export_to_video',
    ]}
/>

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Good to know" type="fyi">

Replays let you watch how users experience your app, diagnose issues, improve support, and understand real user behavior in a way raw data can't. They are reconstructions of the session, _not_ video recordings of user's screen. Private info, such as passwords, are masked.

</CalloutBox>

### Surveys

PostHog includes surveys out of the box, with 1,500 free responses per month and support for multiple formats like NPS, PMF, open text, and ratings, plus customization and targeting options. Amplitude provides surveys through its Guides & Surveys paid add-on.

### Price comparison

#### PostHog pricing philosophy

**PostHog charges based on usage**. Each product (analytics, session replay, feature flags, etc.) comes with a [generous free tier](/pricing), and once you exceed those limits you pay only for what you use.

Pricing is fully transparent and published publicly, with per-unit rates you can calculate in advance. You can also set billing caps per product to avoid unexpected costs.

This usage-based approach means costs scale with your actual activity, whether that's events, surveys, or recordings, rather than the number of users in your product. It also means you can easily reduce your bill by changing how you track users to send fewer events, or record fewer sessions.

#### Amplitude pricing philosophy

**Amplitude charges based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**. Each tracked user is counted once per month, regardless of how many events they generate. Plans scale as your MTUs grow, with higher tiers unlocking more advanced analytics, experimentation, and enterprise features.

This model can be easier to predict if you run a large product with millions of users, but it's less flexible because there's no way to reduce how much you spend. Every user is counted equally regardless of how valuable they are to you.

<CalloutBox icon="IconInfo" title="Example" type="fyi">

If you have 50,000 users who generate just a handful of events each month, usage-based pricing may be much lower than an MTU-based system, since your bill only scales with events sent. On the other hand, if those same users generate millions of events each, your costs will rise faster with an event-based model, while an MTU plan stays more predictable regardless of event volume.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Does PostHog offer a free trial?</summary>

We don't need to. Every customer gets a generous free usage allowance each month, so you can sign up and start using PostHog for nothing.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can PostHog replace Google Analytics?</summary>

Yes. PostHog can replace Google Analytics for many use cases – [our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing), for example. You can integrate PostHog into your website using [Google Tag Manager](/docs/libraries/google-tag-manager) and find an [easy-to-use web analytics dashboard](/web-analytics) in-app. See our comparison of [PostHog and Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) and [an intro to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog) for more.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Is PostHog easy to deploy?</summary>

Yes. Just paste our web snippet within the `<head>` tags your product or website and you're good to go in just a few minutes. This works for apps, blogs, scripts, no-code site builders, and more. See our [installation documentation](/docs/getting-started/install) for more options. We support dozens of client-side and server-side SDKs.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>How can I estimate my usage?</summary>

The easiest way is to [sign up to PostHog](https://us.posthog.com/signup), integrate our snippet, then check the projection on your billing page after a few days. Alternatively, you can guesstimate by multiplying your current monthly active users by an estimate of events generated per user – 50 to 100 per user is a good starting point. See [Estimating usage & costs](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) in our docs for more.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Does PostHog block bots by default?</summary>

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default). You need to manually enable bot blocking in Amplitude. This means event and DAU counts can look higher in Amplitude than PostHog.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can I use PostHog with a CDP? (Segment, Rudderstack, etc.)</summary>

Yes. See [Using PostHog with a CDP](/docs/advanced/cdp) in our docs.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does PostHog compare to other Amplitude alternatives?</summary>

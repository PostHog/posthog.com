Choosing the right analytics platform often comes down to trade-offs. PostHog and Amplitude both cover the essentials - analytics, experimentation, feature flags, session replay, and more â€“ but their strengths show up in different places.

In this post, we'll cover these differences in more detail, comparing features, pricing, reporting, integrations, and the best fit for different use cases.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. Everything you need in one place

PostHog is the ultimate developer platform. It puts all your customer data in one place and combines it with every tool you need to build a successful product. This means:

* [Product analytics](/product-analytics) for analyzing user behavior, funnels, activation, and retention  
* [Web analytics](/web-analytics) for traffic, campaigns, and content performance  
* [Session replay](/session-replay) for observing how people use your product and diagnosing problems  
* [Feature flags](/feature-flags) to test safely in production and ship new features with confidence  
* [Experiments](/experiments) to validate product and website improvements  
* [Error tracking](/error-tracking) for monitoring exceptions and problems in your code  
* [Surveys](/surveys) to capture user feedback, track NPS, and book interviews  
* A built-in [data warehouse](/data-warehouse) to combine product and business data in one place

In other words, it's everything you need in one app with a single login and contract. A *genuine* single source of truth for your product and customer data. And if something's missing today, it may be on the way tomorrow. We are [constantly shipping new products and features](/changelog) and you can see what's coming next (and even vote on it) in [our public roadmap](/roadmap).

### 2. It's a platform built for developers

This means you get support from the engineers who *actually build the product*, [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), and a [SQL query builder](/docs/product-analytics/sql), so you can analyze data how you want. Our code, culture, and strategy are public [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) and in our [public handbook](/handbook). 

Getting started is simple thanks to [SDKs](/docs/libraries), [tutorials](/tutorials), and [carefully written docs](/docs) to help you hit the ground running with any type of app. And as your needs grow, PostHog grows with you â€“ advanced capabilities such as [a CDP](/cdp) or [data warehouse](/data-warehouse), are ready to switch on whenever you need them.

> You'll be in good company â€“ teams at [Supabase](/customers/supabase), [Lovable](/customers/lovable), [ResearchGate](/customers/researchgate), Airbus, and many more trust PostHog.

### 3. Transparent, usage-based cheap pricing

We default to charging as little as possible while still making a profit, and have [repeatedly](/blog/session-replay-pricing) [rolled out](/blog/data-pipeline-pricing) [pricing decreases](/blog/analytics-pricing) to that end. Every product comes with a generous free tier, so you can start building without friction and only pay when your usage scales. **More than 90% of companies use PostHog for free!** 

Our [pricing](/pricing) is also 100% transparent. There are no hidden fees or surprise overages â€“ what you see is exactly what you'll pay. And unlike many SaaS tools, you don't need to book a call with sales or jump through hoops just to find out your costs, even our [enterprise discounts are public](/handbook/growth/sales/contract-rules#discounts). This means, no matter if you're a startup testing ideas or a larger team scaling rapidly, you'll always know where your spend stands.

> ðŸ’¡ Companies that qualify for [PostHog's startup program](/startups) also get $50,000 in PostHog credit and a range of additional benefits.

### Feature flags

Both PostHog and Amplitude provide robust feature flagging, supporting boolean and multivariate flags, local evaluation, payloads, targeting, and percentage rollouts. PostHog adds scheduling and early-access management, with pricing based on requests, while Amplitude's pricing is tied to impression (a difference that can affect flexibility as you roll out and scale).

<br />

### Experiments

Both PostHog and Amplitude support core experimentation features like A/B/n testing, multivariate tests, custom and secondary metrics, and statistical significance calculations. PostHog includes experiments in its free tier (1M requests per month, including mobile support), while Amplitude Experiment has much more experimentation features on paid tiers, focuses more on web, and uses sequential statistics.

> ðŸ’¡ **Good to know:** Amplitude's Web Experiments feature isn't available on any self-serve plan and the price isn't disclosed. You must contact its sales team to use it.

<br />

### Session replay

Both PostHog and Amplitude offer session replay with free tiers and heatmaps. PostHog extends this with mobile support, advanced controls (conditional recording, sampling, feature-flag targeting), and debugging tools like console logs, DOM explorer, and performance monitoring. Amplitude is limited to web heatmaps and basic replay, with fewer customization and diagnostic features.

</ComparisonTable>

> ðŸ’¡ **Good to know:** Replays let you watch how users experience your app, diagnose issues, improve support, and understand real user behavior in a way raw data can't. They are reconstructions of the session, _not_ video recordings of user's screen. Private info, such as passwords, are masked.

<br />

### Surveys

PostHog includes surveys out of the box, with 1,500 free responses per month and support for multiple formats like NPS, PMF, open text, and ratings, plus customization and targeting options. Amplitude provides surveys through its Guides & Surveys paid add-on.

<br />

## Price comparison

### PostHog pricing philosophy

**PostHog charges based on usage**. Each product (analytics, session replay, feature flags, etc.) comes with a [generous free tier](/pricing), and once you exceed those limits you pay only for what you use. Pricing is fully transparent and published publicly, with per-unit rates you can calculate in advance. You can also set billing caps per product to avoid unexpected costs.

This usage-based approach means costs scale with your actual activity, whether that's events, surveys, or recordings, rather than the number of users in your product.

### Amplitude pricing philosophy

**Amplitude charges based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**. Each tracked user is counted once per month, regardless of how many events they generate. Plans scale as your MTUs grow, with higher tiers unlocking more advanced analytics, experimentation, and enterprise features.

This model can be easier to predict if you run a large product with millions of users who generate relatively few events per person. It also means teams don't have to think about event volume when forecasting costs. However, it can feel less flexible if you're working with a smaller but more active user base, since a few highly engaged users won't change your MTU count.

> If you have 50,000 users who generate just a handful of events each month, usage-based pricing may be much lower than an MTU-based system, since your bill only scales with events sent. On the other hand, if those same users generate millions of events each, your costs will rise faster with an event-based model, while an MTU plan  stays more predictable regardless of event volume.

## So... which one is better, PostHog or Amplitude?

While both PostHog and Amplitude deliver on the core product analytics stack, the right choice varies on what you're optimizing for:

* **Best product analytics tool for startups: PostHog** â€“ generous free tiers, [$50k startup credits for eligible companies](/startups), usage-based pricing that keeps costs low, and a roadmap focused on building every product you need.  
* **Best for product managers and marketers: Amplitude** â€“ simpler interface, mature dashboards, and integrations that make it accessible to non-technical teams.  
* **Best for flexibility and cost control: PostHog** â€“ [usage-based pricing](/pricing), ability to cap spend, and transparent per-unit rates.  
* **Best for scaling B2C apps with very high MTUs: Amplitude** â€“ MTU-based pricing can be more predictable and cost-effective if you track millions of users with relatively few events.  
* **Best for engineers and technical founders: PostHog** â€“ open source, transparent roadmap, direct support from engineers, SQL access, and extensibility.  
* **Best for warehouse-native analytics: Amplitude** â€“ can run directly on top of your data warehouse, while PostHog syncs to/from warehouses but doesnâ€™t sit on top of them.  
* **Best for account-based analytics (B2B SaaS): PostHog** â€“ group/account analytics are included in the free plan, and [Revenue analytics](/docs/revenue-analytics/) *(beta)* lets SaaS teams connect tools like Stripe, track recurring revenue, and analyze top customers. Amplitude requires a paid add-on for account analytics.  
* **Best all-in-one platform: PostHog** â€“ combines web and product analytics, feature flags, replays, surveys, error tracking, and a data warehouse in one product.

Whichever you choose, setup is quick. Amplitude offers a polished SaaS experience with strong documentation and enterprise support. PostHog makes setup fast with a snippet or wizard install, automatic event capture, and templates (plus [AI assistance with MaxAI](/max)) to get insights running quickly.

### Can PostHog replace Google Analytics?

Yes. PostHog can replace Google Analytics for many use cases â€“ [our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing), for example. You can integrate PostHog into your website using [Google Tag Manager](/docs/libraries/google-tag-manager) and find an [easy-to-use web analytics dashboard](/web-analytics) in-app. See our comparison of [PostHog and Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) and [an intro to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog) for more.

### Is PostHog easy to deploy?

Yes. Just paste our web snippet within the `<head>` tags your product or website and you're good to go in just a few minutes. This works for apps, blogs, scripts, no-code site builders, and more. See our [installation documentation](/docs/getting-started/install) for more options. We support dozens of client-side and server-side SDKs.

### How can I estimate my usage?

The easiest way is to [sign up to PostHog](https://us.posthog.com/signup), integrate our snippet, then check the projection on your billing page after a few days. Alternatively, you can guesstimate by multiplying your current monthly active users by an estimate of events generated per user â€“ 50 to 100 per user is a good starting point. See [Estimating usage & costs](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) in our docs for more.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default). You need to manually enable bot blocking in Amplitude. This means event and DAU counts can look higher in Amplitude than PostHog.

### Can I use PostHog with a CDP? (Segment, Rudderstack, etc.)

Yes. See [Using PostHog with a CDP](/docs/advanced/cdp) in our docs.

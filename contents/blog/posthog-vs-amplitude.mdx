PostHog and Amplitude both help product teams understand user behavior, run experiments, manage feature flags, replay sessions, and make informed decisions.

When deciding on the right option for you, there are a few differences worth considering:

1. Not all free tiers are created equal. PostHog includes 1M events, 5,000 session recordings, and 1,500 surveys each month. Amplitude's Starter plan covers 50k tracked users (which can work out to more total events, depending on usage), but only up to 1,000 recordings and no free surveys.  
2. [PostHog is open source](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools), so developers can inspect the code, customize, and extend functionality. Engineers also rotate weekly as “support heroes,” meaning the people building the product help customers directly. Amplitude is closed-source and offers support through a more traditional model.  
3. PostHog's pricing is usage-based, with costs scaling according to events, sessions recorded, flag requests, and other usage. Amplitude's pricing is tiered and primarily tied to monthly tracked users (MTUs), with costs increasing as that number grows. 

In this post, we'll cover these differences in more detail, comparing features, pricing, reporting, integrations, and the best fit for different use cases.

## Why PostHog?

### 1. Everything you need in one place

PostHog puts all your customer data in one place and combines it with every tool you need to build a successful product. This means:

* [Session replay](/session-replay) for observing how people use your product and diagnosing problems  
* [Feature flags](/feature-flags) to test safely in production and ship new features with confidence  
* [Experiments](/experiments) to validate product and website improvements  
* [Error tracking](/error-tracking) for monitoring exceptions and problems in your code  
* [Product analytics](/product-analytics) for analyzing user behavior, funnels, activation, and retention  
* [Web analytics](/web-analytics) for traffic, campaigns, and content performance  
* [Surveys](/surveys) to capture user feedback, track NPS, and book interviews  
* A built-in [data warehouse](/data-warehouse) to combine product and business data in one place

In other words, it's everything you need in one app with a single login and contract. A *genuine* single source of truth for your product and customer data. And if something's missing today, it may be on the way tomorrow. We are [constantly shipping new products and features](/changelog) and you can see what's coming next (and even vote on it) in [our public roadmap](/roadmap).

### 2. By developers, for developers

This means you get support from the engineers who *actually build the product*, [extensively documented APIs](/docs/api), and a [SQL query builder](/docs/product-analytics/sql), so you can analyze data how you want. Our code, culture, and strategy are public [on GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) and in our [public handbook](/handbook). Getting started is simple thanks to [SDKs](/docs/libraries), [tutorials](/tutorials), and [carefully written docs](/docs) to help you hit the ground running with any type of app. And as your needs grow, PostHog grows with you – advanced capabilities such as [a CDP](/cdp) or [data warehouse](/data-warehouse), are ready to switch on whenever you need them.

> You'll be in good company – teams at [Supabase](/customers/supabase), [Lovable](/customers/lovable), [ResearchGate](/customers/researchgate), Airbus, and many more trust PostHog.

<br />

### 3. Transparent, usage-based cheap pricing

We default to charging as little as possible while still making a profit, and have [repeatedly](/blog/session-replay-pricing) [rolled out](/blog/data-pipeline-pricing) [pricing decreases](/blog/analytics-pricing) to that end. Every product comes with a generous free tier, so you can start building without friction and only pay when your usage scales. **More than 90% of companies use PostHog for free!** 

Our [pricing](/pricing) is also 100% transparent. There are no hidden fees or surprise overages – what you see is exactly what you'll pay. And unlike many SaaS tools, you don't need to book a call with sales or jump through hoops just to find out your costs, even our [enterprise discounts are public](/handbook/growth/sales/contract-rules#discounts). This means, no matter if you're a startup testing ideas or a larger team scaling rapidly, you'll always know where your spend stands.

> 💡 Companies that qualify for [PostHog's startup program](/startups) also get $50,000 in PostHog credit and a range of additional benefits.

</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** PostHog supports [autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), which means you can implement PostHog in mere minutes and ensure you don't miss out on events you haven't manually instrumented. Don't want autocapture? Just [turn it off](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture#disabling-autocapture) – we offer the best of both worlds.

### Feature flags

Both PostHog and Amplitude provide robust feature flagging, supporting boolean and multivariate flags, local evaluation, payloads, targeting, and percentage rollouts. PostHog adds scheduling and early-access management, with pricing based on requests, while Amplitude's pricing is tied to impression (a difference that can affect flexibility as you roll out and scale).

    <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Early access" description="Manage betas, test features" />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** PostHog's feature flags are tightly integrated with other features, so you can target session replays, surveys, and more using existing feature flags. See our guide on the [benefits of feature flags](/product-engineers/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) for more.

<br />

### Experiments

Both PostHog and Amplitude support core experimentation features like A/B/n testing, multivariate tests, custom and secondary metrics, and statistical significance calculations. PostHog includes experiments in its free tier (1M requests per month, including mobile support), while Amplitude Experiment has much more experimentation features on paid tiers, focuses more on web, and uses sequential statistics.

> 💡 **Good to know:** Amplitude's Web Experiments feature isn't available on any self-serve plan and the price isn't disclosed. You must contact its sales team to use it.

<br />

### Session replay

Both PostHog and Amplitude offer session replay with free tiers and heatmaps. PostHog extends this with mobile support, advanced controls (conditional recording, sampling, feature-flag targeting), and debugging tools like console logs, DOM explorer, and performance monitoring. Amplitude is limited to web heatmaps and basic replay, with fewer customization and diagnostic features.

    />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Replays let you watch how users experience your app, diagnose issues, improve support, and understand real user behavior in a way raw data can't. They are reconstructions of the session, _not_ video recordings of user's screen. Private info, such as passwords, are masked.

<br />

### Surveys

PostHog includes surveys out of the box, with 1,500 free responses per month and support for multiple formats like NPS, PMF, open text, and ratings, plus customization and targeting options. Amplitude does not currently offer surveys as part of its platform.

PostHog charges for usage – i.e. analytics events, recorded replays, and so on. **Amplitude** charges based on monthly tracked users (MTUs).

In the comparison, we're assuming 75 identified events per monthly tracked user (MTU), which is the typical usage for most PostHog users, though many customers send less than this.

We also provide numerous ways to [control how many events you send](/tutorials/fewer-unwanted-events) and reduce your costs, including the option to send cheaper **anonymous events**.

### Identified vs anonymous events

Anonymous events **only include non-identifying data**, such as referral data (UTMs, domains, etc), device type, and basic location information.

They're useful if you're tracking a huge number of users and only want to analyze aggregate data, such as on a content website with millions of visitors.

Anonymous events are cheaper for us to ingest, so we charge you between 55% and 80% less for them. You'll only be charged the identified event rate when you call identifying functions like `posthog.identify()` or `posthog.group()`, or capture an event from an already-identified user.

## TL;DR: Which one is better, PostHog or Amplitude?

Both tools cover the core product analytics stack, but the right choice varies depending on what you're optimizing for:

**Best product analytics tool for startups: PostHog** – generous free tiers, $50k startup credits for eligible companies, and usage-based pricing keep costs low as you grow.

**Best for teams with limited engineering resources: Amplitude** – polished SaaS setup with strong documentation and established enterprise support.

**Best for engineers and technical founders: PostHog** – open source, transparent roadmap, direct support from engineers, SQL access, and extensibility.

**Best for account-based analytics (B2B SaaS): PostHog** – group/account analytics included in the free plan, while Amplitude requires a paid add-on.

**Best for classic marketing analytics:** **Amplitude** – mature dashboards and integrations designed for large product/marketing teams.

**Best for flexibility and cost control**: **PostHog** – usage-based pricing, ability to cap spend, and transparent per-unit rates.

**Best all-in-one platform: **PostHog** – combines analytics, feature flags, replays, surveys, error tracking, and a data warehouse in one product.

**Best for scaling consumer apps with very high MTUs:** **Amplitude** – MTU-based plans may be more predictable if you track millions of users with relatively few events.

### Does PostHog offer a free trial?

We don't need to. Every customer gets a generous free usage allowance each month, so you can sign up and start using PostHog for nothing. Here's how PostHog and Amplitude's free tiers compare:

### Can PostHog replace Google Analytics?

Yes. PostHog can replace Google Analytics for many use cases – [our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing), for example. You can integrate PostHog into your website using [Google Tag Manager](/docs/libraries/google-tag-manager) and find an [easy-to-use web analytics dashboard](/web-analytics) in-app. See our comparison of [PostHog and Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) and [an intro to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog) for more.

### Is PostHog easy to deploy?

Yes. Just paste our web snippet within the `<head>` tags your product or website and you're good to go in just a few minutes. This works for apps, blogs, scripts, no-code site builders, and more. See our [installation documentation](/docs/getting-started/install) for more options. We support dozens of client-side and server-side SDKs.

### How can I estimate my usage?

The easiest way is to [sign up to PostHog](https://us.posthog.com/signup), integrate our snippet, then check the projection on your billing page after a few days. Alternatively, you can guesstimate by multiplying your current monthly active users by an estimate of events generated per user – 50 to 100 per user is a good starting point. See [Estimating usage & costs](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) in our docs for more.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default). You need to manually enable bot blocking in Amplitude. This means event and DAU counts can look higher in Amplitude than PostHog.

### Can I use PostHog with a CDP? (Segment, Rudderstack, etc.)

Yes. See [Using PostHog with a CDP](/docs/advanced/cdp) in our docs.

### How does PostHog compare to other Amplitude alternatives?

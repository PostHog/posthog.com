TODO Add intro about Tigris and introduce Ovais

> Blurb about PostHog for Startups spotlighting a new startup every month. 

### What is Tigris and why is it cool?

Yeah. Tigris is a developer data platform that provides an integrated suite of data services that are needed by application developers to build data-driven applications. These services include NoSQL database for storing structured and unstructured data, and an integrated search engine that allows users to do both full-text searches as well as vector searches. So, these are the two data services that we have developed right now, but there are more that we would be developing. Those include event streaming and caching.

The reason for choosing these data services is because most of the real-time applications that are built, they require a combination of these services. These are common services that are needed. So think of an e-commerce application. It needs a way to store the product data, store the user data, store the orders-management data, right? So it needs a database. And the products are generally of different types, of different number of attributes. So it needs some kind of database that supports dynamic schema, so NoSQL database is good there. Then, an e-commerce application also requires a way to search through the product. So give the users a way to search through the product, either by searching using keywords or by providing recommendations. When, for example, someone is typing for chili, show them other types of hot sauces as well. So, these type of services are very common in dynamic applications, and e-commerce applications is a good example of it.

And what we are trying to do is, instead of having the developer deal with bespoke solutions or specific solutions and having them deal with connecting all of these together and having a complex infrastructure, you're providing them an integrated way so that the developer focuses just on writing the application code, just focuses on writing their business logic, and we take care of all of the infrastructure related to data storage and access.

### How did you decide this was a problem worth solving?

I have been in the database space, data-infrastructure space for 17 years now. Before starting Tigris, I spent around 6 years at Uber and I was leading the teams that were building Uber's internal database platform. So, this was a problem that I had seen in previous jobs. But at Uber, this was something that was, again, very clear that a lot of the developer time was going in dealing with different type of solutions, connecting them together. So essentially, dealing more with operational infrastructure instead of focusing on writing features fast enough.

So, this was a problem that was clear at Uber, as well. And at Uber, we built a solution to address this problem. We built a solution called Docstore, which is essentially, I would say, a similar type of product, which integrates many different data-access platforms together behind a single API. And that allowed Uber to move really fast, build new types of use cases. This experience helped us to envision a product that would benefit other developers outside as well. And that's how Tigris started. I started Tigris with two other formal work colleagues.

### Who is Tigris for?

We are looking at early- to mid-stage enterprises. Both of these enterprises have kind of similar pain points. So when we're talking about an early-stage startup, if they adopt Tigris, they don't have to deal with infrastructure complexity right from the beginning. They're building a new product, new project, they can start building on Tigris and they don't have to deal with the infrastructure and they can continue moving very quickly.

When you're talking about mid-stage startup, mid-stage enterprises, these are companies that... At that kind of scale, what typically happens is that when those companies started small, they chose some solution to build a product. And most of the time, they end up choosing many different solutions. So when they reach a certain scale, they hit the same issue. Again, at that point, what they have to do is they typically rewrite the application, and that's another point where Tigris can come in. And as you're re-architecting application, you're having scaling challenges as you're having infrastructure complexity. Tigris can help you with take away all of that burden and allow you to build a modern application stack.

### What are you most excited about?

The first thing I'm most excited about is actually about building, the opportunity to build. I personally enjoy building. I put myself in that category of builder. In the past, I've built internal platforms. So this is the first opportunity to build something that end users are going to use directly. So, while at Uber, our platform was... in the critical parts, if it is down, then you cannot order anything from a restaurant or you cannot order a ride. But we were still behind the scenes. I was not dealing with customers directly. So, this is the first opportunity that excites me, that the product that you're building and actually selling that product itself directly, and we get to talk to users and customers, and that's the thing that excites me the most.

### What are you worried about?

The same thing stresses me out, as well, building all by yourself, running a company. Running a company is not easy. My background is more of an engineering and management background. I didn't have that diverse of a background to say that I know everything that a company needs. For example, you need sales, you need marketing, we need operations, we need to talk to users and customers, and that requires a certain type of skill set. So, generally, it is stressful, but I think it's good stress. There's a lot of learning experience, doing things that I have not done before. So that's a good experience. But of course, there are so many things that are going on, there's so much context switching that needs to happen, because you have to wear a lot of hats. That does cause stress.

Things like banks going bust don't help either! Things that you would never imagine happening. I mean, it resolved, but the three days, it was like, certainly I'm bankrupt or the company's bankrupt, for nothing that we did. No reason that tied to us. So, those kind of circumstances, as well. So, it is definitely a different type of an experience.

### What's one thing you wish you had known at the beginning when you started out?

There are several learnings that we have had through the course of the startup journey. Initially, during the start of the journey, when I was raising money, I was working on raising money, there were learnings that came about doing that process as well. Like I said, I have engineering background. So when I was pitching the product, I was pitching it more from an engineering perspective, meaning that how good of architecture it is, how cost cost-effective it is. And then I had to switch over to talking more about the business aspects of it, how is it solving a problem, who is it solving the problem for, how is it different from what other products exist. So, that introduced a different kind of thought process. It's not that we didn't know who the ICP were, but still we were thinking like an engineer and thinking more about the product from engineering perspectives. And the biggest change is that we now think from a user perspective, that what is the problem that we are solving. And then that is what helps us decide what to focus on. That side, that I would say is the biggest learning.

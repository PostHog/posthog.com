Want to understand the difference between Hotjar and PostHog? Here's the short answer:

1. **Hotjar** is a user research tool that offers session replays, heatmaps, and tools for collecting feedback and scheduling customer interviews. It's built for marketers and user experience (UX) researchers.

2. **PostHog** is an all-in-one platform for building successful products. It includes product analytics, session replays, feature flags, in-app prompts, and more. It's built for engineers and product teams.

Now it's time for the long answer...

In this guide, we'll cover:

- [Hotjar and PostHog feature comparison](#core-features)
- [Session replays](#session-replays) 
- [Heatmaps](#heatmaps)
- [Product analytics](#product-analytics)
- [In-app messages and user research](#in-app-messages-and-user-research)
- [Apps and integrations](#apps-and-integrations)
- [Pricing](#how-much-does-hotjar-cost)

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. PostHog is an all-in one platform

Hotjar focuses mainly on session replays, heatmaps, and user research. That means you need to adopt additional tools for things like [product analytics](/product-analytics), [feature management](/feature-flags), and [A/B testing](/ab-testing). PostHog integrates all these features into one platform (in addition to [session replays and heatmaps](/session-replay)).

### 2. PostHog is built for engineers

PostHog integrates powerful features that aren’t available in Hotjar and which are designed for technical users, such as feature flags with JSON payloads, which enable you to trigger in-app messages, or other notifications. 

We built PostHog to support technically-savvy product managers and engineers – especially [engineers with a product focus in their role](/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer). Anyone can use PostHog ([just ask our marketing team](/blog/posthog-marketing)), but our primary goal is to give engineers the tools they need to ship impactful features at speed.

### 3. PostHog is open source

Because we build for engineers first, we're also open source. You can check out [PostHog’s source code](https://github.com/PostHog), [build integrations](/docs/apps/build) or [other services](/blog/how-we-built-an-app-server) on top of the product, and even [give feedback or interact with the team via GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog). Transparency, including transparent pricing, is one of our core values.

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Feature flags" description="Roll out features safely; toggle features for cohorts or individuals." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="A/B testing" description="Test changes and analyze impact." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="In-app prompts and messages" description="Send messages to users in your app." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Surveys" description="Capture user feedback with surveys." />

</ComparisonTable>

- **Session replays:** [Session replays](/session-replay) in PostHog recreate exactly what real users see and how they use your product. They also enable you to debug problems using built-in [console logs](/docs/session-replay/manual#console-logs-recording), [performance monitoring](/tutorials/performance-metrics) and the [DOM explorer](/blog/posthog-changelog#experimental-dom-explorer-mode).

- **Feature flags:** PostHog includes [multivariate feature flags](/feature-flags) that support JSON payloads. Teams can use feature flags to offer different features or UI choices to users, to trigger in-app messages, and more.

- **A/B testing:** In PostHog, you can use the [experimentation suite](/ab-testing) to create multivariate tests within your product, such as showing some users a different page layout to others. Over time, you can build an understanding of which page performs better, correlate results with other events, and deploy a final version.

### Session replays

Session replays are an essential tool for understanding how people use your product, especially for [early-stage companies](/blog/early-stage-analytics) searching for product-market fit.

Both Hotjar and PostHog offer session replays:

<ComparisonTable column1="Hotjar" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1="~1k per month (max 35 per day) on Basic plan" column2="5,000/mo" feature="Free replay allowance" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="~$200 per month (max 1.5k sessions per day)" column2="$175/mo" feature="Price for first 50k sessions" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Browser app replays" description="Watch real users use your product." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Connected to product analytics" description="View replays for specific users and events." />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Only in Scale plan" column2={true} feature="Console logs" description="Debug user problems and app errors." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Performance monitoring" description="Monitor network activity and performance" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2="Alpha" feature="iOS app replays" description="Record user sessions in iOS apps." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2="Planned Q1 2024" feature="Android app replays" description="Record user sessions in Android apps." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Custom playlists" description="Create playlists of related replays." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Download replays" description="Save replay files offline for storage." />
</ComparisonTable>

- **Recording retention:** Hotjar keeps all replays for 365 days. PostHog retains all replays for up to three months, but retains replays saved to a playlist forever. PostHog also enables you to download replays as a `.json` file for safe keeping.

### Heatmaps

Heatmaps visualize user activity in your app. They use colors or numbers to show which parts of the page people are interacting with the most. Both Hotjar and PostHog offer heatmaps, although PostHog's offering is more limited:

<ComparisonTable column1="Hotjar" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Click and tap heatmaps" description="Show where users are clicking." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Move heatmaps" description="Show where users have moved their mouse on the screen." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Scroll heatmaps" description="Show how far down the page your users scroll." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Rage clicks" description="Show where users repeatedly click in a short period of time." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Combine rage click data with product analytics" description="View related events and funnel data for users who rage click." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Heatmap data filters" description="Filter heatmaps by date, country etc." />
</ComparisonTable>

### Product analytics

Although product analytics is not a core focus for Hotjar, they do offer basic features, such as event tracking, funnels, and trend insights. However, these are **only available on Hotjar's Observe Scale plan**, and their offering is more limited than PostHog's:


<ComparisonTable column1="Hotjar" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Event tracking" description="Log page views, clicks and other custom events." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Trends" description="Track your data over time and visualize in charts." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Funnels" description="Visualize conversion rates and drop-offs." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Display a collection of insights and trends." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Correlation analysis" description="Automatically highlight factors affecting funnel conversion rates." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Group events by users in the same company, project, or any other attribute." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Lifecycle insights" description="Break down events from new, returning, resurrecting, and dormant users." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Retention insights" description="Understand churn with returning user actions." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Stickiness insights" description="See how many times users perform an event in a period of time." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Path insights" description="Inspect how users journey through your product." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Toolbar" description="View insights on your live website or app with an overlay." />
</ComparisonTable>

### In-app messages and user research

Hotjar includes feedback widgets, surveys, and an integrated user research tool for gathering feedback from users. PostHog also offers user surveys, including the ability to customize the appearance of prompts to match your product.

PostHog also offers additional ways to communicate with your users, such as a [notification bar](/apps/notification-bar) and interactive [pop-ups](/tutorials/react-popups) through the use of [feature flag payloads](/docs/feature-flags/payloads), and [site apps](/tutorials/build-site-app). Also, since PostHog provides product analytics, you can easily define your target users who should see your widgets.

The main difference is, because Hotjar is designed for less technical users, it offers an interface that is simpler, but less powerful. You can easily create surveys and feedback widgets in Hotjar, but not other types of prompt such as a Calendly integration. In PostHog, it's possible to create such surveys easily.

Below, we've listed the different methods for communicating with and collecting user feedback in Hotjar and PostHog.

<ComparisonTable column1="Hotjar" column2="PostHog">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Collect text input" description="Suggestion box on your site where users can express frustration or delight." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Schedule customer interviews" description="Send users a link to schedule a feedback meeting." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Custom user targeting" description="Define who should see your widgets with your own data." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Surveys" description="Capture user feedback with surveys." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="User interview recordings and transcriptions" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Notification bar" description="Display a customized banner on your site." />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="In-app popups" description="Highlight features in your app." />
</ComparisonTable>

### Apps and integrations
Both Hotjar and PostHog have a wide selection of apps and integrations. Both also include integrations with tools such as Zapier, which enable you to move data to even more platforms.

One unique advantage of PostHog is that, because it is open source, it’s easy to [create your own apps and integrations](/tutorials/build-your-own-posthog-app). This is useful if you’re, for example, using niche software in your stack that hasn’t been widely adopted, or if you require a direct integration between PostHog and your product. 


Below, we've listed a few of the most popular integrations used across PostHog and HotJar. PostHog offers more than 50 apps, so for a full list of PostHog's integrations, please [check the app library](/apps).

### Who is Hotjar useful for?

Hotjar is designed primarily for marketers and UX specialists. Its key features are the ability to record session replays and heatmaps. It also provides widgets for collecting feedback and tools for scheduling customer interviews. These provide insights into how customers are using your product. 

### Who is PostHog useful for?

PostHog is built primarily with engineers, product managers and other technical users in mind. It also offers the ability to record session replays, heatmaps, and create feedback widgets, but also offers a number of other tools that are useful for these types of teams, such as product analytics and feature flags. 

This difference is ultimately reflected in many of the features both platforms offer, and how they are designed. PostHog's focus on breadth and supporting engineers in creating better products, for example, is reflected in its core features. 

### How much does Hotjar cost?

Hotjar has a complex pricing structure: There are three different plans: Observe, Ask, and Engage. Each plan consists of four tiers: Basic, Plus, Business and Scale. Each plan offers discounts for annual subscriptions.

Not all features are available on every tier and plan. Below is a breakdown of which features are available on each plan, as well as their cost:

#### Hotjar Observe features and pricing

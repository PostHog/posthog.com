_**Disclaimer:** This is intended as a short, tactical guide to getting your trademarks sorted out for the first time, on a minimal budget. This is *not* legal advice and we are not lawyers - this is just what has worked for us._

Don't bother securing your trademarks in the early days of your business - wait until you've raised a seed round first.

If you're yet to raise a pre-seed round, the money you'd spend on IP lawyers could probably be better spent elsewhere. Those first crucial months present bigger problems to worry about - like finding product-market fit, hiring more (and better) people, improving your quality control, ramping up your marketing and [content](https://posthog.com/blog/running-content-at-posthog), and more. There's also a good chance that your brand might evolve during that time - from name changes and logo revamps to brand fonts and colors. This makes trademarking a word mark or logo mark _that_ early a risky bet.

## What is the different between a word mark and a logo mark?

A word mark is typically just the name of the brand (as written in a specific font, if applicable). In our case, it's the word 'PostHog.' A logo mark is typically pictorial - in our case, the hedgehog logo either alone or combined with a stylized word (see below). The word mark is the most versatile, so that should be your first trademark priority.

When you decide to register your trademark, you don't need to spend a fortune doing it. With a tactical combination of using the right type of lawyer and doing it yourself, you should be able to get trademarks filed in the US, UK, EU and China for ~$3,000.

(Why China? Even if you're not doing business there today, China operates a 'first to file' rule for trademarks, rather than 'first use,' which means whoever registers the trademark there first gets to keep it. Great for IP trolls - not so great for you.)

We’ve currently secured our brand name ('PostHog') and word mark in the four territories listed above. The process differs slightly for each region:
1. **US:** Hire a trademark attorney to do it for you (necessary if you live outside the US). If you go the latter route, get a fixed-fee service provider and avoid getting charged by the hour. We used [Cognition IP](https://www.cognitionip.com/).
2. **UK:** File it yourself through the [UK Intellectual Property Office](https://www.gov.uk/topic/intellectual-property/trade-marks)’s easy to use website. It’s much faster this way than hiring a trademarks and IP lawyer to do it for you.
3. **EU:** If you reside in the European Union, you can simply file the trademark yourself via the [EU IPO website](https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/apply-now) If you’re outside the EU, you'll need to hire an agent to do it for you. The EU IPO website lists a number of agents you can choose from.
4. **China:** Hire a reputable agent on the mainland to do it for you (we used [Anli Partners](http://www.anlilaw.com/100040/). Remember, you have to be the [first to file](https://www.iam-media.com/trademarks/trademark-application-process-in-mainland-china) the trademark otherwise your application will be rejected.

## Should open source companies trademark their brand names?

The phrase 'open source' might denote a public codebase, but a brand name can definitely be trademarked. For example, we want people to [deploy our community edition](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog) wherever they please, but we don't wish anyone to slap the 'PostHog' name on random products. As such, registering trademarks is necessary. Besides, if you’re [raising money](https://posthog.com/blog/open-source-business-models) for your open source startup, IP forms part of what you parcel out to investors - and they'll need to see evidence of owned rights to the product and brand name. Make sure you have them ready.

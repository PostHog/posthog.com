We raised over $27,000,000 then realized we should be growing out of our own revenue instead.

## Day 1 - we started bootstrapping, then changed our minds

Fresh-faced, but not carefree - in the early days, when it was just my cofounder Tim and me, we used to work out of caf√©s and we were bootstrapped.

A few months in, we had a discussion on what we wanted out of life. Pro tip - do this _before_ you start working with someone else. Luckily we were on the same page - we decided it was _more_ stressful to bootstrap than to raise VC.

Why?

* No money coming in meant we were having to be exceptioanlly careful about spending.
* We'd spend years rebuilding to the same salaries that we'd just left behind, but with added downside risk of not finding product market fit.
* A slower pace felt like it'd be boring. We'd find it more engaging to own a smaller slice of a bigger pie. We wanted to work on something we'd enjoy.

The YCombinator application was coming up, so we went for it. We got in.

## Raising money got intoxicating

We raised a seed round fairly painfully (March 2020...). Then a Series A super quickly (a month later), then a B super duper quickly (about 6 months later, announced way after it happened).

Raising money, especially coming into 2021, felt self fulfilling. It felt like you're _either_ the type of company that raises a ton, or one that struggles. So we'd better keep raising. This was the hype loop we felt was happening:

1. Founder: Check it out, we raised tons of money
2. VC: Whoah, that's some compelling social proof! You're now on our radar.
3. Users: We should pick _this_ technology since they're featured in techcrunch with a huge funding round!
4. Founder: We should keep raising. Maybe even sell a few $MM in secondaries way ahead of being an obvious success.
5. VC: Interest rates are low... let's do it.
6. Go back to step 1 (until founder raises too much, has big unweildy team and no product market fit, with high burn, has to fire people and will struggle to raise again)

## What happened next - the PostHog dark ages / turns out board meetings are very important

Things got a bit messy.

We'd hired quite a bit. We didn't really have revenue but didn't really care about that, yet. We did have lots of users.

At the same time:

* customers wanted a paid version of the product (asking for extra features or for us to host the product for them)
* tons of the world's best investors were trying to talk to us
* my daughter got cancer (she's now doing well thankfully)

I wanted to keep working, but it meant I had to look after my daughter. I felt that if I tried to sell _and_ fundraise, I'd do both badly.

We figured it was an existential problem not to have revenue, and that it'd be easier to figure it out now instead of when we're bigger.

I couldn't be more glad that's what we picked. Results:

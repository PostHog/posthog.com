## How is PostHog different?

### 1. We're built for engineers

What does this mean?

- It means [we ship fast](/changelog) and iterate based on user feedback.
- It means engineers do support – all product teams have a [weekly support hero](/handbook/engineering/support-hero).
- It means we have extensive [public and private API endpoints](/docs/api), and a powerful [SQL query builder](/docs/hogql).
- It means we built [SDKs](/docs/libraries) for all popular (and many unpopular) client-side, backend, and mobile languages and frameworks.
- It means we make it easy to [test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production), conduct [phased rollouts](/tutorials/phased-rollout), run [beta programs](/tutorials/public-beta-program), and so much more.

### 2. We're an all-in-one platform

Heap is mainly focused on product analytics. This means you need to adopt additional tools for things like feature management, experiments, and surveys. They're all built into PostHog – we even have a built-in data warehouse that [integrates with Stripe](/tutorials/stripe-reports) and [Hubspot](/tutorials/hubspot-reports). You can replace half a dozen tools with PostHog, save money, and get more from your data.

### 3. We're totally transparent

- How much will PostHog cost? Use our [pricing calculator](/pricing). 
- What are we working on? It's on our [public roadmap](/roadmap)? 
- How does sales work? We have a [whole page on it](/sales).
- What do we care about? We explain everything in our [public company handbook](/handbook).
- How do we make money? That's [in the handbook](/handbook/how-we-make-money), too.

Oh, we're open source, too. Go take a peak at our code if you like on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/PostHog).

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Build your own apps and contribute code" />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** PostHog can replace multiple tools, such as [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar), [Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4), and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly). This makes it a lot easier to extract usable insights, since you don't have to constantly switch between tools. Running PostHog on both your product and website makes it easier to understand how marketing activity influences signups and usage, too. 

### Product analytics

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Heap">
  <ComparisonRow column1="1 million events" column2="10k monthly tracked users" feature="Free usage" description="How much free usage do you get each month?" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual logging" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="SQL query editor" description="Write your own queries in SQL" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="AI insight builder" description="'Talk to your data' using AI" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Group analytics" description="Track metrics at a company and account level" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Dashboards" description="Combine insights into shareable dashboards" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cohorts" description="Combine users based on properties and events for group analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Lifecycle analysis" description="Understand who is dormant, churning, and thriving" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Stickiness" description="Find out what events keep users coming back." />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know** Every PostHog user gets [1 million events for free](/pricing) each month. You can also save money by sending us anonymous events for non-identified users, which are up to 80% cheaper than identified product analytics events. Anonymous events are ideal for tracking behavior on marketing websites, or mobile apps with large consumer audiences. See our docs on [anonymous vs identified events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) for more.

### Session replays

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Heap">
  <ComparisonRow column1="5,000 web recordings, 2,500 mobile recordings" column2="Limited trial" feature="Free usage" description="How much free usage do you get each month?" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web app recordings" description="Capture recordings from single-page apps" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Mobile app recordings" description="Capture recordings in iOS and Android apps" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Identity detection" description="Link recordings to user IDs" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Console logs" description="Capture extra content from a user's browser" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Playlists" description="Sort recordings into static and dynamic playlists" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Performance monitoring" description="Track network events within a session" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Privacy masking" description="Censor personal information from playback" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Conditional capture" description="Only capture the sessions you want" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="DOM explorer" description="Explore an interactive snapshot of replays" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Export recordings" description="Save important recordings offline" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Minimum duration" description="Only record sessions longer than the minimum duration" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Sample recorded sessions" description="Restrict the percentage of sessions that will be recorded" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Record via feature flag" description="Only record sessions for users that have the flag enabled" />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Session replays are an essential tool for understanding how people use your product, especially for [early-stage companies](/blog/early-stage-analytics) searching for [product-market fit](/founders/product-market-fit-game). Both Heap and PostHog offer session replay, though Heap lacks many developer-facing features like a DOM explorer, performance monitoring, and network events, which are useful for fixing bugs and performance issues.

### Feature flags

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Heap">
  <ComparisonRow column1="1 million API requests" column2="n/a" feature="Free usage" description="How much free usage do you get each month?" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Boolean flags" description="Simple flags returning true or flag" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Multivariate flags" description="Flags with multiple customizable values" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Payloads" description="Flags with string, number, or JSON payloads" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Local evaluation" description="Store flag definitions locally" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Percentage rollouts" description="Target percentages of a group" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Custom targeting" description="Target users based on user properties, custom contexts" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Partial" column2={false} feature="Environments" description="Manage flags for dev, staging, prod" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Scheduling" description="Schedule flags to turn on or off" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Bootstrapping" description="Flags available on frontend application load" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Early access" description="Manage betas, test features" />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Feature flags make it easy to roll out features to specific users or groups, and [safely test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production). Our feature flags are also tightly integrated with other features so you can target session replays, surveys, and more using existing feature flags. See our guide on the [benefits of feature flags](/product-engineers/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) for more.

  <ComparisonRow column1="Bayesian" column2="n/a" feature="Statistics engine" description="How the results of an experiment are calculated" />
</ComparisonTable>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Our experiments integrate seamlessly with our feature flag product. This means you can easily deploy the winning variant of an experiment with a single click from the experiment UI.

### Security and compliance

<ComparisonTable column1="PostHog" column2="Heap">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="User privacy options" description="Anonymize users, drop personal data" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="History, audit logs" description="Manage and view flag edits and related users" />

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I migrate from Heap?

Yes. See our [Heap to PostHog migration guide](/docs/migrate/heap) for more.

### How long does it take to deploy PostHog?

Deploying PostHog takes mere minutes. Just [include our tracking snippet](/docs/integrate?tab=snippet) in your product or website and (thanks to autocapture) you're immediately capturing events. Once up and running, you can enable session replays and other features via your project settings. See our guide to [getting started on PostHog Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud) for more info.

### Can PostHog also replace Google Analytics?

Yes. PostHog can replace Google Analytics for many use cases – [our marketing team uses PostHog](/blog/posthog-marketing), for example. You can integrate PostHog into your website using [Google Tag Manager](/docs/libraries/google-tag-manager). See our comparison of [PostHog and Google Analytics 4](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) and [an intro to PostHog for Google Analytics users](/blog/google-analytics-to-posthog) for more.

### How can I estimate my usage?

The easiest way is to [sign up to PostHog](https://us.posthog.com/signup), integrate our snippet, then check the projection on your billing page after a few days. Alternatively, you can guesstimate by multiplying your current monthly active users by an estimate of events generated per user – 50 to 100 per user is a good starting point. See [Estimating usage & costs](/docs/billing/estimating-usage-costs) in our docs for more.

### Does PostHog block bots by default?

Yes. See the [full blocklist in our docs](/docs/product-analytics/troubleshooting#does-posthog-block-bots-by-default).

### What about ad blockers?

We recommend all users deploy a reverse proxy, which enables you send events to PostHog Cloud using your own domain. Events sent from your own domain and are less likely to be intercepted by tracking blockers, ensuring you capture the best data possible. 

We offer a managed reverse proxy on our Team plans, and we have [reverse proxy setup guides](/docs/advanced/proxy) for AWS Cloudfront, Caddy, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, and more, in our docs if you want to run your own.

### Can I use PostHog with a CDP? (Segment, Rudderstack, etc.)

Yes. See [Using PostHog with a CDP](/docs/advanced/cdp) in our docs.

### Can you use PostHog on e-commerce websites?

Absolutely. PostHog is easy to integrate with [Shopify](/docs/libraries/shopify) and [WooCommerce](/docs/libraries/woocommerce). You can easily install PostHog on other e-commerce platforms [using our Javascript snippet](/docs/integrate) – see our guides to [setting up Webflow analytics](/tutorials/webflow) and [Wordpress](/docs/libraries/wordpress).

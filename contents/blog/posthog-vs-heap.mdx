import ProductComparisonTable from 'components/ProductComparisonTable'

[Heap](/blog/best-heap-alternatives) is a product analytics platform known for its comprehensive autocapture – it starts collecting clicks, pageviews, and form submissions the moment you install it, no manual instrumentation required.

PostHog [also supports autocapture](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture), but goes much further – combining [product analytics](/product-analytics) with [session replay](/session-replay), [A/B testing](/experiments), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [surveys](/surveys), [error tracking](/error-tracking), and more in one developer platform.

In this guide, we break down how PostHog and Heap compare across analytics, session replay, experimentation, pricing, and compliance – so you can decide which is the better fit for your team.

## How is PostHog different?

### 1. We're built for engineers

What does this mean?

-   It means [we ship fast](/changelog) and iterate based on user feedback.
-   It means engineers do support – all product teams have a [weekly support hero](/handbook/engineering/support-hero).
-   It means we have extensive [public and private API endpoints](/docs/api), and a powerful [SQL query builder](/docs/product-analytics/sql).
-   It means we built [SDKs](/docs/libraries) for all popular (and many unpopular) client-side, backend, and mobile languages and frameworks.
-   It means we make it easy to [test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production), conduct [phased rollouts](/tutorials/phased-rollout), run [beta programs](/tutorials/public-beta-program), and so much more.

### 2. We're an all-in-one platform

Heap is mainly focused on product analytics. This means you need to adopt additional tools for things like feature management, experiments, and surveys. They're all built into PostHog – we even have a [built-in data warehouse](/data-stack) that [integrates with Stripe](/tutorials/stripe-reports) and [Hubspot](/tutorials/hubspot-reports). You can replace half a dozen tools with PostHog, save money, and get more from your data.

### 3. We're totally transparent

-   How much will PostHog cost? Use our [pricing calculator](/pricing).
-   What are we working on? It's on our [public roadmap](/roadmap)?
-   How does sales work? We have a [whole page on it](/sales).
-   What do we care about? We explain everything in our [public company handbook](/handbook).
-   How do we make money? That's [in the handbook](/handbook/how-we-make-money), too.

Oh, we're open source, too. Go take a peak at our code if you like on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/PostHog).

## Comparing PostHog and Heap

### Platform

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'heap']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics',
        'web_analytics',
        'session_replay',
        'feature_flags',
        'experiments',
        'surveys',

        'heatmaps',
        'error_tracking',
        'platform.deployment.open_source',
    ]}
/>
</p>

> 💡 **Good to know:** PostHog can replace multiple tools, such as [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar), [Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4), and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly). This makes it a lot easier to extract usable insights, since you don't have to constantly switch between tools. Running PostHog on both your product and website makes it easier to understand how marketing activity influences signups and usage, too.

### Product analytics

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'heap']}
    rows={[
        'product_analytics.pricing.free_tier',
        'product_analytics.features.autocapture',
        'product_analytics.insights.sql_editor',
        'product_analytics.insights.ai_insight_builder',
        'product_analytics.group_analytics',
        'dashboards',
        'product_analytics.trends',
        'product_analytics.funnels',
        'product_analytics.retention',
        'product_analytics.user_paths',
        'product_analytics.cohorts',
        'product_analytics.lifecycle',
        'product_analytics.stickiness',
    ]}
/>
</p>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Every PostHog user gets [1 million events for free](/pricing) each month. You can also save money by sending us anonymous events for non-identified users, which are up to 80% cheaper than identified product analytics events. Anonymous events are ideal for tracking behavior on marketing websites, or mobile apps with large consumer audiences. See our docs on [anonymous vs identified events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) for more.

### Session recordings

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'heap']}
    rows={[
        'session_replay.pricing.free_tier',
        'session_replay.platform_support.web_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.platform_support.mobile_app_recordings',
        'session_replay.identity.identity_detection',
        'session_replay.analysis.console_logs',
        'session_replay.organization.playlists',
        'session_replay.analysis.performance_monitoring',
        'session_replay.privacy.privacy_masking',
        'session_replay.targeting.conditional_recording',
        'session_replay.analysis.network_monitor',
        'session_replay.analysis.dom_explorer',
        'session_replay.export.export_to_json',
        'session_replay.export.export_to_video',

        'session_replay.targeting.target_by_sample',
        'session_replay.targeting.target_by_feature_flag',
    ]}
/>
</p>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Session replays are an essential tool for understanding how people use your product, especially for [early-stage companies](/blog/early-stage-analytics) searching for [product-market fit](/founders/product-market-fit-game). Both Heap and PostHog offer session replay, though Heap lacks many developer-facing features like a DOM explorer, performance monitoring, and network events, which are useful for fixing bugs and performance issues.

### Feature flags

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'heap']}
    rows={[
        'feature_flags.pricing.free_tier',
        'feature_flags.features.boolean_flags',
        'feature_flags.features.multivariate_flags',
        'feature_flags.features.json_payloads',
        'feature_flags.implementation.local_evaluation',
        'feature_flags.targeting.target_by_percentage',
        'feature_flags.targeting.target_by_person_properties',
        'feature_flags.management.multi_environment',
        'feature_flags.management.flag_scheduling',
        'feature_flags.implementation.bootstrapping',
        'feature_flags.features.early_access_management',
    ]}
/>
</p>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Feature flags make it easy to roll out features to specific users or groups, and [safely test in production](/product-engineers/testing-in-production). Our feature flags are also tightly integrated with other features so you can target session replays, surveys, and more using existing feature flags. See our guide on the [benefits of feature flags](/product-engineers/feature-flag-benefits-use-cases) for more.

### Experiments

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'heap']}
    rows={[
        'experiments.pricing.free_tier',
        'experiments.features.custom_goals',
        'experiments.features.secondary_metrics',
        'experiments.features.split_testing',
        'experiments.implementation.multivariate_testing',
        'experiments.analysis.statistical_significance',
        'experiments.features.recommended_run_time',
        'experiments.supported_tests.holdout_testing',
        'experiments.analysis.statistics_engine',
    ]}
/>
</p>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Our [experiments](/docs/experiments) integrate seamlessly with our [feature flag product](/docs/feature-flags). This means you can easily deploy the winning variant of an experiment with a single click from the experiment UI.

### Security and compliance

<p>
<ProductComparisonTable
    competitors={['posthog', 'heap']}
    rows={[
        'platform.security.user_privacy_options',
        'platform.security.history_audit_logs',
        'platform.security.gdpr_ready',
        'platform.security.hipaa_ready',
        'platform.security.soc2_certified',
        'platform.security.two_factor_auth',
        'platform.security.saml_sso',
    ]}
/>
</p>

> 💡**Good to know:** Additional compliance features, such as HIPAA Business Associate Agreements, advanced permissions, and audit logs are available on our some of our [platform packages](/platform-packages), which also includes our [managed reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy/managed-reverse-proxy) and white labelling for surveys and shared dashboards.

## When to choose PostHog vs Heap

Choosing the right product analytics tool depends on what your team needs beyond basic analytics. Here's a quick guide:

- Want to understand user behavior, debug issues, and ship experiments – all without switching tools? Go with **PostHog**.
- Need comprehensive autocapture with minimal engineering effort and a simple, low-density UI? **Heap** is a solid choice.

### Recommendations by team type

**For engineering-led product teams**
- **PostHog** – SQL access, public [APIs](/docs/api), [SDKs](/docs/libraries) for every major platform, and tight integration between analytics, feature flags, and experiments, error tracking, logs, LLM analytics, and more. Built by engineers, for engineers.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary>What's the main difference between PostHog and Heap?</summary>

**PostHog** is an all-in-one platform that combines [product analytics](/product-analytics), [session replay](/session-replay), [feature flags](/feature-flags), [A/B testing](/experiments), [surveys](/surveys), [error tracking](/error-tracking), [LLM analytics](/llm-analytics), and more in one environment. **Heap** focuses on product analytics and session replay, with autocapture as its core differentiator. If you need more than analytics and replay, PostHog means fewer tools and less context-switching.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Both have autocapture – what's the difference?</summary>

Both **PostHog** and **Heap** automatically capture clicks, pageviews, and form submissions. The key difference is that Heap's visual event editor lets non-technical users tag and define events retroactively without code. PostHog's autocapture works similarly but is designed more for engineering teams, with tighter integration into feature flags, experiments, and session replays.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I migrate from Heap to PostHog?</summary>

Yes. See the [Heap to PostHog migration guide](/docs/migrate/heap) for step-by-step instructions on exporting your Heap data and importing it into PostHog, including historical events and user properties.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does it take to deploy PostHog?</summary>

Minutes. Use the [onboarding wizard](/docs/ai-engineering/ai-wizard) to connect your app, or just [add the tracking snippet](/docs/getting-started) directly and autocapture starts collecting events immediately. Enable session replays, feature flags, and other features from your project settings.

<details>
<summary>Does Heap have feature flags or A/B testing?</summary>

No. **Heap** doesn't offer native feature flags or experimentation. You'd need a separate tool like LaunchDarkly or Optimizely. PostHog includes both [feature flags](/feature-flags) and [A/B testing](/experiments) natively, tightly integrated with analytics so you can measure experiment impact on funnels, retention, and revenue.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does Heap have error tracking?</summary>

No. **Heap** doesn't offer error tracking or crash monitoring. PostHog includes native [error tracking](/error-tracking) that connects exceptions and stack traces directly to session replays, user behavior, and feature flag changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which has better session replay?</summary>

Both offer session replay, but **PostHog**'s is more developer-focused. It includes console logs, network request monitoring, a DOM explorer, and performance metrics. **Heap**'s replay is simpler and more suited to PMs who want to watch user sessions without the technical detail.

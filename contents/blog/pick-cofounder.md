It's a well-worn trope at this point: a dev thinks of a product idea and bangs out a prototype in a week - but they have no clue how to sell the concept and acquire new users. Do you go it alone and try to grow the company from scratch? Or do you partner with someone who has a knack for sales and marketing and let them handle the business side of things? How much equity do you give them, and how do you pick someone you'll like but who will also pull their weight?

Technical founders struggle with these questions all the time. It can be terrifying to hand out 50% of your company's equity to a co-founder who doesn't understand the product as much as you do. Likewise, a sales-focused founder might hesitate to commit to writing code and being responsible for shipping regularly. There's a case to be made for and against getting a co-founder, and that's what we'll look at in this post.

Let's dive in.

## Do you need a co-founder?

Every technical founder struggles with this question at some point. There are many things to consider before taking the plunge, but one of these factors is your personality. If you're a lone wolf who gets stuff done faster on your own, you might want to retain complete control over the startup and simply hire someone to handle the business side of things. However, if you're a collaborator, you might find it challenging to go it alone without a peer to bounce ideas off of - and that's where a co-founder comes in.

## The case for getting a co-founder

We've recounted our story numerous times across our blog and in conversations with other founders. James has a sales background, while Tim comes from R&D. Both come with complementary skills that cover each other's weak spots, and it was fortunate that they both wanted to build this company with the same level of passion that they had and still have.

With a co-founder, you can split the load faster and bounce major decisions off a sounding board before going live. At PostHog, James is responsible for bringing in new customers (among his other CEO duties), while Tim is responsible for overseeing engineering as CTO. They both hold each other accountable, ensuring that any off-course outcomes are corrected swiftly.

Startups are hungry toddlers that demand your time, attention, money, and sanity. Having someone to lean on during challenging times - like growth declines, product failures, hiring faux-pas, etc. - greatly helps prop up your mental health and fortitude. This support is beneficial when you're bootstrapping, as you'll also need a founder who can chip in financially to keep the company afloat. Co-founder partnerships also send the right signals to wary venture capital and private equity firms, as they can trust that the company won't flame out due to an overworked founder - which makes them more likely to hand you cash.

## The case against getting a co-founder

Of course, it's not all rosy when you have a co-founder. The first thing to guard against is the unfair distribution of labor - something prevalent in product-led devtool startups where the technical founder may find themselves shouldering the bulk of the load. 

The second argument against getting a co-founder hinges on the speed, as there is now one more person to run things by before shipping or pivoting. This isn't an issue with a co-founder who's deeply aligned with you, but it can cause problems where visions diverge.

The functional-emotional gap is another red flag to watch out for. In any pairing, both founders have the emotional authority to make decisions and exert influence. Their functional authority, however, is inversely correlated to the number of skilled team members who can do their jobs better. The larger the gap between their functional and emotional authority, the greater the chances of trouble down the line.

Let me explain with an example. Suppose a dev and a salesperson get together and start a company. The technical founder has some knowledge of coding and tech infrastructure, but the company soon hires a more senior engineer who can do the job 10x better. This isn't ordinarily a bad thing - you generally want to hire people better than you to improve the product. But you also want to be able to shape, critique, and direct their work where necessary, and this is only possible if you have a solid grasp of the subject matter. The less you know about the domain, the less you can steer the team in any new direction when it comes to that subject. This problem compounds as your team expands.

## What to look for in a co-founder

There are a number of key traits and skills to look for in a co-founder. Right at the top is high EQ and communication skills. The last thing you want is a brilliant jerk riding in the cockpit with you - that's a recipe for a glorious plane crash. Find someone who understands the importance of over-communication, who can give and receive feedback, and who can be empathetic with their words, thoughts, and actions.

Both James and Tim are big on giving and receiving feedback, and that ethos is enshrined in our company handbook. While Tim prefers directness and eschews fluff, James lands feedback with a bit more empathy. Both are constantly working on their feedback mechanisms, and hosting feedback sessions tends to unearth even more ways they and the rest of the team could improve.

The second trait to look for is goal alignment. You and your founders should want to solve the same problems in the long run - whether that's to lower the cost of goods (Amazon), improve home fitness (Peloton), make photo-sharing more accessible and enjoyable (Instagram), or provide insights into what users are doing in your app (PostHog).

The third trait is enablement and empowerment - a near-obsessive desire to improve the lives of the people you work with and for. You want a co-founder who is obsessed with building the best team and product to enable users to solve their problems. 

At PostHog, our culture bears this out. Personal time off is mandated, 2 days out of each week are meeting-free, employees are empowered to spend company money like their own, we have individual bi-annual feedback sessions, and there's a focus on your career progression within the company. This in turn creates an environment where team members can come in and do their best work to create a product that users will love and continue to pay for.

The fourth trait to look for is skill alignment. There are two ways this can play out: either you both have overlapping sets of skills, or you complement each other. Overlapping skills have certain advantages: if you're both devs, you can ship stuff out faster and at a higher quality (or double your sales and marketing ROI if you're both sales-oriented). Conversely, complementary skills help you cover your respective blind spots and balance out the workload. James focuses on sales at PostHog, while Tim handles engineering.

There also needs to be symmetry between the founders in terms of effort, finances, and outlook. Co-founders need to put in a near-equal amount of effort to bring the startup to life. Furthermore, if you're bootstrapping, it's probably best to have both partners contribute an equal amount of money to the company. This lowers the power differential between the co-founders and avoids situations where one cofounder gets away with minimal work merely because they put in more money - which can lead to resentment. Lastly, all cofounders should be clear on how much they're willing to wait for the company to be profitable. If you're focused heavily on profits in the beginning because you need to pay off your mortgage or student loan, but your partner is willing to polish the product for a little longer, this can cause a massive rift between you.

## Bottom line

Having a co-founder is great - but it's far better to have no co-founder than to have the wrong one. Rot at the top infects the entire body, so keep the cockpit as clean as possible. If you do decide to get a co-founder, vet them thoroughly to increase your odds of success - here's a handy resource from First Round Review that goes in-depth into how to pick a co-founder.

Work with someone who is aligned with your vision and mission, not necessarily someone who is your best friend. Sure, you should like who you work with - and camaraderie goes a long way towards an enjoyable work environment - but a best mate who doesn't pull his weight or doesn't know his stuff will quickly frustrate you. 

Your mental health is also important, so a high EQ is crucial in your co-founder. Pick someone mature, communicative, and empathetic - not someone who will further enrich your therapist. 

As much as decision-making will be collaborative, you also need to be clear on who owns each domain. For example, James and Tim might differ on the sales or marketing approach, but James will ultimately decide which direction the company takes regarding that. Likewise, Tim is the technical guru and will decide which infrastructure would work for PostHog or which engineer would be a better fit for the company.

There's also no need to rush into a partnership - it's perfectly ok to do a trial run with a prospective co-founder before committing to them fully. This lets you see how they work, what they're like, and whether you can see yourself with them in the long run.

Crucially, have everything in writing. There are too many stories of co-founder flameouts that could've been handled much better with an ironclad contract in place. Get a lawyer to review any paperwork before you sign, and seek first to mitigate and mediate disagreements before heading to court.

Lastly, focus on building systems that eventually negate your involvement in day-to-day tasks. As co-founders, you want to be climbing higher up the priority ladder to focus on more high-level problems within the company. Document all your processes, get your team members to own their individual remits, give them the resources they need to succeed, and source regular feedback on whether the systems you've put in place are working. In the long run, recusing yourselves from the day-to-day activities of the business will be a far more effective use of your time.

What could be worse than handing out 50% of your company's equity to a co-founder who doesn't understand the product as much as you do, and all they seem to bring is the ability to talk? ;) Likewise, a sales-focused founder may be struggling to know what makes you great, or - worse - may not appreciate the importance of development. 

PostHog started when James (a commercially-minded, but bad developer) took Tim (an awesome developer) for a beer. It went pretty well after that. How come?

## Do you need a co-founder?

Tim didn't even know he wanted to start a company at this point, so the answer here was yes!

If you're a lone wolf who gets stuff done faster on your own, you might want to retain complete control over the startup and simply hire someone to handle the business side of things. This leads itself to a standard failure mode - not talking to users. You'll find it easy to build, but you'll have a hard time building something people want.

Longer term, running a company is stressful - you're creating something out of nothing, and that inherently means you'll question yourself. Perhaps the most basic thing that has worked well at PostHog is James and Tim have managed to continuously rationalize what we're doing - taking it one problem at a time. We pivoted five times in the early days, and this just wouldn't have resulted in what we are today without two people pushing each other to get over each hurdle.

##Â How do I know if this salesy cofounder is any good?

As a salesperson, watching a developer feels like magic. A whirr of terminal windows then suddenly a product makes its way into real life.

Likewise, to a developer, the instant relationship building a good salesperson has

Both of the above are _table stakes_ in either role. Do not work with a sales cofounder because they're good with people.

Skills you'll definitely need this person to have:

* Ability to get stuff done
* Product mentality
* Ability to adapt

And, crucially, you need to like working with each other.

## Isn't two devs better?

If you're comfortable talking with strangers that may often not want to talk to you, then yes this is probablty the best possible setup. One of the things that was noticeable during PostHog's time at YCombinator was how outgoing many of the technical founders were.

It has been _very_ important that James can do the basics of development. Optimally both would be kick-ass developers on top, but that has been less important than skills with external parties - there's so much selling to do with users, customers, employees and investors.

## Optimize for not breaking up

Cofounder breakup is a key way for your startup to fail.

Things PostHog did to guard against this:

* Equal equity between cofounders. Even if you didn't start on the same day. It felt like this would be an easy area for resentment to appear. Sidenote: we also are both paid the same, but it matters less to us.
* A direct culture. We give each other direct feedback. We actually mean that - we've told each other when we're getting frustrated. We've [encouraged our team](https://twitter.com/PostHogHQ/status/1385543414511542273) to do this too.
* Clear individual goals each week. It was clear that there was a ton of stuff to build in the early days, so James' job was _everything_ else - getting user meetings, wireframes, making coffee and tea, working out how to do taxes and payroll, raising money or buying food. He even did some paid consultancy to make some money to pay for some ads early on. All whilst Tim was coding. This is how we got so far so quickly.
* Both cofounders are involved in key decisions. To stereotype - salesy types tend to be more extraverted, and thus can dominate the direction. James and Tim, even with a team of 20, double up their 1/1s to 2 hours each week, to stay close.
* Work out what you both want out of life. Are you trying to retire early or is it the pure challenge? Go deep.

## Bottom line

Having a co-founder is great - but it's far better to have no co-founder than to have the wrong one.

At PostHog, we love a good old fashioned rush to get stuff done. This is _not_ an area you can get wrong - getting this right is perhaps the most crucial decision you'll take.

PostHog 1.29.0 includes a fully revamped Paths experience to better explore what actions your users are taking. Multivariate support in feature flags, private projects and DAU/WAU/MAU graphs are only a few of the new features.

## PostHog 1.29.0 release notes

> For a better experience and new features, remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog).

**Release highlights:**

- [Explore and deep dive with Paths](#explore-and-deep-dive-with-paths).
- [Multivariate support in feature flags](#multivariate-support-in-feature-flags).
- [Private projects](#private-projects).
- [Trailing DAU/WAU/MAU graphs](#trailing-dauwaumau-graphs).

### Explore and deep dive with Paths

Continuing our quest to help you understand why your users convert or don't convert, we fully revamped our Paths feature to help you explore the actions your users are taking. From jumping from a conversion drop-off in a funnel to identifying Paths ending in a desired action, you will be able to fully understand the paths of your users. We're introducing a lot of additional features such as: select up to 20 steps, fined-grained controls on what paths to show, and grouping paths through wildcards.

> üéÅ Some of these new features require a PostHog Scale or Enterprise license. [Learn more](/pricing).

### Multivariate support in feature flags

Feature flags just got a lot more powerful! Forget A/B testing, introducing A/B/C/D/... testing. You will now be able to create feature flags with multiple variants to allow for more comprehensive testing and feature releasing.

### Private projects

Extra concerns on privacy or compliance? Private projects now lets you have projects to which only certain members of your team have access. Learn more on [our docs](/docs/user-guides/organizations-and-projects#private-projects).

### Trailing DAU/WAU/MAU graphs

If you're interested in better measuring your user engagement DAU/WAU, WAU/MAU & DAU/MAU ratios can provide great signals, create graphs like this to better understand your engagement.

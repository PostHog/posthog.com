Not everyone has money to dish out for an enterprise Tableau contract, not everyone wants to send their data to Looker AKA Google either. 

Free and open source business intelligence tools solve both these problems by making BI accessible and keeping you in control of your data.

The challenge becomes choosing the best one. To help you, we've put together this list of the top free and open source business intelligence tools you can use.

## 1. PostHog

PostHog is an open source, all-in-one platform that combines business intelligence with several other developer-focused tools, such as product and web analytics, session replays, experimentation, error tracking, and surveys.

Its business intelligence stack contains three key pieces:

1. A data warehouse that stores data captured into PostHog as well as syncs with external sources you already use like Stripe, Hubspot, Postgres, Google Sheets, S3, Snowflake, and more.

2. Product analytics which provides a simple but powerful interface for building dashboards and insights like trends, funnels, retention graphs, user paths, and more. 

3. An SQL editor for direct access to your data along with its own set of visualizations and customization.

### What makes PostHog special?

PostHog has the flexibility of a business intelligence tool, while including a full suite of tools product and engineering teams need to build successful products. You have less data spaghetti trying to connect them all together. 

For example, not only can you analyze A/B tests from warehouse data in PostHog, but you can actually set up and run them natively using our experimentation and feature flag products. You don't need to set up 4 different products, just PostHog.

### FAQ

<details>
    <summary>What tools does PostHog replace?</summary>
    
    PostHog is less of a traditional replacement for tools like Looker and Tableau and more a replacement for your suite of product and data tools like [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude), [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel), [Fullstory](/blog/posthog-vs-fullstory), [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly), [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar), [Sentry](/blog/posthog-vs-sentry), and [Survicate](/blog/best-survicate-alternatives).

- [Metabase on GitHub](https://github.com/metabase/metabase)

![Metabase](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/w_1600,c_limit,q_auto,f_auto/metabase_fa7dbf71d9.png)

Metabase is an open source analytics tool that easily connects to your existing database. 

Once connected, Metabase offers an easy to use and powerful query builder. Visualizations can be built with or without SQL. Within these, users can drill down to filter, breakout, or view the source table.

Once built, Metabase then enables teams to build and organize with dashboards and collections. They also provide permissioning to ensure only the right people have access to sensitive insights.

### What makes Metabase special?

Metabase is praised for their simplicity. It really is easy to connect to a data source and start querying fast. Their visualization builder is just as simple, with a clean UI that doesn't require a power user to figure out.

### FAQ

<details>
    <summary>What tools does Metabase replace?</summary>
    
    Metabase is a simpler alternative to BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker, but it misses some of the powerful data modeling that these tools provide. It is also similar to the SQL + viz tools like Mode, Superset, and Redash.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Can it connect to my data warehouse?</summary>
    
    Metabase can connect to a bunch of popular databases including BigQuery, ClickHouse, Databricks, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Snowflake, and more.

- License: Apache 2.0
- GitHub stars: 67.9k
- [Superset on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/superset)

![Superset](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/superset_6f35a66cc9.jpg)

Apache Superset is a modern, open source exploration and visualization platform. Superset formed out of a 2015 Airbnb hackathon project.

It provides both no-code and SQL options for queries and 40+ pre-installed visualizations. In terms of “modernity”, it's lightweight, scalable, and integrates with any SQL-based database, including cloud-native and petabyte-scale ones. 

### What makes Superset special?

Superset provides a few “meta” tools for making insight creation easier.

1. A semantic layer for quickly defining custom dimensions and metrics. These abstractions map SQL to be more human-friendly.
2. Datasets which are subsets of data that make chart creation easier and queries more performant. This aims to be a middle point between a query-centric approach and a semantic-centric one.

### FAQ

<details>
    <summary>What tools does Superset replace?</summary>
    
    Like Metabase, Superset generally replaces business intelligence tools like Tableau and Power BI as well as SQL + viz tools like Mode and Metabase. On top of this, their semantic layer is a lighter version of LookML and dbt metrics.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Can it connect to my data warehouse?</summary>
    
    Superset can query data from any “SQL-speaking” datastore or data engine including Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Databricks, and more.
</details>

![Redash](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/w_1600,c_limit,q_auto,f_auto/redash_b3a8f5a223.png)

Redash is a tool that enables you to easily connect to your data sources, query them with SQL, and build dashboards for your team.

It supports a range of:

1. SQL, NoSQL, big data, and API data sources from Redshift to MySQL to Postgres.

![Lightdash](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/w_1600,c_limit,q_auto,f_auto/lightdash_63940e2642.webp)

Lightdash makes it easy to turn your dbt project into BI dashboards easily.

Once set up leveraging your existing dbt models, it makes creating visualizations easy. These don't require SQL and instead rely on their data catalog, pre-built metrics, and point and click explorer. It also includes an AI analyst co-pilot to help users self-serve their data needs. 

Although they rely on dbt, they also provide integrations for warehouses, version control tools (like GitHub), alerting (Slack), and sharing. This helps them easily connect to your existing stack. 

### What makes Lightdash special?

Lightdash has connected itself deeply to dbt. It literally markets itself as “The BI platform built for dbt.” Like Evidence, this lets teams manage everything (like dashboards) as code.

Lightdash's developer focus doesn't stop there. They also provide version controls, staging, automated testing, and CI/CD toolings. 

### FAQ

<details>
    <summary>What tools does Lightdash replace?</summary>
    
    Lightdash replaces BI tools like Looker (especially closely as their metric layer is modeled after LookML), Tableau, and Power BI. It also replaces the SQL + viz tools mentioned earlier.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Can it connect to my data warehouse?</summary>

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Is there a hosted version?</summary>
   
    Lightdash has a cloud hosted option that requires zero configuration, is updated daily, and enables unlimited users and visualizations. It starts at $800 per month with a 21-day free trial.

### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us 👋) is an open-source platform combining web and product analytics, session replay, heatmaps, A/B testing, feature flags, and user surveys into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to Adobe Analytics but also tools like [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar) and [VWO](/blog/posthog-vs-vwo).

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of October 2024, 5,330 of the top 1 million websites deploy PostHog. This is significantly more than the 3,259 who use Adobe Analytics.

#### Key features

- 📊 **Web analytics:** Monitor your [web traffic](/docs/web-analytics) by automatically capturing and calculating metrics like visitors, pageviews, session duration, and bounce rate. Easily see the sources, entry and exit paths, [channels](/docs/data/channel-type), and more.

- 📈 **Product analytics:** Visualize your data with custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- 📺 **Session replays:** See exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- 🧪 **A/B tests:** Optimize your app and website with up to nine test variations and track impact on primary and secondary metrics. Automatically calculate test duration, sample size, and statistical significance.

- 💬 **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Adobe Analytics?

PostHog has a significantly larger feature set than Adobe Analytics. It offers the event capture and visualizations of Adobe Analytics along with a suite of tools to help you understand how people use your product and measure your attempts to improve it.

> 💡 **Good to know:** Adobe Analytics has visualizations you can use for web analytics, but doesn't have a simple pre-built dashboard for you to use.

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Adobe Analytics (product analytics), [Fullstory](/blog/posthog-vs-fullstory) (session replay), and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly) (feature flags and A/B testing). This simplifies workflows and ensures product data is all in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever. Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> PostHog makes for a great all-in-one tool for tracking and improving your product. Unlike Adobe Analytics, it also has a generous free tier and is self-serve (no mandatory demo calls), so it's easy to get started. PostHog is an especially great choice for startups and scaleups.

## 4. Heap

- **Founded:** 2013
- **Similar to:** PostHog, Amplitude
- **Typical users:** Product and marketing teams
- **Typical customers:** B2C SaaS and ecommerce companies with a user experience focus.

![Heap](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/blog/best-amplitude-alternatives/heap.png)

### What is Heap?

[Heap](/blog/posthog-vs-heap) describes itself as a digital insights platform. This means it offers both product analytics and session replay and supports marketing use cases with multi-touch attribution. Contentsquare, a marketing and ecommerce analytics firm, acquired Heap in September 2023 and has been integrating it with their suite of tools.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Heap), Heap and Adobe Analytics have roughly the same number of users as of October 2024. Heap has 2,824 of the top 1 million websites, while 3,259 use Adobe Analytics.

#### Key features

- ✅ **Event autocapture:** Product teams don't need to rely on engineers to instrument all events. Heap has a visual editor for teams to tag events directly on-page for analysis.

- 📺 **Session replay:** Get qualitative insights about user behavior by replaying their session – although this lacks the debugging tools typical of most replay tools.

- 🔥 **Heatmaps:** See where people click, what point they scroll to, and the areas that get the most attention.

- 🤖 **Analysis suggestions**: Advanced data science capabilities discover hidden interactions, friction points, and knowledge about key paths.

- 🔁 **Managed ETL:** Connect to data warehouses, so you can combine your analytics with other sources and get a fuller picture of the entire user journey.

### How does Heap compare to Adobe Analytics?

Both Heap and Adobe Analytics are focused on product analytics and visualizations. Heap adds session replay, autocapture, and some platform features on top of what Adobe Analytics offers.

<ComparisonTable column1="Heap" column2="Adobe Analytics">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Self-serve" description="Free to try, no mandatory sales calls" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Web analytics" description="Pre-built dashboard of aggregate traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Product analytics" description="Custom events, trends, funnels, paths, and retention" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Autocapture" description="Capture events without manual instrumentation" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cohort analysis" description="Combine users into cohorts for analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users on your site; discover friction points" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Heatmaps" description="Visualize where users click and interact on your site" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="A/B testing" description="Run multivariate tests and see the impact of changes with custom goals and reports" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Script install" description="Start capturing data by adding a simple script to your site" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="EU hosting" description="Store your data in the EU for compliance" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Heap?

According to G2 reviews, companies enjoy these three areas of Heap:

1. **Autocapture:** Non-technical users love how easy autocapture makes tracking on their site. Along with the element data included, this provides a huge amount of useful analytics data with little setup.

2. **Simple setup:** It does not take a big technical effort to set Heap up. Users can add a single script and begin collecting data. They then make it easy to visualize that data through user paths, funnels, and session replays.

3. **Streamlining analysis:** By having analytics and session replay data in one place, Heap makes it easy to understand the usage of their app or site. This replaces interviews or user testing and makes the development cycle faster.

> #### Bottom line
> Because of its similar focus on product analytics along with autocapture and being self-serve, Heap makes for a good Adobe Analytics alternative. It still lacks the simple web analytics view that Adobe Analytics users might want.

## 5. Google Analytics

- **Founded:** 2005
- **Similar to:** Matomo
- **Typical users:** Marketing and business teams reliant on Google's ecosystem
- **Typical customers:** Small businesses and massive enterprises

![Google Analytics](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Clean_Shot_2024_10_02_at_14_54_37_25bd7082b7.png)

### What is Google Analytics?

[Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) has long been the go-to choice for website and app analytics thanks to Google's huge market share, a large amount of informational content, and its connection with the rest of the Google suite.

Google Analytics recently switched fully over from session-based Universal Analytics (GA3) to event-based GA4. This introduced conversion funnels and retention tables that some teams are fans of, but many users also miss the simplicity of session-based analytics.

Google Analytics is the most popular analytics tool. According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics), as of October 2024, a huge 489,524 of the top 1 million websites deploy Google Analytics. Adobe Analytics looks tiny in comparison with only 3,259.

#### Key features

- 📊 **Flexible reporting:** GA has pre-built insights as well as fully customizable ones to fit your reporting requirements.

- 🤖 **Predictive insights:** Alert you to trends you're not aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- 🔁 **Integration with Google tools:** It's easy to combine and analyze your GA4 data with tools like Looker Studio, Google Ads, BigQuery, and Firebase.

- ⌨️ **Natural language search:** Ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather than searching existing reports.

- 💸 **Revenue metrics:** Connect metrics to marketing spend and revenue conversion to get a full picture of ROI.

### How does Google Analytics compare to Adobe Analytics?

Adobe Analytics is Adobe's answer to Google Analytics, and this shows in terms of features. Both have become primarily tools for capturing and visualizing analytics data, but don't include the expanded feature set of other alternatives on this list.

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Google Analytics?

According to [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/google-analytics/reviews), users choose Google Analytics for:

1. **Website traffic:** The main use case reviewers praise GA for simply understanding their website's traffic, where it comes from, and what they do on the site.

2. **Connection to marketing:** Marketers like that it connects to marketing tools like Ads and Search Console. This helps them analyze the overall effectiveness of marketing efforts.

3. **AI insights:** Reviewers appreciate the fact that GA surfaces insights automatically and makes predictions. This helps them find new ways of improving their site.

> #### Bottom line
> Google Analytics is the most obvious alternative to Adobe Analytics, but it isn't necessarily the best. Although it includes the simplified web analytics dashboard, it lacks the expanded feature set modern product and engineering teams might expect.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect Adobe Analytics replacement if:

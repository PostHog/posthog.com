### New: Person properties have moved on to events

We've made substantial changes to the way [persons](/manual/persons) and [events](/manual/events) work by moving all persons properties _onto_ events. It's a substantial change, months in the planning, which is critical to PostHog's ability to scale. 

A big benefit of this approach is that it enables significantly faster queries because we no longer have to compare multiple tables when running queries - everything is stored on the event. Some of our internal tests have shown a 400x increase in speed!

This is a big change and one which we're planning to cover in more detail soon. Stay tuned to [the PostHog blog](/blog) for updates.

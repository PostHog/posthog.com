### Beta: Persons on events

We're getting ready to make a substantial change to the way [persons](/manual/persons) and [events](/manual/events) work by essentially combining them and moving all persons properties _onto_ events. 1.39.0 gives you the chance to try the feature ahead of the full release by toggling your `actors_on_events_teams` [instance setting](/docs/self-host/configure/instance-settings).

So, why have we moved person properties onto events? In part it's because it streamlines how we store data as we continue to scale, but it's also to unlock significant speed increases on queries involving both persons and events. Previously, PostHog stored personIDs and event information in separate tables, but this update simplifie

A big benefit of this approach is that it enables significantly faster queries because we no longer have to compare multiple tables when running queries - everything is stored on the event. Some of our internal tests have shown a 400x increase in speed!

We'll share more about this shift once it's fully released to all users - keep and eye on [the PostHog blog](/blog) for updates. 

### Improvement: Turbo properties

Frustrated that it was taking a few seconds to load properties? You weren't the only one. Thankfully, version 1.39.0 addresses this by adding a limit so that PostHog doesn't always search through hundreds of thousands of properties for each query. The result? [Properties load much faster](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/11037). 

Even better, this is just the starting point. We're aware that we need to do more to improve how properties work on PostHog, and we're working on it. 

### New: Format your insights as containing durations

![formatting an insight as a duration](../images/blog/array-1.39.0/duration-formatting.gif)

Do your event properties contain milliseconds or seconds? Then you can now make things easier by marking your insight as showing durations to get more readable duration formatting on your queries. It works especially well with...

### New: Big, bold number chart type

![the big bold number insight formatted as a duration](../images/blog/array-1.39.0/big-number.png)

This new, much requested and very exciting big bold number insight type does exactly what it says: simplifies a query down to a single number. Handy for those times when you need to track one big number.

### New: 

Paul to add a highlight here. Just one or two sentences is enough.

### Improved: the history log now shows changes to Insights

We've had feedback that people love seeing the activity on feature flags. So we've added it to insights too \o/

### Instrumentation improvement: 

We now automatically [comment all SQL queries generated by posthog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/10433) with tags. This helps track down performance issues on self-hosted instances.

### Apps: 

Joe will add our newest apps here.

### Other improvements & fixes
Version 1.39 also adds hundreds of other improvements and fixes, including...

-   **Improvement**: We've removed some axe violations on Home, to improve accessibility. And added accessibility testing to our workflow. Bonus: Check the PR for [a _fantastic_ Dad joke](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/11211#discussion_r941651022). 
-   **Improvement**: When deleting persons, you can now choose to delete event data as well thanks to [a new person deletion flow](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/11347).
-   **Improvement**: We've [optimised the query behind loading property definitions](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/11037). For PostHog Cloud we saw a 75% reduction in API call time.
-   **Improvement**: [We've separated the list of feature flags on an event from its event properties in the taxonomic filter](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/10668). Making it (approximately) 1,000,000% easier to find things when there are lots of feature flags.
-   **Fix**: In a few unexpected cases we used to return a successful response to some invalid API requests to the capture endpoint. [Now we correctly return a `400 BAD REQUEST`](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/10999) which will help people with useful feedback during development

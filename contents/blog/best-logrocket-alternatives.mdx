### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace LogRocket (session replay and analytics), LaunchDarkly (feature flags and A/B testing), and Hotjar (feedback and surveys). This simplifies workflows and ensures all their data is in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing). Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
>
> LogRocket focuses on helping teams fix issues with their product, while PostHog focuses on helping teams build a successful product. PostHog is a great alternative because it includes most of the features of LogRocket, with less of a focus on errors and more on A/B testing and surveys.

## Is PostHog right for you?

Here's the (short) sales pitch.

We're biased, obviously, but we think PostHog is the perfect LogRocket replacement if:

- You value transparency (we're open source and open core)
- You want tools to help you build a better product, rather than just fix issues (we added A/B testing, feature flags, surveys, and more on top of LogRocket's feature set)
- You want to try before you buy (we're self-serve with a [generous free tier](/pricing))

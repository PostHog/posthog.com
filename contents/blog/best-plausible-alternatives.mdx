### What is PostHog?

[PostHog](/) (that's us üëã) is an open-source platform combining web analytics, product analytics, session replay, A/B testing, feature flags, and user surveys into one product. This means it's not only an alternative to [Plausible](/blog/posthog-vs-plausible) but also tools like [Mixpanel](/blog/posthog-vs-mixpanel), [Hotjar](/blog/posthog-vs-hotjar), and [LaunchDarkly](/blog/posthog-vs-launchdarkly).

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/PostHog), as of October 2024, 5,330 of the top 1 million websites deploy PostHog, significantly more than the 3,500 using Plausible.

### Key features

- üìä **Web analytics:** Monitor your [web traffic](/docs/web-analytics) by automatically capturing and calculating metrics like visitors, pageviews, session duration, and bounce rate. See the sources, entry and exit paths, [channels](/docs/data/channel-type), and more.

- üìà **Product analytics:** Custom trends, funnels, user paths, retention analysis, and segment user cohorts. Also, direct [SQL querying](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for power users.

- üì∫ **Session replays:** View exactly how users are using your site. Includes event timelines, console logs, network activity, and 90-day data retention.

- üí¨ **Surveys:** Target surveys by event or user properties. Templates for [net promoter score (NPS)](/templates/nps-survey), [product-market fit (PMF)](/templates/pmf-survey) surveys, and more.

### How does PostHog compare to Plausible?

Plausible focuses on web analytics. PostHog includes web analytics but also offers a full suite of tools to help you build a better site and product. On top of this, you can use all of the features of PostHog for free forever. Plausible costs a minimum of $9/month.

</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use PostHog?

According to [reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/posthog/reviews), companies use PostHog because:

1. **It replaces multiple tools:** PostHog can replace Plausible (web analytics), [Amplitude](/blog/posthog-vs-amplitude) (product analytics), and [Fullstory](/blog/posthog-vs-fullstory) (session replay). This simplifies workflows and ensures product data is all in one place.

2. **Pricing is transparent and scalable:** Reviewers appreciate how PostHog's pricing scales as they grow. There's a [generous free tier](/pricing) they can use forever. Companies eligible for [PostHog for Startups](/startups) also get $50k in additional free credits.

3. **They need a complete picture of users:** PostHog includes every tool necessary to understand users and improve products. This means creating funnels to track conversion, watching replays to see where users get stuck, testing solutions with A/B tests, and gathering feedback with user surveys.

> #### Bottom line
> Because PostHog is free, has web analytics and more, and still has the privacy and compliance features Plausible offers, it makes for a great alternative, especially for developers and startups.

## 2. Fathom

- **Founded:** 2018
- **Similar to:** Plausible, Google Analytics
- **Typical users:** Founders and content teams
- **Typical customers:** Privacy-conscious, content-focused websites

![Fathom](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/Clean_Shot_2024_10_02_at_16_12_06_c41b89ea2f.png)

### What is Fathom?

[Fathom](/blog/best-fathom-alternatives) is a privacy-focused [Google Analytics alternative](/blog/ga4-alternatives). It is a simple web analytics tool that captures details on traffic, sessions, referrers, sources, and campaigns. It does this while helping users stay compliant and avoid cookies.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Fathom-Analytics), as of October 2024, 1,832 of the top 1 million websites deploy Fathom. This is just under half of Plausible's 3,500.

#### Key features

- üßë‚Äçüé® **Simple web analytics:** Fathom provides a simple, GA-like experience to monitor your website and get an overview of your traffic.

- üç™ **Cookieless:** Avoid cookie banners and track your site without using cookies.

- üìä **Marketing metrics:** Track the sources, devices, browsers, locations, UTMs, and more for your traffic. 

- ‚≠ê **Conversions:** Track custom events and analyze them as conversions towards a goal.

### How does Fathom compare to Plausible?

Feature-wise, Plausible and Fathom are nearly identical. Looking closer, however, Fathom is missing some of the compliance features Plausible offers, like [open source](/blog/best-open-source-analytics-tools) code.

<ComparisonTable column1="Fathom" column2="Plausible">
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Free tier" description="Free forever option, no credit card required" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Web analytics" description="Pre-built dashboard of aggregate traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Conversions" description="Track conversions towards a goal metric with funnels" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Open source" description="Audit code, contribute to roadmap, and build integrations" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="EU hosting" description="Store your data in the EU for compliance" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={true} feature="Cookieless tracking" description="Option to track without using cookies" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Product analytics" description="Create custom dashboards, trends, funnels, paths, and retention" />
  <ComparisonRow column1="Events only" column2={true} feature="Custom events" description="Manually capture custom events and properties wherever they happen" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="User profiles" description="Capture and analyze data at the user-level" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Cohort analysis" description="Combine users into cohorts for analysis" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={false} feature="Session replay" description="Watch real users on your site; discover friction points" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Reverse proxy" description="Official instructions to capture more accurate data by avoiding tracking blockers" />
</ComparisonTable>

> üí° **Good to know:** Fathom isn't entirely EU hosted, but instead attempts to stay compliant with European regulation by:
> 1. Being a Canadian company. The European Commission determined that Canada has an adequate level of data protection.
> 2. Having EU isolation so visitor data is routed and stored on EU servers.
> 3. Having a data processing agreement (DPA) available.

### Why do companies use Fathom?

Fathom has limited reviews on G2, but much more praise on social. Judging from social posts, the main reasons people choose Fathom are:

1. **Privacy-focus:** Fathom reviewers almost always praise its focus on privacy. This allows users to stay compliant with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and more.

2. **Ease of use:** Reviewers find Fathom is simple to set up and simple to understand. Less technical users find this especially helpful.

3. **Migration from GA:** Thanks to both its Google Analytics importer and its relatively similar interface, reviewers find the migration from GA to Fathom relatively easy.

> #### Bottom line
> Fathom and Plausible both provide a simple web analytics experience. Depending on your regulatory needs, it is one to consider, but it is missing some of the features users choose Plausible for.

<br />

## 3. Matomo

- **Founded:** 2007
- **Similar to:** Piwik Pro, Google Analytics
- **Typical users:** Marketing and ecommerce teams
- **Typical customers:** Privacy-focused former GA users

[Matomo](/blog/posthog-vs-matomo) is a fully-featured, privacy-focused Google Analytics alternative. It contains basic web analytics along with more advanced product and behavioral analytics features. This includes features like funnels, cohorts, session recordings, and heatmaps.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Matomo), as of October 2024, 20,816 of the top 1 million websites deploy Matomo. This is nearly seven times more than the 3,500 who use Plausible.

#### Key features

- üí∏ **Ecommerce:** Integrate with popular ecommerce platforms and track sales, products, and conversions.

### How does Matomo compare to Plausible?

Matomo is more of a like-for-like alternative to Google Analytics, meaning it has many more features than Plausible. Both are also privacy-focused, open source, and only have trials, not free tiers.

</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Matomo?

According to reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/matomo-formerly-piwik/reviews), people choose Matomo because:

1. **On-premise:** Reviews appreciate that Matomo can be hosted and run from your own servers, keeping them in full control of their data.

2. **Privacy:** Matomo is open-source, self-hostable, and community-focused. The combination of these creates a privacy-focused platform reviewers appreciate.

3. **GA-like:** Matomo's feature set is very similar to Google Analytics. This means users can do the analysis they are familiar with on a more privacy-friendly platform.

> #### Bottom line

## 4. Heap

- **Founded:** 2013
- **Similar to:** PostHog, LogRocket

### What is Heap?

[Heap](/blog/posthog-vs-heap) describes itself as a digital insights platform. This means it offers both product analytics and session replay and supports marketing use cases with multi-touch attribution. Contentsquare, a marketing and ecommerce analytics firm, [acquired Heap in September 2023](https://contentsquare.com/heap/) and announced plans to integrate the two products.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Heap), a similar number of users deploy both Heap and Plausible. As of October 2024, 2,824 of the top 1 million websites deploy Heap while 3,500 use Plausible.

- üîÅ **Managed ETL:** Connect to data warehouses, so you can combine your analytics with other sources and get a fuller picture of the entire user journey.

### How does Heap compare to Plausible?

Heap has much more of a product focus than Plausible. This means it lacks the easy-to-use web analytics features, but makes up for it with product analytics, session replay, and more. It also isn't open source or hostable in the EU.

<ComparisonTable column1="Heap" column2="Plausible">
  <ComparisonRow column1={true} column2={false} feature="Free tier" description="Free forever option, no credit card required" />
  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Web analytics" description="Pre-built dashboard of aggregate traffic, sources, campaigns, and session metrics" />

  <ComparisonRow column1={false} column2={true} feature="Reverse proxy" description="Official instructions to capture more accurate data by avoiding tracking blockers" />
</ComparisonTable>

### Why do companies use Heap?

According to G2 reviews, companies enjoy these three areas of Heap:

1. **Autocapture:** Non-technical users love how easy autocapture makes tracking on their site. Along with the element data included, this provides a huge amount of useful analytics data with little setup.

2. **Simple setup:** It does not take a big technical effort to set Heap up. Users can add a single script and begin collecting data. They then make it easy to visualize that data through user paths, funnels, and session replays.

3. **Streamlining analysis:** By having analytics and session replay data in one place, Heap makes it easy to understand the usage of their app or site. This replaces interviews or user testing and makes the development cycle faster.

> #### Bottom line
> Heap is a good alternative for teams focused on improving their product. For web or privacy-focused teams, there are likely better options.

<br />

### What is Google Analytics?

[Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) has long been the go-to choice for website and app analytics thanks to Google's huge market share, a large amount of informational content, and its connection with the rest of the Google suite.

Google Analytics recently switched fully over from session-based Universal Analytics (GA3) to event-based GA4. This also introduced conversion funnels and retention tables that product teams are fans of. 

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics), as of October 2024, a whopping 489,524 of the top 1 million websites deploy Google Analytics. Massively more than the 3,500 using Plausible.

- üîÅ **Integration with Google tools:** It's easy to combine and analyze your GA4 data with tools like Looker Studio, Google Ads, BigQuery, and Firebase.

- ‚å®Ô∏è **Natural language search:** Ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather than searching existing reports.

### How does Google Analytics compare to Plausible?

Plausible positions itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. It doesn't have as many features, but for many users, the privacy trade-off is worth it.

### Why do companies use Google Analytics?

According to [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/google-analytics/reviews), users choose Google Analytics for:

1. **Website traffic:** The main use case reviewers praise GA for simply understanding their website's traffic, where it comes from, and what they do on the site.

2. **Connection to marketing:** Marketers like that it connects to marketing tools like Ads and Search Console. This helps them analyze the overall effectiveness of marketing efforts.

3. **AI insights:** Reviewers appreciate the fact that GA surfaces insights automatically and makes predictions. This helps them find new ways of improving their site.

> #### Bottom line
> Google Analytics is the default web analytics tool for many teams. Its integrations with other Google tools make it hard to beat for users reliant on that ecosystem. For privacy-focused teams, or ones looking for an easy-to-use tool, there are better options.

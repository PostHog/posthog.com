[Plausible](/blog/posthog-vs-plausible) does simple, privacy-friendly website analytics really well. No cookies, no complex setup, no overwhelming dashboards.

But simplicity has trade-offs. Plausible doesn't offer session replay, A/B testing, or feature flags. Key features like funnels and ecommerce tracking are locked behind its Business plan. And there's no free tier – just a 30-day trial.

If you've outgrown Plausible or need more from your analytics stack, this guide compares the best alternatives – whether you want a similarly lightweight tool or a full platform for building better products.

## 1. PostHog

-   **Founded:** 2020

### What is Fathom?

[Fathom](/blog/best-fathom-alternatives) is a privacy-focused [Google Analytics alternative](/blog/ga4-alternatives). It is a simple web analytics tool that captures details on traffic, sessions, referrers, sources, and campaigns. It does this while helping users stay compliant and avoid cookies.

    ]}
/>
</p>

<details>
<summary>Main differences between Fathom and Plausible</summary>

- Plausible is open source (AGPL license) with a self-hostable Community Edition; Fathom is closed-source and cloud-only.
- Plausible is fully EU-hosted on European-owned infrastructure; Fathom is Canadian-based with EU isolation for visitor data routing.
- Plausible offers conversion funnels on its Business plan; Fathom doesn't have native funnel analysis.
- Plausible integrates with Google Search Console for SEO data in-dashboard; Fathom doesn't offer this integration.
- Fathom starts at $15/month for 100k pageviews; Plausible starts at $9/month for 10k pageviews, making it cheaper at low volumes but more expensive as traffic grows beyond 2M pageviews.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Main similarities between Fathom and Plausible</summary>

- Both are privacy-first analytics tools designed as Google Analytics alternatives.
- Both use cookieless tracking and don't require cookie consent banners.
- Both offer simple, single-page dashboards with pageviews, visitors, referrers, and sources.
- Both support custom events, UTM campaign tracking, and conversion goals.

</details>

> 💡 **Good to know:** Fathom isn't entirely EU hosted, but instead attempts to stay compliant with European regulation by:
>
> 1. Being a Canadian company. The European Commission determined that Canada has an adequate level of data protection.
> 2. Having EU isolation so visitor data is routed and stored on EU servers.
> 3. Having a data processing agreement (DPA) available.

### Why do companies use Fathom?

Fathom has limited reviews on G2, but much more praise on social. Judging from social posts, the main reasons people choose Fathom are:

1. **Privacy-focus:** Fathom reviewers almost always praise its focus on privacy. This allows users to stay compliant with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and more.

2. **Ease of use:** Reviewers find Fathom is simple to set up and simple to understand. Less technical users find this especially helpful.

> #### Bottom line
>
> Fathom and Plausible both provide a simple web analytics experience. Depending on your regulatory needs, it is one to consider, but it is missing some of the features users choose Plausible for.

-   **Similar to:** PostHog, LogRocket

[Heap](/blog/posthog-vs-heap) describes itself as a digital insights platform. This means it offers both product analytics and session replay and supports marketing use cases with multi-touch attribution. Contentsquare, a marketing and ecommerce analytics firm, [acquired Heap in September 2023](https://contentsquare.com/heap/) and announced plans to integrate the two products.

#### Key features

- **Event autocapture:** Product teams don't need to rely on engineers to instrument all events. Heap has a visual editor for teams to tag events directly on-page for analysis.

- **Session replay:** Get qualitative insights about user behavior by replaying their session - although this lacks the debugging tools typical of most replay tools.

- **Heatmaps:** See where people click, what point they scroll to, and the areas that get the most attention.

- **Managed ETL:** Connect to data warehouses, so you can combine your analytics with other sources and get a fuller picture of the entire user journey.

### How does Heap compare to Plausible?

Heap has much more of a product focus than Plausible. This means it lacks the easy-to-use web analytics features, but makes up for it with product analytics, session replay, and more. It also isn't open source or hostable in the EU.

### Why do companies use Heap?

2. **Simple setup:** It does not take a big technical effort to set Heap up. Users can add a single script and begin collecting data. They then make it easy to visualize that data through user paths, funnels, and session replays.

3. **Streamlining analysis:** By having analytics and session replay data in one place, Heap makes it easy to understand the usage of their app or site. This replaces interviews or user testing and makes the development cycle faster.

> #### Bottom line
>
> Heap is a good alternative for teams focused on improving their product. For web or privacy-focused teams, there are likely better options.

### What is Google Analytics?

[Google Analytics](/blog/posthog-vs-ga4) has long been the go-to choice for website and app analytics thanks to Google's huge market share, a large amount of informational content, and its connection with the rest of the Google suite.

Google Analytics recently switched fully over from session-based Universal Analytics (GA3) to event-based GA4. This also introduced conversion funnels and retention tables that product teams are fans of.

According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics), as of October 2024, a whopping 489,524 of the top 1 million websites deploy Google Analytics. Massively more than the 3,500 using Plausible.

#### Key features

- **Flexible reporting:** GA has pre-built insights as well as fully customizable ones to fit your reporting requirements.

- **Predictive insights:** Alert you to trends you're not aware of, like an increase in traffic to a specific landing page, or an anomalous decline in conversion from one period to another.

- **Integration with Google tools:** It's easy to combine and analyze your GA4 data with tools like Looker Studio, Google Ads, BigQuery, and Firebase.

- **Natural language search:** Ask specific questions, like "MoM growth in users on iOS", rather than searching existing reports.

- **Revenue metrics:** Connect metrics to marketing spend and revenue conversion to get a full picture of ROI.

### How does Google Analytics compare to Plausible?

Plausible positions itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics. It doesn't have as many features, but for many users, the privacy trade-off is worth it.

### Why do companies use Google Analytics?

According to [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/google-analytics/reviews), users choose Google Analytics for:

1. **Website traffic:** The main use case reviewers praise GA for simply understanding their website's traffic, where it comes from, and what they do on the site.

2. **Connection to marketing:** Marketers like that it connects to marketing tools like Ads and Search Console. This helps them analyze the overall effectiveness of marketing efforts.

3. **AI insights:** Reviewers appreciate the fact that GA surfaces insights automatically and makes predictions. This helps them find new ways of improving their site.

> #### Bottom line
>
> Google Analytics is the default web analytics tool for many teams. Its integrations with other Google tools make it hard to beat for users reliant on that ecosystem. For privacy-focused teams, or ones looking for an easy-to-use tool, there are better options.

## Which Plausible alternative should you choose?

- Need more than web analytics – like [session replay](/docs/session-replay), [A/B testing](/docs/ab-testing), [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags), and [error tracking](/docs/error-tracking)? **PostHog** goes far beyond pageviews and won't cost you a thing to start.
- Want a near-identical experience to Plausible with a free cloud tier? **Umami** is the closest match.
- Privacy-focused but need a GA-like feature set with funnels, heatmaps, and ecommerce? **Matomo** bridges the gap.
- Looking for the simplest possible dashboard with strong privacy credentials? **Fathom** keeps it minimal.
- Enterprise team needing consent management, tag management, and strict compliance? **Piwik Pro** is built for regulated environments.
- Heavily invested in Google Ads, BigQuery, and the Google ecosystem? **Google Analytics** is hard to beat for marketing attribution.

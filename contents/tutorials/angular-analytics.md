Angular is one of the original JavaScript web app frameworks and remains a popular choice for building them. To make your Angular app as good as possible, you need tools like [analytics](/docs/product-analytics), [session replay](/docs/session-replay), and [feature flags](/docs/feature-flags). PostHog provides these tools and is easy to set up in Angular.

This tutorial shows you how to set up the tools PostHog provides by creating a basic Angular app, adding PostHog, and then using it to capture events and manage feature flags.

> **Note:** This tutorial uses Angular v16. To learn how to set up PostHog for v18, see our [Angular docs](/docs/libraries/angular).

## Creating our Angular app

Angular has a powerful CLI we rely on for this tutorial. Install it by running `npm install -g @angular/cli` in your terminal.

Once installed, create a new Angular app (with routing) and go into its folder. 

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli@16 ng new angular-ph --routing
cd angular-ph
```

### Adding pages

To show the basics of PostHog, we create a simple app—just two pages and a link to move between them.

To start with creating this app, first, generate `home` and `about` components using the Angular CLI.

```bash
ng generate component home
ng generate component about
```

This creates new folders in `src/app` for each of them. Next, set up both these pages with a title and a link. First, edit `src/app/home/home.component.html` for the home page component:

```html
<h1>Home</h1>
<a routerLink="/about" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Go to About</a>
```

Next, edit `src/app/about/about.component.html` for the about page component:

```html
<h1>About</h1>
<a routerLink="/" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Back Home</a>
```

In `src/app/app-routing.module.ts`, import and add these pages as routes:

```js
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
  path: 'about',
  component: AboutComponent
  }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

Remove the placeholder code from `app.component.html`, leaving us with only the router outlet.

```bash
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

Now, we can run `ng serve` in our terminal and go to [`http://localhost:4200/`](http://localhost:4200/) to see our basic app.

## Installing PostHog

With our app set up, it’s time to install and set up PostHog. To start, install the [JavaScript web SDK](/docs/libraries/js):

```bash
npm i posthog-js
```

In `main.ts`, initialize PostHog using your project API key and instance address. You can get both in your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).  

```js
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

posthog.init(
  '<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    api_host:'<ph_client_api_host>'
  }
)

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

Once set up, go back to your app, refresh, and PostHog begins autocapturing events. This includes button clicks, pageviews, pageleaves, and more. It also starts [recording sessions](/docs/session-replay) if you enable those in [your project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

![Events](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/tutorials/angular-analytics/event.png)


## Capturing pageviews

You might notice that moving between pages only captures a single pageview event. This is because PostHog only captures pageview events when a [page load](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event) is fired. Since Angular creates a single-page app, this only happens once, and the Angular router handles subsequent page changes.

If we want to capture every route change, we must write code to capture pageviews that integrates with the router.

In `app-routing.module.ts`, import `Router`, `NavigationEnd`, and PostHog. Use these to set up a Router constructor that triggers a `$pageview` capture on `NavigationEnd` events like this:

```js
// other imports...
import { RouterModule, Routes, Router, NavigationEnd } from '@angular/router';
import posthog from 'posthog-js';

//... routes, @NgModule

export class AppRoutingModule {
  constructor(private router: Router) {
    this.router.events.subscribe(event => {
      if (event instanceof NavigationEnd) {
        posthog.capture('$pageview');
      }
    });
  }
 }
```

Now, every time a user moves between pages, PostHog captures a `$pageview` event, not just the first page load. 

Lastly, go back to `main.ts` and make sure to set `capture_pageview` in the PostHog initialization config to `false`. This turns off autocaptured pageviews and ensures you won’t double-capture pageviews on the first load.

```js
posthog.init(
  '<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    api_host:'<ph_client_api_host>',
    capture_pageview: false
  }
)
```

## Capturing custom events

Beyond pageviews, there might be more events you want to capture. To do this, you can capture custom events with PostHog. 

To showcase this, add a button to the home component that captures a `home_button_clicked` event in PostHog. To do this, go to your `home.component.html` and add the button with a click handler.

```html
<h1>Home</h1>
<button (click)="onClick()">Click me!</button>
<a routerLink="/about" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Go to About</a>
```

Afterwards, in `home.component.ts`, import PostHog and add the `onClick()` function with the `posthog.capture` call. Also, you can include a `button_name` property in the capture and use it for filtering later.

```js
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent {
  onClick() {
    posthog.capture(
      'home_button_clicked', 
      { 'button_name': 'home' }
    )
  }
}
```

When users click this button, PostHog captures a custom `home_button_clicked` event.

## Setting up and using feature flags

PostHog enables you to use feature flags to control the release of features and code. We can use one to control the text on our button.

To start, go to the [feature flags tab](https://app.posthog.com/feature_flags) in PostHog and click "New feature flag." Name your key (like `test-flag`) and set the release conditions to 100% of users. Fill in any other details as you like, and then press "Save."

![Feature flag](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1710055416/posthog.com/contents/images/tutorials/angular-analytics/flag.png)

To implement the flag in our app, we must make the following changes the `home.component.ts` file:

- Set up a change detector service by importing `ChangeDetectorRef` and using a `constructor` to initialize it.

- Add a `buttonText` state variable in our `HomeComponent` class.

- Use the `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook to wait for flags to load with `posthog.onFeatureFlags` then check our flag with `posthog.isFeatureEnabled('test-flag')`.

- Check the flag value, update the `buttonText` state, and use the `changeDetector` to update the template accordingly. 

Altogether, this looks like this:

```js
import { Component, ChangeDetectorRef } from '@angular/core';
import posthog from 'posthog-js'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.css']
})
export class HomeComponent {
  constructor(private changeDetector: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  buttonText: string = 'Click me!';

  ngOnInit() {
    posthog.onFeatureFlags(() => {
      if (posthog.isFeatureEnabled('test-flag')) {
        this.buttonText = 'This page is great!';
        this.changeDetector.detectChanges();
      }
    });
  }

  onClick() {
    posthog.capture(
      'home_button_clicked', 
      { 'button_name': 'home' }
    )
  }
}
```

Lastly, update `home.component.html` to use the `buttonText` state variable.

```html
<h1>Home</h1>
<button (click)="onClick()">{{buttonText}}</button>
<a routerLink="/about" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Go to About</a>
```

Now when you go to your app, a PostHog feature flag controls the button text.

> **Note:** If you want to remove the "flickering" of the button value on the first load, you can [bootstrap the flag values](/tutorials/bootstrap-feature-flags-react).

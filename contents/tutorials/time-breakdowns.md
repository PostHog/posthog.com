By default, PostHog provides an easy way to group events by week, day, and even hour. Sometimes, smaller, more specific breakdowns are required. With [HogQL](/docs/hogql), you can break down events by time of day, hourly, and even minute-by-minute to help you do a detailed analysis of when they happen, and this tutorial shows you how to do that.

## Time of day breakdown

We start with an easy scenario: breaking down what part of the day events take place in. To do this, we [create an insight](https://app.posthog.com/insights/new) and then break it down by checking if the event timestamp is in the morning, afternoon, evening, or night. We use a HogQL `multiIf()` [expression](/docs/hogql/expressions) using the hours of the day to check against `toHour(timestamp)` like so:

```sql
multiIf(
   5 >= toHour(timestamp) and toHour(timestamp) < 12, 'morning',
   12 >= toHour(timestamp) and toHour(timestamp) < 17, 'afternoon',
   17 >= toHour(timestamp) and toHour(timestamp) < 20, 'evening',
   'night'
)
```

You can visualize this with a total value bar chart to the sums for the date range or time series bar to see how they change day to day.

> **Note:** Event timestamps default to UTC. You need to adjust your times depending on your local time. For example, if you are in Pacific Daylight Time, subtract 7 hours from UTC timestamps to match your local time.

## Hourly breakdown

PostHog enables you to group data by hour for single-day date ranges. If you want to sum these values across ranges longer than one day, you can break it down by `toHour(timestamp)` and, once again, use a total value or time series bar chart to visualize.

## Minute-by-minute breakdown

If hourly isn’t enough for you, we can move down to by the minute. We use an [SQL insight](/docs/product-analytics/sql) for this. To make one, select the "SQL" tab when [creating an insight](https://app.posthog.com/insights/new). In this insight, we select a formatted count of `toStartOfMinute(timestamp)` where the timestamp is in the past day and order by the time (`minute`). In HogQL, this looks like this:

```sql
select 
	formatDateTime(toStartOfMinute(timestamp), '%T') AS minute, 
	count(*)
from events
where timestamp > now() - interval 1 day
group by minute 
order by minute desc
  limit 100
```

If instead, you care about which minutes have the highest count, you can order by `count(*)` instead of `minute`.

```sql
select toStartOfMinute(timestamp)as minute, count(*)
  from events
  where timestamp > now() - interval 1 day
group by minute 
order by count(*) desc
  limit 100
```

HogQL also includes functions to get events for every 5, 10, and 15 minutes. To do this, replace `toStartOfMinute` with `toStartOfFiveMinutes`, `toStartOfTenMinutes`, and `toStartOfFifteenMinutes` .

## Real time filtering

Even minute-by-minute analysis might not be good enough for some people. They want a real time understanding of their analytics. To do this in PostHog, we can filter for events within a time frame. Because it takes time to ingest events into PostHog, we recommend using a 5-30 minutes filter as "real time."

To set up one of these filters, add a filter to your series or dashboard, select HogQL, then use a `dateDiff()` comparing the timestamp to the current time like this:

```sql
dateDiff('minute', timestamp, now()) < 5
```

You can use this filter on specific insights or on an entire dashboard. As example, below we use the filter to get the number of unique sessions in the last 5 minutes:

To help you get set up faster with this, you can use our [real time dashboard template](/templates/real-time-dashboard) which has basic insights and real time filters set up for you.

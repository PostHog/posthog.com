[Product analytics](/product-analytics) enable you to gather and analyze data about how users interact with your Vue.js app. To show you how to set up analytics, in this tutorial we create a basic Vue app, add PostHog, and use it to capture pageviews and custom events.

## Creating a Vue app

To demonstrate the basics of PostHog analytics, we'll create a simple Vue 3 app with two pages and a link to navigate between them.

First, ensure [Node.js is installed](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) (version 18.0 or newer). Then install `@vue/cli` and create a new Vue app:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create vue-analytics
```

Make sure to select `[Vue 3] babel, eslint` as the Vue version.

### Adding pages

Next, create two new files `HomePage.vue` and `AboutPage.vue` in `src/components`. 

In `HomePage.vue`, add the following the code:

```vue file=components/HomePage.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <router-link to="/about">Go to About</router-link>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HomePage'
}
</script>
```

In `AboutPage.vue`, add the following the code:

```vue file=components/AboutPage.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <router-link to="/">Back Home</router-link>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'AboutPage'
}
</script>
```

Next we set up the routing. First install Vue Router in your project:

```bash
npm install vue-router@4
```

In your `src` directory, create a new folder `router` and then a new file `index.js`:

```bash
cd ./src
mkdir router
cd router 
touch index.js
```

In `router/index.js`, import the components and define the routes:

```js file=router/index.js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import HomePage from '../components/HomePage.vue'
import AboutPage from '../components/AboutPage.vue'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'HomePage',
    component: HomePage
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'AboutPage',
    component: AboutPage
  }
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes
})

export default router
```

Then, update your `App.vue` to use the router-view. Replace the contents of this file with:

```vue file=App.vue
<template>
  <router-view></router-view>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App'
}
</script>
```

Finally, set up `main.js` to use the router:

```js file=main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

createApp(App).use(router).mount('#app')
```

The basic setup is now complete. Run `npm run serve` to see your app.

## Adding PostHog

> This tutorial shows how to integrate PostHog with `Vue 3`. If you're using `Vue 2`, see [our Vue docs](/docs/libraries/vue-js) for how to integrate PostHog.

With our app set up, it’s time to install and set up PostHog. If you don't have a PostHog instance, you can [sign up for free](https://us.posthog.com/signup). 

First, install `posthog-js`:

```bash
npm install posthog-js
```

Create a new [plugin](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/plugins) by creating a new folder in your base directory called `plugins` and then a new file `posthog.js`:

```bash
mkdir plugins
cd plugins 
touch posthog.js
```

In `posthog.js`, initialize PostHog with your project API key and host. You can find these in your [project settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/settings). Also, make sure to set `capture_pageview` to `history_change` because Vue acts as a single-page app and doesn't fire the page load events PostHog usually relies to capture pageviews.

```js file=plugins/posthog.js
import posthog from "posthog-js";

export default {
  install(app) {
    app.config.globalProperties.$posthog = posthog.init(
      "<ph_project_api_key>",
      {
        api_host: "<ph_client_api_host>",
        capture_pageview: 'history_change',
      }
    );
  },
};
```

Finally, activate your plugin in `main.js`:

```js file=main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'
import posthogPlugin from '../plugins/posthog';

createApp(App)
.use(posthogPlugin)
.use(router)
.mount('#app');
```

Once you’ve done this, reload your app and click the buttons a few times. You should see events and pageviews appearing in the [activity explorer](https://us.posthog.com/activity/explore).

## Capturing custom events

Beyond pageviews, there might be more events you want to capture. To do this, you can capture custom events with PostHog. 

To showcase this, update the code in `HomePage.vue` with a button and `captureCustomEvent` method that uses PostHog to capture a `home_button_clicked` event:

```vue file=HomePage.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <router-link to="/about">Go to About</router-link>
    <button @click="captureCustomEvent">Click Me</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'HomePage',
  methods: {
    captureCustomEvent() {
      this.$posthog.capture('home_button_clicked', {
        'user_name': 'Max the Hedgehog' 
      });
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Now when you click the button, PostHog captures the custom `home_button_clicked` event. Notice that we also added a property `user_name` to the event. This is helpful for filtering events in PostHog.

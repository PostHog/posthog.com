**tl;dr** Use [Actions](/docs/data/actions). Start capturing events with the new name, and then create an Action to group it with the existing event.

## Capturing events

Once your PostHog account is up and running, you'll start capturing events. Some events are [autocaptured](/docs/product-analytics/autocapture). And you can also [capture custom events](/docs/product-analytics/capture-events).

You can find all your events in the [Data management](/data-management/actions) tab in the left navigation.

But once an event is captured, there is no option to rename it!

## Grouping with actions

The solution is to start sending events with the new name, and then create an Action. Actions are a way of combining several related events into one. You can match both the old and new event name and get a fluent transition in your insights, without losing historical data.

Start by clicking the "New action" button in the [Actions](/data-management/actions) tab in Data management. Then, select the "from event or pageview" option.

For example, you can rename your sign up call to action button text from "Try for Free" to "Pricing + Signup". And those would create two separate events. But you can use Match groups to find both of those events and see them as one "Clicked Sign Up CTA" action.

## Seeing the results

You can check the Matching events section at the bottom of the Action page to verify that it's matching both of the events.

Lastly, you can create an [Insight](/docs/product-analytics/insights) with an Action just like you would do with a single event.

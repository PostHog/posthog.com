**tl;dr** Use [actions](/docs/data/actions). Start capturing events with the new name, and then create an action to group it with the existing event.

## Managing events

After you've started capturing events, you can find them in the [data management](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/actions) tab in the left navigation.

For example, you might have an existing event named `register_button_clicked` and you want to rename it to `signup_button_clicked`.

But once an event is logged, there is no option to rename it!

## How to create an action

Actions are a way of combining several related events into one. You can match both the old and new event name and get a smooth transition in your insights, without losing historical data.

Start by clicking the "New action" button in the [actions](https://us.posthog.com/data-management/actions) tab in data management. Then, select the "from event or pageview" option.

Now you can take the two separate events (`register_button_clicked` and `signup_button_clicked`) and combine them. Match groups allow you to find both of those events and see them as one "Sign Up CTA Clicked" action.

For this example, you can create two match groups and find the events by name using the "Other events" option.

## Seeing the results

After you click the "Save" button, check the matching events section at the bottom of the page to verify it's matching both events.

Lastly, you can create an [insight](/docs/product-analytics/insights) with an action just like you would do with a single event.

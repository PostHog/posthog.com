Electron enables you to easily create cross-platform desktop apps. Knowing how users are using those apps is the job of analytics, which PostHog makes easy.

This tutorial shows you how to create a basic Electron app and then set up PostHog for analytics, session replay, and the rest of PostHog's suite of dev tools.

## Creating our Electron app

To start, create a new directory for our app (we'll name ours `posthog-electron-tutorial`) and initialize an npm package. Choose the defaults for all the options except **entry point**, which you should set to `main.js`.

```bash
mkdir posthog-electron-tutorial && cd posthog-electron-tutorial
npm init
```

After initializing npm, install `electron` as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install electron --save-dev
```

We then add `electron .` as a start script.

```json
{
  "name": "posthog-electron-tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "electron": "^34.0.2"
  }
}
```

Next, we create our `main.js` file. This creates our browser window and loads an `index.html` file we'll create after.

```js
// main.js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const createWindow = () => {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
  })

  win.loadFile('index.html')
}

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  createWindow()

  app.on('activate', () => {
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
      createWindow()
    }
  })
})

app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit()
  }
})
```

We then create the `index.html` file. This will simply have a title and a button to press.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>PostHog Electron tutorial</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the PostHog Electron demo</h1>
    <button id="homeButton">Click me!</button>
    
  </body>
</html>
```

Once done, we can run `npm run start` in the terminal to see our basic app in action

## Setting up PostHog

Start by installing the `posthog-js` package:

```bash
npm i posthog-js
```

Next, create a new `renderer.js` file to import and initialize PostHog with our project API key and host (which you can get in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project)). Importantly, because Electron has security restrictions about loading external code, we need to import PostHog's full bundle. This means our Electron initialization look like this:

```js
// renderer.js
import posthog from './node_modules/posthog-js/dist/module.full.no-external.js'

posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", {
  api_host: "<ph_client_api_host>"
})
```

We then need to add this module to our `index.html` file:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>PostHog Electron tutorial</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the PostHog Electron demo</h1>
    <button id="homeButton">Click me!</button>
    
    <script type="module" src="renderer.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Once done, we can run `npm run start` again, click the button, and we'll see events autocaptured into PostHog.

[Session replay](/docs/session-replay) also works out of the box for Electron apps as long as you enable **record user sessions** in [your project settings](https://us.posthog.com/settings/project-replay).

## Capturing custom events

Although PostHog autocaptures many events like button clicks and inputs, you can also use it to capture custom events.

For example, if we wanted to capture a `home_button_clicked` event, we can simply add an event listener to `renderer.js` and then use the `capture()` method like this:

```js
// renderer.js
import posthog from './node_modules/posthog-js/dist/module.full.no-external.js'

posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", {
  api_host: "<ph_client_api_host>"
})

document.getElementById('homeButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  posthog.capture('home_button_clicked')
})
```

Because Electron apps don't have pages, you also need to do this to capture `$pageview` events however you set up navigation.

Other features of PostHog, like feature flags, experiments, group analytics, and more can all be used through the `posthog` object. See our [JavaScript Web docs](/docs/libraries/js/features) for more details.

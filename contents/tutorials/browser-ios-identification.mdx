If you use PostHog on both web and iOS apps, you can track user activity across them. When a user is authenticated on both web and mobile, their events are automatically associated by identifying them through the same account. We cover identifying users in-depth in the [identifying users documentation](/docs/product-analytics/identify).

If a user is not authenticated on web or mobile, you can't identify the user by their account. 
Instead, you can track web to mobile flows using deeplinks. 

This is useful for use cases like:

- Tracking unauthenticated users across web and mobile.

- Identifying users on pre-authentication screens like onboarding and landing pages.

- Marketing campaign attribution from an unauthenticated website to an authenticated mobile app.

## Understanding cross-platform tracking

When a user is authenticated on both web and mobile, their events are automatically linked because they are identified by a shared `distinct_id` associated with their account. This is why we recommend [calling `posthog.identify`](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/identify#1-call-identify-as-soon-as-youre-able-to) on both web and mobile as soon as the user signs up or logs in.

When a user is not authenticated, you can't call `posthog.identify`. Instead, PostHog tracks [anonymous events](/docs/data/anonymous-vs-identified-events) using a **randomly generated** `distinct_id` that contains no identifiable information.

To associate anonymous events from web to mobile, you can use deeplinks:
1. Get a distinct ID from the web app using `posthog.get_distinct_id`
2. Attach the distinct ID and other properties like UTM parameters to the deeplink
3. When the user opens the mobile app, call `posthog.identify` or `posthog.alias` with the distinct ID and other properties

Let's go through an example with Next.js and SwiftUI. These principles apply to any other web and mobile app.

## 1. Get a distinct ID from the web app

On your Next.js app, you can get the distinct ID using `posthog.get_distinct_id`. This will work for both authenticated and anonymous users.

For Next.js you should call `posthog.get_distinct_id` in `useEffect` to ensure it's called after PostHog is initialized and right after the page is loaded.

```tsx focusOnLines=6-8
'use client'
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function Home() {
  const [distinctId, setDistinctId] = useState<string | null>(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    setDistinctId(posthog.get_distinct_id()) // HIGHLIGHT
  }, [])
  return (
    <div style={{ minHeight: "100vh", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      {/* You can add other properties to the deeplink like UTM parameters */}
      <a href={`your-super-cool-mobile-app://launch?distinct_id=${distinctId}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Go to Next.js
      </a>
      <p>Distinct ID: {distinctId}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 2. Create a deeplink with the distinct ID

Using the distinct ID, you can create a deeplink that will take the user to the mobile app when the user clicks on it. You should attach other properties to the deeplink like UTM parameters to track attribution.

```tsx focusOnLines=10-17
'use client'
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function Home() {
  const [distinctId, setDistinctId] = useState<string | null>(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    setDistinctId(posthog.get_distinct_id())
  }, [])
  return (
    <div style={{ minHeight: "100vh", display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      {/* You can add other properties to the deeplink like UTM parameters */}
      <a href={`your-super-cool-mobile-app://launch?distinct_id=${distinctId}`} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> // HIGHLIGHT
        Go to Next.js
      </a>
      <p>Distinct ID: {distinctId}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3. Handle the deeplink in the mobile app

You need to configure your mobile app to handle the deeplink, you can follow the [support universal links documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content/#Support-universal-links) from Apple. Then, in your mobile app, you have two situations to handle:

1. The user is not authenticated on the mobile app
2. The user is already authenticated on the mobile app

Below is a SwiftUI example of how to handle the deeplink in the mobile app. The `DeeplinkHandler` is called from `onOpenURL` in the `App` struct.

### 3.1. The user is not authenticated on the mobile app

If the user is not authenticated on the mobile app, you can call `posthog.identify` directly with the distinct ID and other properties like UTM parameters. 

- If the web app is also unidentified, this will create a person in PostHog that links the web and mobile events.
- If the web app is identified, this will create a person in PostHog that links the web and mobile events.

```swift focusOnLines=13-17
class DeeplinkHandler: ObservableObject {
  func handleDeeplink(_ url: URL) {

    guard let components = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false),
      let queryItems = components.queryItems else {
      print("❌ No query parameters found")
      return
    }

    if let distinctIdItem = queryItems.first(where: { $0.name == "distinct_id" }),
      let distinctId = distinctIdItem.value {
      print("✅ Found distinct_id: \(distinctId)")
      
      if (authenticated()) {
        PostHogSDK.shared.alias(distinctId)
      } else {
        PostHogSDK.shared.identify(distinctId, userProperties: [] ) // HIGHLIGHT
      }
    } else {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.2 The user is authenticated on the mobile app

If the user is already authenticated on the mobile app, you can call `posthog.alias` with the distinct ID **passed in the deeplink**. Assuming you've already identified the authenticated user on the mobile app, this will attach the distinct ID to the existing person in PostHog.

```swift focusOnLines=13-17
class DeeplinkHandler: ObservableObject {
  func handleDeeplink(_ url: URL) {

    guard let components = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false),
      let queryItems = components.queryItems else {
      print("❌ No query parameters found")
      return
    }

    if let distinctIdItem = queryItems.first(where: { $0.name == "distinct_id" }),
      let distinctId = distinctIdItem.value {
      print("✅ Found distinct_id: \(distinctId)")
      
      if (authenticated()) {
        PostHogSDK.shared.alias(distinctId) // HIGHLIGHT
      } else {
        PostHogSDK.shared.identify(distinctId, userProperties: [] )
      }
    } else {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

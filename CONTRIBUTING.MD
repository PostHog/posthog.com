Welcome!

Anyone is free to suggest changes to PostHog's documentation, handbook or website 

There is a useful guide on [updating our docs](STYLEGUIDE.md).

## Creating a Pull Request

Just create a new Pull Request if you want to make an update.

For now, please request James _james@posthog.com_ to do the QA.

If you want to speak to us before doing lots of work, just email _hey@posthog.com_ - we're very responsive and friendly.

## Issues

Spotted a typo? Not got time or unsure how to fix it yourself? Raise an issue so we can spot it!

…or pick up and fix an issue if you want to do a Pull Request.

## New Content

Would you like to see us add something new to our docs/handbook or website?

Raise an issue and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea. 

Note: Please give us as much context as possible regarding why the enhancement is needed.

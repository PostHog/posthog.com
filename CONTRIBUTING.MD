Anyone is free to suggest changes to PostHog's documentation, handbook or website

There is a useful guide on [updating our docs](https://posthog.com/docs/updating-documentation). Be sure to check out the [Documentation Style Guide](STYLEGUIDE.md).

## Creating a Pull Request

Just create a new Pull Request if you want to make an update.

You can ask [Yakko](https://github.com/yakkomajuri) for a review!

If you'd like any guidance before starting work on your PR, you can reach us on [Slack](https://posthog.com/slack) - we're very responsive and friendly.

## Issues

Spotted a typo and don't have time to fix it yourself? Raise an issue so we can fix it! 

Otherwise, feel free to add a comment on our open issues indicating that you'd like to submit a PR to fix it.

## New Content

Would you like to see us add something new to our docs/handbook or website?

Raise an issue and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea.

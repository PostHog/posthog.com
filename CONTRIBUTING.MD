# Welcome!

Anyone is free to suggest changes to PostHog's documentation, handbook or website

There is a useful guide on [updating our docs](STYLEGUIDE.md).

## Creating a Pull Request

Just create a new Pull Request if you want to make an update.

For now, please request James _james@posthog.com_ to do the QA. <!-- Is the intention here to tell contributors that any PR should have James tagged in a mention or some specific type of PR? -->

If you'd like to do lots of work and want to speak to us before doing so, just email _hey@posthog.com_ - we're very responsive and friendly.

## Issues

Spotted a typo? Not got time  or unsure how to fix it yourself? Raise an issue so we can spot it! <!-- Is "Not got time" supposed to be grammatically incorrect on purpose? -->

â€¦or pick up and fix an issue if you want to do a Pull Request. <!-- What is meant by "pick up and fix an issue"? Is it trying to say, "take the initiative by picking an issue to fix, fix it, and then do a PR"? -->

## New Content

Would you like to see us add something new to our docs/handbook or website?

Raise an issue and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea.

Note: Please give us as much context as possible regarding why the enhancement is needed.

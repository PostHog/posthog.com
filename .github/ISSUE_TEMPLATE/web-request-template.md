> **Guidelines for good web requests:**
> - Avoid being overly prescriptive about design. Give inspiration, not orders.
> - Provide context about what you're trying to convey – i.e. a feeling, reaction, or narrative.
> - Draft content fully. This helps the website team have the best possible context.
> - Leave reasonable time. A week is the minimum. Two weeks notice is ideal.
> - Assign and tag Cory and Eli. They'll sort it out between them. 
> - If your request is genuinely urgent, please share in #posthogdotcom channel and mention Cory.

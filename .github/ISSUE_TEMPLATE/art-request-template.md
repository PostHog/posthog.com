> **Guidelines for good art requests:**
> - Avoid being overly prescriptive about what you need where possible. You're not prompting an AI. 
> - Provide context about what you're trying to convey â€“ i.e. a feeling, reaction, or narrative.
> - If it's for an article, share the draft headline and some bullet points of what it's about.
> - Leave reasonable time. A week is the minimum. Two weeks notice is ideal.
> - Assign / tag Lottie, so she knows about it + and at your issue to the Art & Branding project board.
> - If your request is genuinely urgent, please share in #website-and-vibes channel and mention Lottie.

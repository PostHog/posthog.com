> **How art requests work**
> By default, Lottie, Heidi & Daniel should be assigned to all art requests and the request will be added to [the art project board](https://github.com/orgs/PostHog/projects/65). They will decide who will work on this brief and reassign as needed. You can check the project board for updates if needed. 
>
> If your request is genuinely urgent, please share in [#team-marketing channel](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C08CG24E3SR) and mention Lottie, Heidi, Daniel, and/or Cory.

## Outline
_Avoid being overly prescriptive and instead provide context about what you're trying to convey - i.e. a feeling, reaction, or narrative._
_If it's for an article, share the draft headline and some bullet points of what it's about._

## Deadline & Priority
_Leave reasonable time. A week is the minimum. Two weeks notice is good, even more time is ideal._

## Technical requirements
_Dimensions, file type etc._

## Additional comments
_Comments but... additional, you know?_

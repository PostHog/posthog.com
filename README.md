This is the repository for the PostHog website. It contains:

- All of our written content and visuals including product features, manuals, docs, blogs, case studies, tutorials, and the handbook
- Features like questions and answers (using [Squeak!](https://github.com/PostHog/squeak)), job listings (using [Ashby](https://www.ashbyhq.com/customers/posthog-customer-story)), pricing calculator, roadmap, API docs, and more
- All the components, templates, logic, and styling to make this work, look pretty, and spark joy

## Quick start

1. **Pre-installation**

    Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).
    ```bash
    npm install --global yarn
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Clone the repo then navigate into your new site’s directory, install the site dependencies, and start it up.

    ```bash
    cd posthog.com/
    yarn
    yarn start
    ```

    > **Tip:** Seeing a discrepancy between local development and staging/production? Preview the production build locally by running `gatsby build && gatsby serve`

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8001`!
    
    > **Note:** You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8001/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

See full instructions on [developing PostHog.com locally in our manual](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/posthog-com/developing-the-website).

## Advanced setup

### Docker

It is also possible to use Docker to run posthog.com locally with this command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -w /app -v "$PWD":/app \
    -p 8000-8001:8000-8001 \
    -e INTERNAL_STATUS_PORT=8001 \
    node:14-slim \
    sh -c 'yarn && yarn start'
```

### Debugging errors on start
1. Pull the latest changes from `master`
2. Run `gatsby clean && yarn start` or delete `node_modules` and `.cache`
3. Check builds are passing in [deployment to Vercel](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/deployments)

### Working on `/docs/api`?

1. Create a [personal API key](https://posthog.com/docs/api#how-to-obtain-a-personal-api-key) in PostHog
1. `export POSTHOG_APP_API_KEY=key`
1. `yarn start`

### Want Ashby job listings or GitHub contributors to load?

You’ll need to set environment variables for these. [See (private) instructions](https://github.com/PostHog/company-internal/blob/master/website-api-keys.md) for this.

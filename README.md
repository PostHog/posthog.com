# PostHog.com - Docs, Website, and Handbook

This is the repository for the PostHog website, which includes our Docs and Handbook.

Please feel free to suggest any changes. See our [contributing guide](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD) for more information.

## Quick Start

1. **Pre-Installation**

    Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). GatsbyJS needs to be installed globally (see command below).
    ```bash
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Start Developing**

    Clone the repo then navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```bash
    cd posthog.com/
    yarn install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the Source Code and Start Editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

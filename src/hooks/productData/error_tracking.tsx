            "<strong>Presenter notes:</strong> Error tracking lets you monitor, investigate, and resolve any issues your users encounter within your app ‚Äì so you can ship with confidence and debug faster. It's uniquely connected to PostHog's customer infrastructure products. <em>Watch session replays</em> to see exactly what happened. <em>Create product analytics</em> to discover how  errors are impacting trends, funnels, or retention. <em>Use feature flags</em> to roll back instantly and target affected users.",
        customers: `Zealot switched from BugSnag and Amplitude. SquadS Ventures ditched three separate tools and consolidated everything into one platform.

It's all about getting all the context they need in one place, reducing the friction of debugging and fixing errors faster than their legacy workflows. 
            <br /> <br />

            "In case we haven't driven the point home by now, here's a slide all about it: PostHog Error Tracking is connected to all other PostHog products. It makes it faster to debug because you can see the full event log of what happened leading up to an error. You can watch a session recording to visualize it. You can see which feature flags were enabled at the time. And if you need to run a complex query, use the SQL editor or write a query directly from the PostHog Data Warehouse.",

            "<strong>Alerts:</strong> Get notified via email, Slack, or webhooks when new errors appear. Set custom thresholds. You don't have to wait for a spike in support tickets to know what issues users are facing. (This is also important because only a fraction of them are motivated enough to actually message you!)<br /><br /><strong>Triage:</strong> Assign errors to people or teams. Track status. Know who's fixing what. Basic but essential.<br /><br /><strong>Organize and prioritize:</strong> Merge similar errors, sort by frequency or recency, search by error message.<br /><br /><strong>Stack traces:</strong> Full stack traces with source maps. See exactly where errors happen. Works with all major frameworks. Even when minified.<br /><br /><strong>And then there's the convergence:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Session Replay:</strong> Watch the user's session leading up to the error. No more \"can't reproduce\" tickets.<br /><br /><strong>Product Analytics:</strong> Graph error rates over time. Break down by user properties. Find patterns.<br /><br /><strong>Feature Flags:</strong> Error in production? Turn off the feature instantly. Test fixes on small groups first.<br /><br /><strong>User Profiles:</strong> See all errors for a specific user in their dedicated activity timeline. Check their feature flags at error time.",

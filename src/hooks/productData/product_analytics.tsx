            "<strong>Presenter notes:</strong> Product analytics tells you what's happening in your product. PostHog is different than others because every product we build is natively integrated. This means you can jump from a graph to a session recording to visually see why something happened. Plus we use autocapture, which tracks every click and pageview automatically. No more realizing you forgot to track something important – you can define events retroactively (we call these 'actions').",
        customers:
            "Y Combinator gets 30% more data than they did with Google Analytics using a reverse proxy. Hasura found drop-offs they'd never seen before and fixed them. Contra watched recordings of users who dropped off and increased registrations by 30%. When you can understand the 'why' behind the numbers, fixing things gets a lot easier.",

            "<strong>Funnels:</strong> Shows where users drop off. What's different: correlation analysis finds what makes users convert. Jump directly from any funnel step to watch those exact users' session recordings.<br /><br /><strong>Graph & trends:</strong> Your standard line charts plus formula mode for things like DAU/MAU. Break down by any property. Built-in sampling for when you have billions of events.<br /><br /><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> See who's new, returning, dormant, or coming back. Tells you if you're churning users as fast as you're getting them. Click any segment to dig deeper.<br /><br /><strong>User Paths:</strong> See the actual routes users take. Start anywhere, end anywhere. Use wildcards to group similar pages. Great for finding unexpected user behavior.<br /><br /><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Automatically finds what successful users do differently. We've seen teams discover random actions that triple conversion rates.<br /><br /><strong>Retention:</strong> Define what 'return' means for your product. Compare cohorts. Click any data point to see the actual users. Way more flexible than standard retention charts.<br /><br /><strong>Stickiness:</strong> How often users do key actions. Different from retention - this is about depth, not just coming back. Helps you find power users.<br /><br /><strong>Powerful tools & features:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Dashboards:</strong> Unlimited. Real-time. Share publicly or embed. Subscribe via email/Slack.<br /><br /><strong>SQL:</strong> Write queries against your data. No separate data warehouse needed – though it works with yours if you have one, or you can <a href='/data-warehouse'>use ours</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Autocapture:</strong> Tracks everything automatically. Add custom events when you need them.<br /><br /><strong>Privacy controls:</strong> Mask sensitive data. Block internal users. EU data residency available.<br /><br /><strong>Group analytics:</strong> Track companies, not just users. See how all seat activity rolls up to the entire account level – essential for B2B.",

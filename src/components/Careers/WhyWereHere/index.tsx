                                    Until now, tools for building products have been fragmented. Product analytics,
                                    heatmaps, session recording and A/B testing all provide immense value, but existing
                                    tools werenâ€™t natively built to work together.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    PostHog is different by offering these tools (and more) in a single platform that
                                    you can host yourself.
                                </p>

                                    We started PostHog as part of Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful
                                    B2B software launch on Hacker News since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks
                                    old.

                                    We're proudly backed by some of the world's top investors and believe in product-led
                                    growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather
                                    than an outbound sales team and regular cold calls.

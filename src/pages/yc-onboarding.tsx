        <p>
            Welcome to our super secret YC onboarding page! We're very happy to see you. Please book in a call with us
            using the form below. If you simply can't find a time that suits you (maybe you're in Perth?), then feel
            free to email us at <i>yc@posthog.com</i> and we'll be happy to find a time that works.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The setup calls take place in small groups with Cameron from our Customer Success team, and run for about an
            hour. Before the call, we recommend you <a href="https://app.posthog.com/">sign up to our Cloud version</a>{' '}
            and try your hand at
            <Link to="/docs/integrate"> installing our snippet</Link> on your website. Doing so would allow us to tailor
            the onboarding to your needs, leveraging data from your own website instead of demo data. However, if you
            prefer to get a demo first, we'll give you access to a demo playground during our call.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Following the demo, we'll send over to you your choice of either Apple AirPods or a Timbuk2 backpack. Due to
            boring customs reasons, if you live outside the US or Canada, we'll offer you a $150 merch gift card or make
            a $150 Open Collective donation of your choice. We'll also upgrade your Cloud account to our YC Deal - a
            super generous 20m events _and_ 50k session recordings per month absolutely free for your first year.
        </p>

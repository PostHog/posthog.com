                            industry-standard confidentiality obligations, hire an independent third party auditor to
                            audit the Customer Records only to verify the amounts payable under this Agreement. If an
                            audit reveals underpayment, then Customer shall promptly pay the deficiency to PostHog plus
                            late fees pursuant to Section 5.2. PostHog shall bear the cost of an audit unless the audit
                            reveals underpayment by more than 5% for the audited period, in which case Customer shall
                            promptly pay PostHog for the reasonable costs of the audit.

                            Information, (ii) to give access to such Proprietary Information solely to those employees
                            with a need to have access thereto for purposes of this Agreement, and (iii) to take the
                            same security precautions to protect against disclosure or unauthorized use of such
                            Proprietary Information that the party takes with its own proprietary information, but in no
                            event will a party apply less than reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary
                            Information.&nbsp;

                            the public without any action by, or involvement of, the Receiving Party, or (b) was in its
                            possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully
                            disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was independently developed
                            without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party.&nbsp;

                        <p>
                            Nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Proprietary
                            Information pursuant to any judicial or governmental order, provided that the Receiving
                            Party gives the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice of such disclosure to contest such
                            order. In any event, PostHog may collect data with respect to and report on the aggregate
                            response rate and other aggregate measures of the Licensed Materials’ performance and
                            Customer’s usage of the Licensed Materials; provided that PostHog will not identify Customer
                            as the source of any such data without Customer’s prior written consent. For the avoidance
                            of doubt, use of a third party to host the data collected shall not be deemed a disclosure.

                            both agree that if anybody official, like a judge or the government, asks to see anything
                            you want kept secret, that we let the other person know before we share.&nbsp;

                            the Agreement terms is approved in writing by both Parties prior to such disclosure, or is
                            included in a filing required to be made by a party with a governmental authority (provided

                            notice to Customer (which may be sent by email). If Customer believes that PostHog has
                            billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact PostHog no later than 60 days after the
                            closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order
                            to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to Company’s customer

                            any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, GST, use or withholding taxes,
                            assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever in relation to your purchases under this Agreement
                            (collectively, the “Taxes”). You are solely responsible for paying all Taxes associated with
                            your purchases hereunder. If we have a legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which
                            you are responsible for under this Clause 4.3, we shall invoice you and you shall pay that
                            amount to us unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the
                            appropriate taxing authority. We shall calculate applicable Taxes based on your billing
                            address as detailed on the relevant Order Form or Quote (it is your duty to inform us if
                            Taxes should be assessed on a different address). You shall promptly notify us of any
                            changes to any of your addresses specified in an Order Form or Quote. Taxes shall not be
                            deducted from or set-off against the fees in the applicable Order Form or Quote.

                            perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) it will not knowingly include, in any PostHog
                            software released to the public and provided to Customer hereunder, any computer code or
                            other computer instructions, devices or techniques, including without limitation those known

                            security or user data. If, at any time, PostHog fails to comply with the warranty in this

                            noncompliance or provide Customer with a plan for correcting the noncompliance. If the

                            resulting from a cause over which it does not have direct control. This Agreement will be
                            governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. without regard to its conflict of
                            laws provisions. The federal and state courts sitting in San Francisco County, California,
                            U.S.A. will have proper and exclusive jurisdiction and venue with respect to any disputes

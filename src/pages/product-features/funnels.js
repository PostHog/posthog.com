                            PostHog funnels offer you a visual representation of the flow of users through specific
                            areas of your app, such as the sign up process. They allow you to understand what percentage
                            of users go from one step to another, so you can identify any areas for improvement in
                            multi-step processes.

                        <hr className="redLine" />
                        <p>
                            Funnels are especially useful for understanding at which step of a process users are
                            dropping off. They can help you identify points that need attention in order to improve
                            conversion rates, or simply make the app more friendly to use.

                            In PostHog, you can see an aggregate view of all your users going through a funnel, filter
                            them by a certain property, or even see each user individually! This makes it easy to
                            identify accessibility issues, or areas where information might be unclear. With funnels,
                            you can identify patterns, polish the UX, and improve conversion.

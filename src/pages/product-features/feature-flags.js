                            Releasing new features can be difficult. As much as your team may find the feature amazing,
                            you cannot be sure of how it will impact your users. With feature flags, rolling out new
                            features becomes less stressful. You can choose to slowly roll out features to a certain
                            percentages of your users, and increase or decrease that percentage accordingly.

                            Maybe you want to see how your users react to different text on a button, or a new navbar
                            style. With feature flags, you can roll out a change to only a percentage of users and see
                            how that affects the UX through the various analytics tools PostHog provides. You can then
                            decide to fully implement the change or simply roll it back.

                        <p>
                            Maybe your new feature didn’t turn out to be as exciting to your users, or perhaps it still
                            needs a few tweaks. No problem. Safely roll back features without serious consequences and
                            only make definite changes to your app when you’re certain they’re good to go!

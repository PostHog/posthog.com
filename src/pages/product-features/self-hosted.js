                            We strive to make our deployment process as simple as possible. As a result, we offer a wide
                            variety of ways to deploy PostHog, so you can pick the one that suits you best.
                            Additionally, it’s up to you where you deploy it! This gives you more freedom and prevents
                            PostHog from disrupting your tech stack.

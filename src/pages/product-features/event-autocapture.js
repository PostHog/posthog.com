                            PostHog starts capturing events from the second the setup is complete - no extra steps
                            required. We also provide various ways to deploy in just one click, such as{' '}
                            <Link to="/docs/deployment/deploy-heroku">Heroku</Link>,{' '}
                            <Link to="/docs/deployment/deploy-heroku">AWS</Link>, and{' '}
                            <Link to="/docs/deployment/deploy-linode">Linode</Link>. This way, you can go from first
                            hearing about PostHog to capturing your first event in less than an hour.

                            Event autocapture means you don’t have to worry about missing important events while you
                            figure out your setup. By default, PostHog captures a wide variety of events that are
                            important to you, from page views to button clicks. As such, from the moment you deploy,
                            you’re already gathering useful data!

                    <h2 className="number row03">03</h2>
                    <div className="rowContents row03">
                        <h2>Customize as you wish</h2>
                        <hr className="redLine" />
                        <p>
                            Event autocapture is a great way to get started, but you might want some added customization
                            to improve your analytics processes. With PostHog you can set up actions (link to Actions)
                            for new or already-existing events. This helps you filter through autocaptured events, as
                            well as create more complex logic that isn’t possible with just autocapture.

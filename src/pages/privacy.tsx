                            will be public-facing for the open sharing of innovative developments, ideas, and
                            information that makes our collaborative community so great. While we are committed to open
                            sharing, we strive to respect the privacy of individual community members and will minimize
                            the information we collect and share. If you do not want to share your information,
                            including personally identifiable information, with other community members and the public,
                            please be thoughtful as to how you interact with our Websites and what information you
                            provide through the Websites (for example, through creating a public profile, project

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Right of access to your personal information, to know what information we hold about
                                you.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Right to correct any incorrect or incomplete personal information about yourself that we
                                hold.
                            </li>
                            <li>Right to restrict/suspend our processing of your personal information.</li>
                            <li>
                                Right to complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy rights are
                                being violated. In the UK, this will be the Information Commissioner.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent or a contract and the
                                processing carried out by automated means);
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent). If you ask to
                                withdraw your consent, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place
                                at that time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests)</li>
                            <li>Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes</li>
                            <li>
                                Right of erasure of your personal data from our system ("right to be forgotten") if
                                certain grounds are met
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal
                            information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are
                            required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where we collect personal information to administer your accounts or your contract with us
                            or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory and we will not be able to manage
                            our relationship with you without this. In all other cases, the provision of requested
                            personal information is optional, but this may affect your ability to participate in certain
                            Website-related activities or being able to access and use certain features and services,
                            where the information is needed for those purposes.

                            If you already have an account on the Websites, you may access, update, alter, or delete
                            your basic customer profile information by logging into your account and updating profile
                            settings.

                        <p>
                            PostHog will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to
                            perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the Website, to comply
                            with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.
                            Retention periods will be determined taking into account the type of information that is
                            collected and the purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements
                            applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the
                            earliest reasonable opportunity. For instance, in respect of data held for the management of
                            customers and potential customers, we consider the lead time necessary to develop and
                            maintain our commercial relationships and how recent our interactions are with you. We may
                            rectify, update or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own
                            discretion. For more information on our retention periods you can contact us using the
                            details in the “Contacting PostHog About Your Privacy” section of this Privacy Policy.

                            may retain limited personal information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional
                            integrity and nonrepudiation. For example, if you provide your information in connection
                            with a blog post, GitHub issue or comment, we may display that information even if you have
                            deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, as described
                            in our <Link href="/terms">Terms of Use</Link>, if you contribute to a PostHog project and
                            provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, that information
                            (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution and we
                            will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.
